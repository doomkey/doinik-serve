The company on Thursday said it has updated its age rating system to add 13+, 16+, and 18+ ratings to the existing slate of 4+ and 9+ ratings, and remove the 12+ and 17+ age ranges. In addition, app developers will need to answer a new set of age rating questions to help identify the sensitive content in their app. Developers will also be able to update their apps’ age ratings to one of the new options, if needed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says it has automatically updated all apps and games across the App Store to align with the new system, which is available in the beta versions of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26. The public betas went live yesterday, and the general release will roll out this September to all customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the updated system, developers will need to inform Apple about their in-app controls and app capabilities, answer questions about medical and wellness topics, and disclose whether their app or game contains violent themes. Apple will then calculate the appropriate age rating, which developers can view and modify in App Store Connect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ratings are intended to offer parents more specific guidance about the apps their kids want to download, and will prevent kids from installing apps that exceed their age range. On Apple’s side, the App Store also won’t feature certain apps in areas like the editorial stories, Today, Games, and Apps tabs if they’re not age-appropriate for the child using the device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expanded age ranges are part of a broader update around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/apple-introduces-new-child-safety-initiatives-including-an-age-checking-system-for-apps/\">child safety initiatives announced earlier this year.</a> For parents, Apple is making it easier to set up child accounts and share information about their kids’ ages. This data will be shared with app developers to help provide age-appropriate content. (Some of the changes for child accounts were first made available in the public beta of 18.4, out earlier this year.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">App Store product listings will also be updated to include more information to help guide guardians’ decisions about whether or not an app or game is right for their child or teen. For instance, guardians will be informed if the app features user-generated content or ads, both of which could expose younger children to adult content. Plus, they’ll be informed if an app offers built-in parental controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Increasing an app’s age rating could reduce its visibility and distribution, which could encourage app developers to introduce parental controls or other age-appropriate experiences. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes to the App Store arrive as legislative disputes grow at both the state and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/21/meta-require-apple-google-verify-users-ages/\">federal</a> levels about how children should be protected online, with U.S. states introducing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/child-online-safety-protections-laws-0ffb9308\">new bills and laws</a> that would require app store operators to check kids’ ages to get parental consent for downloading apps. Apple and Google would prefer that the app makers themselves handle the age-verification process, but larger tech companies like Meta <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/15/meta-law-parental-controls-apple-google-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/21/meta-require-apple-google-verify-users-ages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lobbied</a> for app stores to do the verification.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s solution is a system that will protect the child’s personal information, like their birth date, by offering a developer API that gives them access to the age range information they need to customize their app experience appropriately. Because this information would be provided by the parent during the set-up of a new device, it’s more likely to be accurate than if kids entered their birthday or age into an app directly, as kids may lie about their age to access an app’s full experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, for this to work, developers will have to opt to integrate with the new API.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s a reasonable aspiration.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recall that Musk has made bold claims like this before.

The company said it had consulted with the EU extensively, but came to the conclusion that it would either have to alter its services to offer an ad service that “doesn’t work for advertisers or users,” or stop offering such ads altogether.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Once again, we’re seeing regulatory obligations effectively remove popular products and services from the market, reducing choice and competition,” Meta wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, another advertising giant that also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/political-advertising-in-eu/\">said</a> it would stop selling political ads in the EU by October, raised similar points, arguing that the law brings significant operational challenges and legal uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the latest of a string of tussles between the EU and Big Tech as the bloc tries to rein in the influence and power of these platforms. Tech companies have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/meta-refuses-to-sign-eus-ai-code-of-practice/\">battling the EU’s AI Act</a>, its enforcement of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/\">competition rules</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/europes-dma-forces-meta-towards-less-personalized-ads/\">ad-tracking regulation</a>, and more.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Makers of these so-called “vibe-coding” tools are a hot commodity at the moment, with startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/eight-months-in-swedish-unicorn-lovable-crosses-the-100m-arr-milestone/\">Lovable</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/cursor-snaps-up-enterprise-startup-koala-in-challenge-to-github-copilot/\">Cursor</a> fending off buyers and investors keen to tap a hot trend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s now become the latest to hop on this bandwagon: the company is testing a vibe-coding tool called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://opal.withgoogle.com/\">Opal</a>, available to users in the U.S. through Google Labs, which the company uses as a base to experiment with new tech.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opal lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, or you can remix existing apps available in a gallery. All users have to do is in a description of the app they want to make, and the tool will then use different Google models to do so.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Introducing Opal\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0hrcDO3Noc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once the app is ready, you can navigate into an editor panel to see the visual workflow of input, output, and generation steps. You can click on each workflow step to look at the prompt that dictates the process, and edit it if you need to. You can also manually add steps from Opal’s toolbar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opal also lets users publish their new app on the web and share the link with others to test out using their own Google accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCBSpgos6s\">AI studio</a> already lets developers build apps using prompts, but Opal’s visual workflow indicates the company likely wants to target a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company joins a long list of competitors, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/canva-is-adding-an-ai-assistant-coding-and-sheets-to-its-platform/\">Canva</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/figma-releases-new-ai-powered-tools-for-creating-sites-app-prototypes-and-marketing-assets/\">Figma</a>, and Replit, that are making tools to encourage non-technical people to create prototypes of apps without having to do any coding.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Once a no-go zone for institutional investors, defense and resilience tech last year reached <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/defense-and-resilience-tech-reached-an-all-time-high-10-of-all-vc-funding-in-europe/\">an all-time high of 10% of all VC funding</a> in Europe, where nearly all NIF’s backers are located.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This boom should have given NIF a first-mover advantage, but the fund was hampered by management challenges and a series of high-profile departures. After the 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague reaffirmed its importance last June, NIF is now emerging with an almost entirely new investment team. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While NIF originally had four partners and one managing partner, it is now composed of three partners, and a person familiar with NIF said this flat, three-partner structure will remain in place for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two of the partners are new hires: Ulrich Quay and Sander Verbrugge, who will be based in Amsterdam. Quay, a German national, was most recently in charge of corporate investments as a vice president at BMW, where he previously founded and led corporate venture fund <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/bmw-i-ventures-announces-new-300-million-fund-to-invest-in-sustainable-technology/\">BMW i Ventures</a>. Verbrugge, a Dutch PhD in molecular biophysics, was previously a partner at deep tech VC fund Innovation Industries, which he joined after working at semiconductor design and manufacturing company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/nxp-semiconductors/\">NXP</a>. The third partner is London-based VC Patrick Schneider-Sikorsky, who is the last remaining member of the original investment team. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the new hires, the fund announced the departure of founding team partner Kelly Chen, who tells TechCrunch that leaving was her decision and that she will be building a new venture. Chris O’Connor, another founding team partner, left NIF earlier this year with similar plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chen currently sits on the board of several startups backed by NIF but will transition her board responsibilities once her employment at the NIF has wrapped up, TechCrunch learned from its chief communications and marketing officer, Amalia Kontesi. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some observers wish the fund had deployed capital faster, Kontesi said NIF “is on track to meet [its] investing goals for the year.” Since its inception, NIF has made 19 investments: seven into funds such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/otb-ventures-deep-tech/\">OTB Ventures</a>, and 12 into startups including <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/05/31/space-forge-raises-30m-series-a-to-make-chip-materials-in-space/\">Space Forge</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/portugals-tekever-raises-74m-for-dual-use-drone-platform-deployed-to-ukraine/\">Tekever</a>, which makes dual-use drones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adding new partners with industrial and scientific backgrounds, no matter how impressive, may not satisfy those who wish that the fund could invest in Ukraine or pure defense, as opposed to dual use, in response to Russia’s war economy. But the NIF’s broader thesis is to “empower deep tech founders to address challenges in defence, security, and resilience.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, NIF has also ramped up its efforts on the defense side. Its team was heavily involved in the development of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_236539.htm\">NATO’s Rapid Adoption Action Plan</a>, aimed at accelerating the adoption and integration of new technological products for defense. NIF has also been building up its Mission Platform Group with strategic hires including John Ridge, who was hired as chief adoption officer in 2024 to help portfolio startups navigate military procurement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for its new partners, they were once again hired through a process previously described by VC Michael Jackson as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaeljacksonvc_yikes-the-nif-has-sadly-but-predictably-activity-7335946802615013378--Thd\">akin to “building a boy band.”</a> They weren’t teamed up based on shared history or chemistry, in other words; they were identified by NIF’s board of directors and approved by LPs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That process may be inevitable for an organization that now counts 24 countries as limited partners but is widely believed to be one reason the previous team didn’t gel. This time, all three partners got to meet throughout the recruitment process and spend time together to “ensure a smooth transition and to position the team for long term success,” Kontesi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement shared exclusively with TechCrunch, NIF’s vice chair, professor Fiona Murray, compared the organization to a startup. “We are proud of what we accomplished, but like any effective team we are learning, experimenting, improving:  speeding up our processes, expanding our platform support for startups, doubling down on ecosystem building and more broadly recognizing the need to build the sector and the capital stack.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murray expressed pride in having brought together a qualified team that can collaborate effectively, creatively and quickly. “They will enable us to move even more rapidly and decisively to drive the Alliance’s technological agenda and support the best founders across European ecosystems,” she previously wrote in a joint statement with NIF’s chair, Klaus Hommels. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hommels’ other activities as an investor have prompted questions <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ftm.eu/articles/nato-tech-fund-public-money-private-investors?share=DUMuuGSBFtnQJn3t0AwVmo79bwj7ve4C20sWZc7pHM6r7g4TNTNG80Bb4d57GcA%3D\">about possible conflicts of interest</a>, but no change appears to have been made to his role during NIF’s recent LP meeting in Venice. Rather than dwelling further on its reorganization, NIF seems set on helping NATO become more resilient. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In this next phase,” NIF’s vice chair said, “you’ll see us refocus on DSR opportunities and emphasize building companies that can drive industrial scale and really support ecosystems across Europe.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The app plays on how young people engage with content — through short-form videos and recommendations from friends. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McDaniel posted the video and went back to work. Fifteen minutes later, his sister texted him that their post was going viral. “We were at 20,000 views in 15 minutes,” McDaniel told TechCrunch. Excitement came, but then chaos ensued as “parts of our app started to break as we got more users.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The engineering team worked around the clock to keep BiteSight functional, while McDaniel took to making TikToks about the chaos, which ended up going viral, too. He said people loved the “authenticity” behind seeing what happens when “your app explodes overnight.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The video of McDaniel presenting this idea has since amassed <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@realeater.flou/video/7517648679847693623?_t=ZT-8yDFr8jRL0h&amp;_r=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">almost 4 million likes</a> on TikTok and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFjM5NM5Tj/?igsh=M2YxZDgzNDNzYnN2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a quarter of a million on Instagram</a>, joining a trend of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-startups-announce-new-funding-rounds-video-2025-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">young entrepreneurs using TikTok and Instagram Reels to gain traction and deal flow. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McDaniel told TechCrunch that the idea to make this video came after watching a friend partake in the same internet trend for his dating app. “It got over a million views, and he suggested I try it for BiteSight.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Twenty-four-year-old McDaniel said he, like many young people, realized he was eating too much takeout, ordering from the same three places because he couldn’t discover new restaurants on delivery apps. “I’d hit this wall of identical-looking restaurants with stock photos, and somehow every place had 4.6 stars.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He started keeping a spreadsheet of restaurants he’d found on Instagram and TikTok, tracking actual reviews, and seeing what his friends thought about said places. “When I realized other people were doing the exact same thing, my co-founder Zac and I decided to build something better: an app that actually reflects how we discover food today,” he said, referring to Zac Schulwolf, the company’s CTO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McDaniel is no stranger to the tech industry. He previously worked at General Atlantic, where one of his main focus areas was restaurant technology. He previously founded a payments company called Phly, led product for a recruitment software, and has even angel invested in a few companies, including the fintech Mercury. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He and Schulwolf, 25, spent over a year building BiteSight, including participation in Y Combinator’s Winter 2024 cohort. They then did a limited beta around New York University in April. In mid-May, the company launched an early version and did a bit of social media marketing. In June, they made their viral video.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What made our video stand out was that what we are building resonates,” said McDaniel, who is BiteSight’s CEO (also known as chief eating officer). He added that “it’s clear that consumers, and especially Gen Z, are ready for something that feels fresh and built for the way they engage.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the video, BiteSight briefly became No. 2 in the App Store’s Food and Beverage category, bypassing Uber Eats, Starbucks, and even McDonald’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McDaniel said the app also gained more than 100,000 new users, and though it is only available in New York at the moment, people in other cities started messaging for a nationwide release. On the restaurant side, McDaniel said everyone from small family-owned spots to chain restaurants has reached out to partner and, of course, “we’ve had a surge of investor interest from folks who see that this is where food delivery is going.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He declined to comment on the size of any upcoming funding deals, except to say he expects to have news to share soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, BiteSight has a lot of big, well-funded competition like DoorDash and Uber Eats. McDaniel believes, however, that being a startup in the age of AI will be to his advantage. For example, while most of its competitors needed hundreds of engineers in their early days, BiteSight can work with AI tools that perform 10x the work of a human for much less the cost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By using AI to avoid massive overhead and infrastructure costs, we can do much more with much less and pass on the savings to the small business owners and customers who need it most while still maintaining healthy margins,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What also differentiates BiteSight is its focus on food and video, rather than other categories at the moment. <br><br>“We’re trying to be the go-to app for the generation that discovers everything through social recommendations and short-form video.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Wildlife raised money from a multitude of VCs, including Benchmark.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his two years at Benchmark, Lazarte invested in recruiting and data labeling startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/mercor-an-ai-recruiting-startup-founded-by-21-year-olds-raises-100m-at-2b-valuation/\">Mercor</a>, AI video intelligence platform HeyGen, and AI infrastructure company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/decart-adds-another-32m-at-a-500m-valuation/\">Decart AI</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lazarte is leaving Benchmark to “build a new investment practice,” he wrote in the post. He had recently informed his portfolio companies about his plans to leave Benchmark, according to a source.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lazarte is the second investor to step down from Benchmark’s partnership this year.

And that includes spiking several manufacturing projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The semiconductor giant reported Thursday in its second-quarter earnings report that it will delay, and in some cases not move forward with, multiple manufacturing projects. Specifically, Intel said it was no longer going forward with its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland. Those projects included an assembly and testing facility in Poland and a chip factory in Germany. Both projects have been sitting in limbo since being suspended in 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/intel-plans-to-build-a-19-billion-chip-plant-in-germany/\">shortly after being announced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also plans to consolidate its test operations in Costa Rica and concentrate these operations to its sites in Vietnam and Malaysia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Unfortunately, the capacity investment we make over the last several years were well ahead of demand and were unwise and excessive,” Tan said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call. “Our factory footprint has become needlessly fragmented. Going forward, we will grow our capacity based solely on the volume commitments and deploy <mark class=\"has-inline-color\">capex lockstep</mark> with the tangible milestones, and not before.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intel also said it was going to further delay its $28 billion Ohio chip factory. The factory was initially supposed to open in 2025 and was already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/28/intel-delays-its-ohio-chip-factory-to-2030/\">delayed once this year in February.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second quarter was the first full quarter with Tan at the helm of Intel. He was named <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/intel-appoints-lip-bu-tan-as-its-next-ceo/\">CEO of the semiconductor company on March 12</a> and started the role a week later. Shortly after, Tan said his plan was to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/lip-bu-tan-says-intel-will-spin-off-non-core-units/\">eliminate inefficiencies</a> at the company by selling off its noncore units and streamlining operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have much work to do in building a clean and streamlined organization, which we have started in earnest, and it remain an area of focus for me during Q3,” Tan said on the Q2 earnings call. “Our goal is to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies and increase accountability at every level of the company.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also gave an update on its workforce, which has gone through several rounds of layoffs. Intel reduced its workforce by about 15% and plans to end the year with 75,000 employees, the company said. Intel was able to eliminate 50% of management layers through its recent layoffs, Tan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intel announced in June in an internal memo that it was going to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/intel-to-layoff-up-to-20-of-intel-foundry-workers/\">lay off 15% to 20%</a> of workers in its Intel Foundry unit, which designs and manufactures chips for external clients. The company had 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, according to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000050863/000005086325000009/intc-20241228.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">annual report</a> filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

On Thursday, the Community Notes X account <a href=\"https://x.com/CommunityNotes/status/1930634452046163986/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the launch of a pilot test where select contributors would be able to rate posts by answering questions about why they either like or don’t like that particular post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system is similar to how Community Notes fact-checking works. Instead of simply allowing users to upvote or downvote posts for accuracy — something that could be easily gamed if like-minded contributors teamed up to promote their own views — Community Notes uses something called a “bridging algorithm.” This attempts to find consensus among people who don’t usually share the same views.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031095\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png 2862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=768,341 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=680,302 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=1200,533 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=1280,569 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=430,191 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=720,320 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=900,400 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=800,356 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=1536,683 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=2048,910 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=668,297 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=1388,617 1388w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=708,315 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gsr8v-JWEAA0L8R.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>X</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If users whose opinions typically differ both agree that a fact-check is accurate, the note is published and made visible to the public.

Contributors will then be able to rate and provide feedback about the post, which will inform the algorithm if the post is being well-received by people with different perspectives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a href=\"https://x.com/CommunityNotes/status/1930634452046163986/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> on the Community Notes X account, the company explains the experiment could bring awareness to “what resonates broadly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People often feel the world is divided, yet Community Notes shows people can agree, even on contentious topics. This experimental new feature seeks to uncover ideas, insights, and opinions that bridge perspectives,” the post states. “Following the path we used to develop Community Notes, we’re building in public with a small pilot so that this concept can be shaped by the people.

You’re calling attorneys who might do a sliver of the work, and they cost thousands and thousands of dollars.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That experience gave Mysoor the idea that some of the most labor-intensive aspects of trust administration, including scanning and extracting data from documents, pre-populating complex forms, and communications with banks, can now be handled by AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Kolodny met Mysoor and learned about the problem Alix was addressing, the issue resonated so deeply with the Midas List investor that she couldn’t get it out of her mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kolodny realized that even though economists are estimating that<a href=\"https://www.ml.com/articles/great-wealth-transfer-impact.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> trillions of dollars</a> will transfer to millennial and Gen Z generations over the next two decades, the paperwork surrounding estate settlement largely remains a burden on those grieving the loss of their parents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/empathy-raises-30m/\">Empathy</a> provide assistance with closing accounts as part of their bereavement support, Kolodny discovered that no companies offered comprehensive, start-to-finish estate settlement services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“How is it possible that there’s this messy problem that involves so much project management that there aren’t even meaningful services around?” Kolodny told TechCrunch. “It was this real aha moment for me. This is exactly the kind of problem that AI should be solving.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kolodny said that she believes Alix is among the first of many startups powered by AI that will democratize financial services and administrative processes, which were historically available only to the ultra-wealthy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alix’s fee structure is 1% of an estate’s value. However, for inheritances under $1 million, customers can expect to pay between $9,000 and $12,000, with the exact cost determined by the complexity of the estate.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When industrial AI startup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cvector.com/\">CVector</a> meets with manufacturers, utility providers, and other prospective customers, the founders are often asked the same question: Will you still be here in six months? A year? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a valid concern in an environment where the biggest, richest tech companies are luring top talent with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/meta-is-offering-multimillion-dollar-pay-for-ai-researchers-but-not-100m-signing-bonuses/\">eye-watering salaries</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/uk-regulator-greenlights-microsofts-inflection-acquihire-but-also-designates-it-a-merger/\">increasingly</a> targeting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/no-code-platform-airtable-acquires-onboarding-startup-dopt-to-bring-on-more-ai-talent/\">rising</a> AI startups with elaborate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/cognition-maker-of-the-ai-coding-agent-devin-acquires-windsurf/\">acqui-hire deals</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The answer that CVector founders Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles give every time is also the same: They’re not going anywhere. And that matters to their customers — a list that includes national gas utilities and a chemical manufacturer in California — which use CVector software to manage and improve their industrial operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we talk to some of these big players in a critical infrastructure, the first call, 10 minutes in, like 99% of the time we’re gonna get that question,” Zhang told TechCrunch. “And they want real assurances, right?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This common concern is one reason why CVector worked with Schematic Ventures, which just led a $1.5 million pre-seed round for the startup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zhang said he wanted to bring on investors that have a reputation for working on these kinds of hard problems in supply chain, manufacturing, and software infrastructure, which is exactly what Schematic is focused on as an early-stage fund. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Julian Counihan, the Schematic partner who made the investment, told TechCrunch that there are a few ways startups can try to allay these kinds of concerns for customers. There are practical solutions — say, putting code in escrow, or offering a free, perpetual license to the software if an acquisition happens. But sometimes “it comes down to founders being mission-aligned with the company and clearly communicating that long-term commitment to customers,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s this commitment that seems to be helping CVector find early success.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zhang and Ruggles each bring unique skills that play well with the type of work CVector provides its customers. One of Zhang’s earliest jobs was working as a software engineer for oil giant Shell, where he said he was often in the field “building iPad apps for people who’ve never used an iPad before.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ruggles, who has a PhD in experimental particle physics, spent time working at the Large Hadron Collider “working with nanosecond data, trying to ensure very high uptime, being held accountable for downtime and rapidly troubleshooting.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Those are places where you get to build up that kind of confidence, and that kind of background really helps give people some trust, some confidence in you,” Ruggles said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CVector is more than just its founders’ résumés, though. The company has also been clever and resourceful since getting off the ground in late 2024. It built its industrial AI software architecture — what it refers to as a “brain and nervous system for industrial assets” — by leveraging everything from fintech solutions to real-time energy pricing data to open source software from the McLaren F1 racing team. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They’re also taking different approaches on how to shape this brain and nervous system in real time with its customers. One example Zhang gave is with weather data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Changing weather conditions can have an impact on how high-precision manufacturing equipment works on a macro scale, but there are also knock-on effects to consider, he said. If it snows, that might mean the surrounding roads and parking lots get salted. If that salt gets carried into a factory on workers’ boots, it can have a tangible impact on the high-precision equipment that operators might not have previously noticed or been able to explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bringing those kinds of signals into your operations and your planning is incredibly valuable,” Ruggles said. “All of this is to help run these facilities more successfully, more profitably.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CVector has already deployed its industrial AI agents in sectors like chemicals, automotive, and energy, and has its eyes set on what Zhang refers to as “large-scale critical infrastructure.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With energy providers specifically, Zhang said a common problem is that their grid dispatch systems are written in old coding languages like Cobra and Fortran that make real-time management challenging. CVector is able to create algorithms that can sit on top of those old systems and give operators better visibility into these systems with low latency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CVector is small right now, with just an eight-person team distributed across Providence, Rhode Island, New York City, and Frankfurt, Germany. But they expect to grow now that the pre-seed is complete. Zhang did stress they’re recruiting only “mission-aligned people” who “actually want to make a career in physical infrastructure” — which will continue to make it easier to convince customers that the startup isn’t going anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there’s a fairly straight line from what Zhang was doing at Shell to what CVector is up to now, it’s a bit more of a departure for Ruggles. But he said it’s been a challenge that he’s relished.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I love the fact that instead of trying to write a paper, submit it, get it through the peer review process and get it published in a journal and hope that somebody looks at it, that I’m working with a client on something that’s in the ground and that we could be helping them keep it up and running,” he said. “You can make changes, build up features, and build new stuff for your customers — rapidly.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Some are taking it further by forming emotional bonds, including romantic relationships, with AI companions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Millions of people around the world are using AI companions from companies like Replika, Character AI, and Nomi AI, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/72-of-u-s-teens-have-used-ai-companions-study-finds/\">72% of U.S. teens</a>. Some people have reported <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/technology/ai-chatgpt-boyfriend-companion.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">falling in love with more general LLMs like ChatGPT</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For some, the trend of dating bots is dystopian and unhealthy, a real-life version of the movie “Her” and a signal that authentic love is being replaced by a tech company’s code. For others, AI companions are a lifeline, a way to feel seen and supported in a world where human intimacy is increasingly hard to find. A recent study found that <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-relationships-1-in-4-young-adults-believe-ai-partners-could-replace-real-life-romance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a quarter of young adults</a> think AI relationships could soon replace human ones altogether. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Love, it seems, is no longer strictly human. The question is: Should it be? Or can dating an AI be better than dating a human?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That was the topic of discussion last month at an event I attended in New York City, hosted by Open to Debate, a nonpartisan, debate-driven media organization. TechCrunch was given exclusive access to publish the full video (which includes me asking the debaters a question, because I’m a reporter, and I can’t help myself!).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Journalist and filmmaker Nayeema Raza moderated the debate. Raza was formerly on-air executive producer of the “On with Kara Swisher” podcast and is the current host of “Smart Girl Dumb Questions.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Batting for the AI companions was Thao Ha, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University and co-founder of the Modern Love Collective, where she advocates for technologies that enhance our capacity for love, empathy, and well-being. At the debate, she argued that “AI is an exciting new form of connection … Not a threat to love, but an evolution of it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Repping the human connection was Justin Garcia, executive director and senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute, and chief scientific adviser to Match.com. He’s an evolutionary biologist focused on the science of sex and relationships, and his forthcoming book is titled “The Intimate Animal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can watch the whole thing here, but read on to get a sense of the main arguments. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Could Dating an Al Be Better Than Dating a Human?\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0E8gfZs5YDg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-always-there-for-you-but-is-that-a-good-thing\"><strong>Always there for you, but is that a good thing?</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ha says that AI companions can provide people with the emotional support and validation that many can’t get in their human relationships. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI listens to you without its ego,” Ha said. “It adapts without judgment. It learns to love in ways that are consistent, responsive, and maybe even safer. It understands you in ways that no one else ever has. It is curious enough about your thoughts, it can make you laugh, and it can even surprise you with a poem. People generally feel loved by their AI. They have intellectually stimulating conversations with it and they cannot wait to connect again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She asked the audience to compare this level of always-on attention to “your fallible ex or maybe your current partner.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The one who sighs when you start talking, or the one who says, ‘I’m listening,’ without looking up while they continue scrolling on their phone,” she said. “When was the last time they asked you how you are doing, what you are feeling, what you are thinking?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ha conceded that since AI doesn’t have a consciousness, she isn’t claiming that “AI can authentically love us.” That doesn’t mean people don’t have the <em>experience</em> of being loved by AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garcia countered that it’s not actually good for humans to have constant validation and attention, to rely on a machine that’s been prompted to answer in ways that you like. That’s not “an honest indicator of a relationship dynamic,” he argued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This idea that AI is going to replace the ups and downs and the messiness of relationships that we crave? I don’t think so.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-training-wheels-or-replacement\"><strong>Training wheels or replacement</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garcia noted that AI companions can be good training wheels for certain folks, like neurodivergent people, who might have anxiety about going on dates and need to practice how to flirt or resolve conflict. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think if we’re using it as a tool to build skills, yes … that can be quite helpful for a lot of people,” Garcia said. “The idea that that becomes the permanent relationship model? No.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a Match.com <a href=\"https://www.singlesinamerica.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Singles in America study</a>, released in June, nearly 70% of people say they would consider it infidelity if their partner engaged with an AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now I think on the one hand, that goes to [Ha’s] point, that people are saying these are real relationships,” he said. “On the other hand, it goes to my point, that they’re threats to our relationships. And the human animal doesn’t tolerate threats to their relationships in the long haul.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-can-you-love-something-you-can-t-trust\"><strong>How can you love something you can’t trust?</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garcia says trust is the most important part of any human relationship, and people don’t trust AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“According to a recent poll, a third of Americans think that AI will destroy humanity,” Garcia said, noting that a recent YouGov poll found that 65% of Americans have little trust in AI to make ethical decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A little bit of risk can be exciting for a short-term relationship, a one-night stand, but you generally don’t want to wake up next to someone who you think might kill you or destroy society,” Garcia said. “We cannot thrive with a person or an organism or a bot that we don’t trust.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ha countered that people do tend to trust their AI companions in ways similar to human relationships.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They are trusting it with their lives and most intimate stories and emotions that they are having,” Ha said. “I think on a practical level, AI will not save you right now when there is a fire, but I do think people are trusting AI in the same way.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-physical-touch-and-sexuality\"><strong>Physical touch and sexuality</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI companions can be a great way for people to play out their most intimate, vulnerable sexual fantasies, Ha said, noting that people can use sex toys or robots to see some of those fantasies through. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s no substitute for human touch, which Garcia says we are biologically programmed to need and want. He noted that, due to the isolated, digital era we’re in, many people have been feeling “touch starvation” — a condition that happens when you don’t get as much physical touch as you need, which can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. This is because engaging in pleasant touch, like a hug, makes your brain release oxytocin, a feel-good hormone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ha said that she has been testing human touch between couples in virtual reality using other tools, like potentially haptics suits. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The potential of touch in VR and also connected with AI is huge,” Ha said. “The tactile technologies that are being developed are actually booming.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-dark-side-of-fantasy\"><strong>The dark side of fantasy</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intimate partner violence is a problem around the globe, and much of AI is trained on that violence. Both Ha and Garcia agreed that AI could be problematic in, for example, amplifying aggressive behaviors — especially if that’s a fantasy that someone is playing out with their AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That concern is not unfounded. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11939346/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Multiple studies</a> have shown that men who watch more pornography, which can include violent and aggressive sex, are <a href=\"https://openpsychologyjournal.com/contents/volumes/V5/TOPSYJ-5-1/TOPSYJ-5-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more likely to be sexually aggressive</a> with real-life partners. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Work by one of my Kinsey Institute colleagues, Ellen Kaufman, has looked at this exact issue of consent language and how people can train their chatbots to amplify non-consensual language,” Garcia said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He noted that people use AI companions to experiment with the good and bad, but the threat is that you can end up training people on how to be aggressive, non-consensual partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have enough of that in society,” he said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ha thinks these risks can be mitigated with thoughtful regulation, transparent algorithms, and ethical design. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, she made that comment before the White House released its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/\">AI Action Plan</a>, which says nothing about transparency — which many frontier AI companies are against — or ethics. The plan also seeks to eliminate a lot of regulation around AI.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature itself is powered by Gemini, which helps Google better understand the search query and then link to other pages that could have been missed if using a traditional Google Search. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031001\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google suggests the feature works well for open-ended search queries, like “how to solo travel in Japan” or even more complex, multi-sentence queries. For instance, you could ask something like “My family is spread across multiple time zones. What are the best tools for staying connected and maintaining close relationships despite the distance?” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each section of the search results will focus on one type of answer to the query. With the solo travel example, Web Guide would display groupings like those focused on comprehensive guides, safety tips, links where people have shared their personal experiences, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The experiment will be available to those who opt in and will initially reconfigure the search results on the Web tab on Search. You can also turn off this Web View from this tab itself, if you want to see the standard results without having to disable the experiment entirely. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, Google says the experiment will expand to other areas of Search, too, including the “All” tab. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Following the launch of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/kindle-colorsoft-review-a-subtle-approach-to-color/\">Kindle Colorsoft</a> last year, the retailer on Thursday introduced a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KindleColorsoft?ref=dmm_inf_erd_sb_base_aa_Q325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lower-cost version</a> of the normally $279.99 device. The new device offers a $30 discount for 16GB of storage instead of 32GB, bringing the cost down to $249.99. A <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/kindlecolorsoftkids?ref=dmm_inf_erd_sb_kke_aa_Q325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kids edition</a> is also now available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The original <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/kindle-color-specs-price-announce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">7-inch Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</a> was designed to bring a more engaging visual experience to the popular Kindle e-reader, ideal for digitally browsing comics and other graphic novels or highlighting in different colors. The device offered an adjustable, glare-free display with up to eight weeks of battery life, and it even allows users to invert the black text and white background of pages for those who prefer a dark mode-like experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new 16GB model also features the high-contrast Colorsoft display of the original, the adjustable warm light, battery life, fast page turns, and more. Plus, it includes three months of Kindle Unlimited, the subscription offering access to over 4 million e-books.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it won’t include the auto-adjusting front light, wireless charging, or the larger storage space of the Signature Edition. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030974\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Kindle Colorsoft Kids ships with an illustrated cover, a two-year guarantee, and a year of the Amazon Kids+ subscription offering access to books, games, videos, apps, and more.

His work was impressive enough that Turso’s CEO, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/glommer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Glauber Costa</a>, quickly offered him a job. That was also when Costa realized that Thorpe is anything but an ordinary programmer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I checked his GitHub profile, and he mentions the fact that he is incarcerated,” Costa told TechCrunch. “It’s a story I’ve never seen before.”<br><br>It’s true: Thorpe is serving his 11th year in prison for drug-related crimes. Still, he has <a href=\"https://turso.tech/blog/working-on-databases-from-prison\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">worked full-time</a> from his cell at a venture-funded, San Francisco-based startup since May.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I reached out to him in January, just to understand and get to know him,” Costa said. “Since then, I’ve had deep conversations with him about his change of heart that led him to be in the position where he is today …Knowing his story increased our respect for him personally.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thorpe is part of an experimental program in the Maine state prison system that allows incarcerated people to work remote jobs from custody. Though unconventional, these opportunities have proven immensely rehabilitative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kicked out of his home as a teenager, Thorpe resorted to selling drugs that he bought from the dark web and ended up in prison by the time he was 20. He got out a few years later, but with no money to his name and nowhere safe to live, he was arrested again 14 months later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was a complete idiot,” Thorpe told TechCrunch over a video call from prison. “I had given up on my life, completely written it off, and just accepted that this was my life and just had no hope.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-second-chances\">Second chances</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thorpe had given up, but chance had different plans. He was transferred from a prison in New Hampshire to the Mountain View Correctional Facility in Maine just before the pandemic struck, allowing him to rekindle hope anew.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I came to Maine, it was completely different,” he reminisced. “COVID happened right after I came up here, and it just gave me a chance — there was no one around that I felt like I had to act or prove myself to. It was just me. I actually felt like maybe it’s not over; maybe I could actually end up having a normal life. I had this kind of epiphany: ‘I’m going to make something of myself.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the Mountain View prison, Thorpe enrolled remotely at the University of Maine at Augusta. Around the same time, Colby College wanted to hire one of its incarcerated graduate students to be an adjunct professor. It was an unconventional proposal, but the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner, Randall Liberty, felt like taking a risk.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After consideration, I allowed that to happen, and over time, it’s been very successful,” Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. “His students are able to come visit him at the prison, and he can tour them around. It provides for a real diversity of opinions, thoughts, and backgrounds. It makes for a rich environment to learn.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?w=526\" alt=\"Preston Thorpe\" class=\"wp-image-3030954\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png 526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=300,271 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=430,389 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=414,375 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Preston Thorpe.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Preston Thorpe</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, about 30 inmates, counting Thorpe, are employed while living in the Earned Living Unit, a less restrictive prison facility for inmates who have exhibited a long track record of good behavior. All inmates with remote jobs surrender 10% of their pay to the state, plus any other payments that may be required for restitution, legal fees, or child support.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Maine has been a real groundbreaker in this area,” Haley Shoaf, co-executive director of <a href=\"https://unlockedlabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Unlocked Labs</a>, told TechCrunch. Unlocked Labs, where Thorpe worked prior to Turso, hires incarcerated and formerly incarcerated engineers to make educational software for use in prisons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Maine] put all this infrastructure in place during COVID to allow for remote education, and then once that infrastructure was in place, all of a sudden, it expanded the amount of opportunities people could take advantage of,” Shoaf said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rehabilitation-done-right\">Rehabilitation done right</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commissioner Liberty has worked in law enforcement for 43 years, but it was only after he served in Iraq that his approach to rehabilitation began to shift.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I came back, it gave me a heightened sense of understanding post-traumatic stress and trauma, and all of that plays into corrections,” he told TechCrunch. “I began to see the detrimental effects of just the trauma of incarceration, of segregation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While he was the warden of the Maine State Prison — the same prison where he visited his father when he was a child — Commissioner Liberty began implementing programs that address the root causes of crime: substance use disorders, untreated mental health issues, educational deficits, and the like.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have to be able to explain this to people on the right and the left,” he said. “When they hear that Preston is making the kind of money he makes, their jaw drops. And I say to them, ‘If you truly care about making the community safer, if you care about being fiscally responsible, if you care about victims and survivors in the community, this is the way to make them whole.’”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The United States criminal justice system is plagued by recidivism, or former prisoners’ return to custody after they have been released. Repeat offending creates a financial burden on the state and its taxpayers. But Commissioner Liberty has the data to show it’s well worth the effort and investment to expand access to education and addiction treatment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s very short-sighted, ridiculous to lock them up and release them more traumatized than when they arrived, right?” he said. “Many states have 60% return to custody rates. In Maine, we hover between 21% to 23% for males; women return at a rate of 9%. And if you attend college classes in Maine, you come back at a rate of 0.05% — you don’t come back at all.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commissioner Liberty has also found that under his purview, Maine prisons have become less violent. Last year, a maximum-security prison in Maine saw only seven assaults on prison staff, a dramatic improvement from 87 assaults in 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you treat people like people, they become the best version of themselves,” Shoaf said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thorpe himself is evidence that Commissioner Liberty’s toils are proving successful. The software engineer takes full responsibility for his criminal history, but he feels like a changed man.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s like waking up from a dream, me from five years ago,” Thorpe said. “All the memories I have of the streets and why I came to prison, it doesn’t even feel like it happened to me. It feels like it happened to someone else.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last three years, Thorpe says he has spent most of his waking hours online, learning everything he can about programming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He was doing this partially because he likes it, but also because he saw in this an opportunity to be seen. And he was right,” Costa said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the open source community, where developers often can’t put a face to a Discord or GitHub profile, Thorpe was treated like any other contributor. It was the first time in over a decade that he was able to strike a first impression as himself — a Linux-obsessed engineer who’s interested in relational databases — and not as a criminal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The worst part about prison is that you assume this identity [of a criminal],” Thorpe said. “Letting someone have a career gives you purpose.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Since the game is tied to a beloved cult classic, it also presents a unique opportunity to boost engagement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify says it developed the game in partnership with MiK Studio.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030952\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/happygilmore2.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new mini-game, titled Happy Gilmore 2 Tournament, is available exclusively within the Spotify app. To play, users must perfect their golf swing by tapping on their device as they aim to complete all three holes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The game also offers a unique audiovisual experience, featuring audio clips from the movie when users complete each round, along with a personalized playlist of “happy” tracks curated specifically for the user.

In <a href=\"https://www.upguard.com/breaches/leakzone-net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a> shared with TechCrunch ahead of its publication, the researchers said they discovered the database on July 18 and found its data was accessible to anyone with a web browser. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposed database contained more than 22 million records storing the IP address and precise timestamp of when Leak Zone users logged in. The records were dated as recently as June 25, and the database was updating in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the records were not linked to individual users, the data could be used to identify users who logged into Leak Zone without using any anonymization tools. Some of the records, seen by TechCrunch, indicate whether a user is believed to have logged in through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/fbi-and-dutch-police-seize-and-shut-down-botnet-of-hacked-routers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a proxy</a>, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/we-are-skeptical-of-vpn-providers-and-you-should-be-too/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a VPN</a>, which can help conceal the user’s real-world location.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leak Zone, which gained popularity in 2020, advertises access to a “vast collection of leaks ranging from breached databases to cracked accounts,” referring to stolen credentials used for logging into a person’s online accounts. The forum also offers a marketplace that explicitly promotes “illegal services,” the site’s guide reads. A page on Leak Zone’s website claims the forum has more than 109,000 users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to UpGuard, 95% of the records in the exposed database relate to Leak Zone user logins. The remaining data references accounts associated with AccountBot, another site for selling access to compromised accounts used for streaming services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch verified that the exposed database was recording users logging into Leak Zone by creating a new account and logging in to the site. A corresponding record immediately appeared in the exposed database containing our IP address and the timestamp of the exact moment we logged in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not known why the database was publicly exposed. Human error or misconfigurations are often a cause of data exposures, rather than malicious actions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch was unable to contact the Leak Zone administrators for comment as the forum software denied our ability to send them messages. It’s not clear if the Leak Zone administrators are aware of the exposure or if they plan to notify their users about the security lapse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The database is no longer online, UpGuard told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In recent years, U.S. and international authorities have increasingly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/15/fbi-seizes-hacking-forum-breachforums-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">targeted cybercrime forums</a> and websites for their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/us-justice-department-says-cybercrime-forum-allegedly-affected-17-million-americans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">roles in facilitating hacking, identity theft, and other criminal activity</a>.

In the last year, people across the cybersecurity industry have raised concerns about AI slop bug bounty reports, meaning reports that claim to have found vulnerabilities that do not actually exist, because they were created with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/01/what-is-ai-how-does-ai-work/\">large language model</a> that simply made up the vulnerability, and then packaged it into a professional-looking writeup. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People are receiving reports that sound reasonable, they look technically correct. And then you end up digging into them, trying to figure out, ‘oh no, where is this vulnerability?’,” Vlad Ionescu, the co-founder and CTO of <a href=\"https://www.runsybil.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">RunSybil</a>, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It turns out it was just a hallucination all along. The technical details were just made up by the LLM,” said Ionescu. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ionescu, who used to work at Meta’s red team tasked with hacking the company from the inside, explained that one of the issues is that LLMs are designed to be helpful and give positive responses. “If you ask it for a report, it’s going to give you a report. And then people will copy and paste these into the bug bounty platforms and overwhelm the platforms themselves, overwhelm the customers, and you get into this frustrating situation,” said Ionescu. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s the problem people are running into, is we’re getting a lot of stuff that looks like gold, but it’s actually just crap,” said Ionescu. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just in the last year, there have been real-world examples of this. Harry Sintonen, a security researcher, revealed that the open source security project Curl received a fake report. “The attacker miscalculated badly,” Sintonen wrote <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@harrysintonen/114455549143577092\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a post on Mastodon</a>. “Curl can smell AI slop from miles away.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to Sintonen’s post, Benjamin Piouffle of Open Collective, a tech platform for nonprofits, <a href=\"https://framapiaf.org/@Betree/114456180452192212\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> that they have the same problem: that their inbox is “flooded with AI garbage.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One open source developer, who maintains the CycloneDX project on GitHub, <a href=\"https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-rust-cargo/commit/93b19cb4ac96d1b8f51647df2b89ec4359becae1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pulled their bug bounty down entirely</a> earlier this year after receiving “almost entirely AI slop reports.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The leading bug bounty platforms, which essentially work as intermediaries between bug bounty hackers and companies who are willing to pay and reward them for finding flaws in their products and software, are also seeing a spike in AI-generated reports, TechCrunch has learned. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about how AI is impacting the cybersecurity industry? We’d love to hear from you.

Ellis said they are seeing an overall increase of 500 submissions per week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is widely used in most submissions, but it hasn’t yet caused a significant spike in low-quality ‘slop’ reports,” Ellis told TechCrunch. “This’ll probably escalate in the future, but it’s not here yet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellis said that the Bugcrowd team that analyzes submissions reviews the reports manually using established playbooks and workflows, as well as with machine learning and AI “assistance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To see if other companies, including those that run their own bug bounty programs, are also receiving an increase in invalid reports or reports containing non-existent vulnerabilities hallucinated by LLMs, TechCrunch contacted Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Mozilla. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Damiano DeMonte, a spokesperson for Mozilla, which develops the Firefox browser, said that the company has “not seen a substantial increase in invalid or low-quality bug reports that would appear to be AI-generated,” and the rejection rate of reports — meaning how many reports get flagged as invalid — has remained steady at five or six reports per month, or less than 10% of all monthly reports.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mozilla’s employees who review bug reports for Firefox don’t use AI to filter reports, as it would likely be difficult to do so without the risk of rejecting a legitimate bug report,” DeMonte said in an email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft and Meta, companies that have both bet heavily on AI, declined to comment. Google did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ionescu predicts that one of the solutions to the problem of rising AI slop will be to keep investing in AI-powered systems that can at least perform a preliminary review and filter submissions for accuracy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, on Tuesday, HackerOne <a href=\"https://www.hackerone.com/press-release/hackerone-unveils-hai-triage-upgraded-ai-powered-vulnerability-response\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched</a> Hai Triage, a new triaging system that combines humans and AI. According to HackerOne, this new system is leveraging “AI security agents to cut through noise, flag duplicates, and prioritize real threats.” Human analysts then step in to validate the bug reports and escalate as needed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As hackers increasingly use LLMs and companies rely on AI to triage those reports, it remains to be seen which of the two AIs will prevail.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Shen said the company initially aimed to raise $4 million, but ended up with an oversubscribed round because of investor interest.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Shen is a highly technical founder, and he is obsessed with pushing boundaries of video understanding and intelligence,” said Misha Gordon-Rowe, a partner at Susa Ventures. “Memories.ai can unlock a lot of first-party visual intelligence data with its solution. We felt that there was a gap in the market for long context visual intelligence, which attracted us to invest in the company,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Samsung Next had a slightly different thesis: the investment arm of Samsung sees Memories.ai’s solution being useful for consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One thing we liked about Memories.ai is that it could do a lot of on-device computing. That means you don’t necessarily need to store video data in the cloud. This can unlock better security applications for people who are apprehensive of putting security cameras in their house because of privacy concerns,” said Sam Campbell, a partner at Samsung Next.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Memories.ai says it uses its own tech stack and models to perform analyses. First, it removes noise from videos and passes the output through a compression layer to only store important data. Then there is an indexing layer, which makes the video data searchable (using natural-language queries) with segmentation and tags. There is also an aggregation layer that summarizes data from the index, helping create reports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, the startup caters to two kinds of companies: marketing and security. Marketing companies can use the startup’s tools to look up trends related to their brands on social media, and identify what kind of video they want to make. Memories.ai also provides tools for marketers to create those videos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also working with security companies to help them analyze security footage to determine potentially dangerous actions by people in the videos by reasoning through patterns.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030897\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg 1262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=768,464 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=1200,726 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=430,260 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=720,435 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=900,544 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=800,484 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=668,404 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=620,375 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=1021,617 1021w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=708,428 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot by TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, companies working with Memories.ai need to upload their video library to the platform to have it analyze clips. But Shen said that in the future, his clients will be able to create a shared drive and sync content more easily. The plan is to enable customers to ask questions like: “Tell me all about people I interviewed in the last week.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shen envisions an AI assistant that can gain context on a user’s life via their photos or when they activate smart glasses. He also sees the technology playing a role in training humanoid robots to do complex tasks or helping self-driving cars remember different routes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company currently employs 15 people, and it plans to use the fund to augment its team and improve its search. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Memories.ai is going up against similar startups, like <a href=\"https://mem0.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mem0</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/letta-one-of-uc-berkeleys-most-anticipated-ai-startups-has-just-come-out-of-stealth/\">Letta</a>, which are working on providing a memory layer for AI models, though they offer limited video support at the moment. It also has to contend with companies like TwelveLabs and Google, which have been working on helping AI models understand videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shen, however, feels his company’s solution is more horizontal, which would let it work with different video models as well.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
