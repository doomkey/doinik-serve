The streaming company said the option will be available with the premiere of its live-streamed talent show “<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/star-search-how-to-vote-netflix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Star Search</a>” on January 20.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subscribers will be able to either pick a selection from a multiple-choice menu or rate someone’s performance on a scale of five stars. Votes can be cast using either a TV remote or the Netflix app. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix said that the feature will work globally, and on the backend, the platform will tally votes in real-time. Viewers will have a limited time to vote, and once that time has lapsed, additional votes won’t count. That means if you’re watching the show later, you can’t participate in the voting. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083737\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-CHOICE-UI-RTV-Announcement.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Netflix</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The streamer <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-quietly-launches-interactive-real-time-voting-to-its-live-streams/\">started testing live voting</a> in August 2025 with “Dinner Time Live with David Chang.” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/netflix-cto-announces-interactive-real-time-voting-for-live-content/\">During TechCrunch Disrupt 2025,</a> the company’s CTO, Elizabeth Stone, confirmed that the company would soon launch the feature widely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re sitting at home watching ‘Star Search’ on your TV, you’ll be able to either on the TV or your mobile phone actually put in a vote that advances or doesn’t advance some of the contestants on the show,” Stone had said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So it’s just a very early starting example of the ways that we think content can be more interactive over time, across devices, between TV and mobile, where a member who subscribes to Netflix can actually feel like they’re part of the story, influence the storyline, and feel immersed in that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix has heavily leaned in to live content with shows like “Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney” and “Dinner Time Live with David Chang,” along with sports broadcasts, including the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/nfl-games-on-netflix\">NFL Christmas special</a> and WWE shows.

Discovery (WBD) shareholders, Netflix is now offering cash for shares of the company, revising the cash-and-stock deal it had struck with WBD’s board earlier. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the streaming giant is still offering the same $27.75 the companies had agreed on for WBD’s movie studio and streaming assets, and the deal continues to value the company at $82.7 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new offer serves to simplify the deal structure, the companies <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-and-Warner-Bros--Discovery-Amend-Agreement-to-All-Cash-Transaction/default.aspx\">said</a> in a statement on Tuesday, “provides greater certainty of value,” and speeds up the timeline for a shareholder vote. Netflix said it would finance the deal with cash, debt, and “committed financing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change-up comes as rival suitor Paramount Skydance has intensified efforts to win over WBD’s shareholders with its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\">all-cash, $30-per-share offer</a> for the entirety of the company, including getting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/paramount-renews-bid-for-warner-bros-ensuring-40-billion-larry-ellison-backing/\">a $40 billion guarantee</a> from its CEO David Ellison’s billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paramount last week also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/paramount-nominate-directors-election-warner-bros-discovery-files-lawsuit-2026-01-12/\">sued</a> WBD for more information on Netflix’s offer and said it would nominate new members to Warner Bros.’ board, after WBD <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-hostile-bid-calls-offer-illusory/\">rebuffed</a> its offer. The company also sought to expedite the lawsuit, but the court rejected that effort.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix, for its part, had until now stuck to its original cash-and-share offer, enjoying the full backing of WBD’s board, which has resolutely rejected Paramount’s bids. WBD has argued that selling to Netflix would make for a better deal because the streaming giant has the capital to pay, and has said that Paramount’s deal poses “materially more risk,” as it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\">saddle the combined company with $87 billion in debt</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Warner Bros. has also called into question Paramount’s ability to function after the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount’s current “junk” credit rating, and has raised concerns about Paramount’s negative free cash flow, which would be exacerbated by the acquisition.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Permanent bans are a drastic action, locking people out of their profiles, memories, friend connections, and, in the case of creators and businesses, their ability to market and communicate with fans and customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the first time in the organization’s five-year history as an oversight body that permanent account bans have been a subject of the Oversight Board’s focus, the organization notes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case being reviewed isn’t exactly one of an everyday user. Instead, the case involves a high-profile Instagram user who repeatedly violated Meta’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/\">Community Standards</a> by posting visual threats of violence against a female journalist, anti-gay slurs against politicians, content depicting a sex act, allegations of misconduct against minorities, and more. The account had not accumulated enough strikes to be automatically disabled, but Meta made the decision to permanently ban the account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Board’s materials didn’t name the account in question, but its recommendations could impact others who post content that targets public figures with abuse, harassment, and threats, as well as users who have their accounts permanently banned without receiving transparent explanations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta referred this specific case to the Board, which included five posts made in the year before the account was permanently disabled. The Board says it’s looking for input about several key issues: how permanent bans can be processed fairly, the effectiveness of its current tools to protect public figures and journalists from repeated abuse and threats of violence, the challenges of identifying off-platform content, whether punitive measures effectively shape online behaviors, and best practices for transparent reporting on account enforcement decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to review the particulars of the case comes after a year in which users have complained of mass bans with little information about what they did wrong. The issue has impacted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/facebook-group-admins-complain-of-mass-bans-meta-says-its-fixing-the-problem/\">Facebook Groups</a>, as well <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/instagram-users-complain-of-mass-bans-pointing-finger-at-ai/\">as individual account holders</a> who believe that automated moderation tools are to blame. In addition, those who have been banned have complained that Meta’s paid support offering, Meta Verified, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/meta-users-say-paying-for-verified-support-has-been-useless-in-the-face-of-mass-bans/\">has proven useless to aid them</a> in these situations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether the Oversight Board has any real sway to address issues on Meta’s platform continues to be debated, of course. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The board has a limited scope to enact change at the social networking giant, meaning it can’t force Meta to make broader policy changes or address systemic issues. Notably, the Board isn’t consulted when CEO Mark Zuckerberg decides to make sweeping changes to the company’s policies — like its decision last year <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/01/13/meta-oversight-board-mark-zuckerberg-fact-checking-trump-michael-mcconnell/\">to relax hate speech restrictions.</a> The Board can make recommendations and can overturn specific content moderation decisions, but it can often be slow to render a decision. It also takes on relatively few cases compared to the millions of moderation decisions that Meta makes across its user base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/hcaCCyp4m4hA73gwUZf7Hxt1Op?domain=oversightboard.com/\">a report released in December,</a> Meta has implemented 75% of more than 300 recommendations the Board has issued, and its content moderation decisions have been consistently followed by Meta. Meta also recently asked <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/4MrzCzq8n8HOGz3ZHXhpH9QDTL?domain=oversightboard.com/\">for the policy advisors’ opinion</a> on its implementation of the crowdsourced fact-checking feature, Community Notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the Oversight Board issues its policy recommendations to Meta, the company has 60 days to respond. The Board is also soliciting public comments on this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: The public comments can be submitted anonymously; this post was updated after publication to reflect this.  </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Wingify co-founder Sparsh Gupta will lead the merged entity as CEO, while Everstone will remain the largest institutional shareholder.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal comes as digital experience tools, including those for A/B testing and personalization, are increasingly consolidating, as enterprises look to deploy AI across marketing, product and growth teams without stitching together multiple vendors. The merged company will invest more heavily in AI-led capabilities over time, while keeping customer experience unchanged in the near term and expanding the depth of its platform gradually, Gupta said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Everstone is injecting significant additional capital as part of the transaction, Gupta told TechCrunch, describing it as primarily aimed at “cleaning up” AB Tasty’s cap table and enabling the two businesses to come together under one platform. Financial terms were not disclosed, though Gupta indicated the deal includes a cash component alongside some equity rollover for existing leadership, allowing them to maintain ownership stakes in the new entity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupta framed the tie-up as a natural convergence between two long-time rivals. “Both the businesses have been operating as friendly competition,” he said, adding that the merger reflects growing demand from enterprises for more integrated, holistic digital experience platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The combined entity will be led by an executive team drawn from both organizations. Alongside Gupta as CEO, Wingify co-founder Ankit Jain will serve as Chief Product and Technology Officer, while AB Tasty’s co-founders will take on senior roles: Rémi Aubert will become Chief Customer and Strategy Officer and Alix de Sagazan will serve as Chief Revenue Officer, the companies said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg\" alt=\"Wingify and AB Tasty teams: Rémi Aubert, Sandeep Singh, Alix de Sagazan, Sprash Gupta, Ankit Jain\" class=\"wp-image-3083715\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Rémi Aubert, Sandeep Singh, Alix de Sagazan, Sparsh Gupta, and Ankit Jain (Left to Right)</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Wingify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both Wingify and AB Tasty are profitable, Gupta said, and the merger is focused on building out the combined platform rather than cost-cutting. “There’s no layoffs that are planned as part of this merger,” he added, describing the rationale as “value creation at this point in time.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The combined company will have close to 800 employees across 11 offices globally, with roughly 350 staff based outside India, Gupta said, adding that the merged entity will be headquartered in New Delhi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-founded in 2010 by Paras Chopra and Gupta, Wingify <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/wingify-launches-a-new-ab-testing-platform-for-people-without-coding-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">remained bootstrapped for more than a decade</a>, with VWO becoming its flagship product, helping businesses improve online conversion rates through A/B testing and customer experience optimization. Everstone acquired a majority stake in the startup in January 2025, which also marked a significant exit for Chopra, as TechCrunch reported earlier. That deal set the stage for Everstone’s platform-building strategy that has now led to the AB Tasty combination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wingify counts more than 3,000 brands as customers, including Forbes, Walt Disney, Amway, Hilton Vacations, TAP Portugal, and Cigna, across sectors such as e-commerce, SaaS, travel and media.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Paris, AB Tasty <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/ab-tasty-raises-40-million-to-optimize-e-commerce-user-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">provides experimentation and personalization software</a> used by more than 1,000 brands, including L’Oréal and Samsonite.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The combined company will compete in the same category as players such as Optimizely and Adobe, giving Singapore-headquartered Everstone and Wingify a larger footprint in Europe while deepening the merged platform’s product suite across testing, feature delivery, and AI-led personalization, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal adds to a growing wave of consolidation in marketing and product software, as private equity firms and strategic buyers look to assemble scaled, AI-ready platforms serving global enterprise customers. A recent PitchBook report shows enterprise SaaS M&amp;A surged to <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pe-is-fueling-the-surge-in-enterprise-saas-m-a-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">270 deals in Q3 worth $65 billion</a>, with deal volumes up 26.2% quarter-over-quarter, and private equity accounting for 66.7% of deals. More broadly, PwC last year <a href=\"https://www.pwc.dk/da/publikationer/2025/pwc-private-equity-trend-report-2025-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">flagged</a> [PDF] consolidation as a key value-creation strategy for private equity firms, and EY highlighted <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_in/insights/mergers-acquisitions/connecting-the-dots-m-a-deals-in-the-technology-services-in-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sustained private equity-led momentum in tech M&amp;A</a> in 2024 as buyers pursue platform scale and AI capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupta told TechCrunch that Everstone will retain majority control of the combined business and hold majority board rights following the transaction. The board will have five to six seats in total, including representation from Everstone and Gupta, alongside three to four independent directors, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Everstone said it will back the combined company with additional support, including an advisory board of industry experts and operators. “Together, VWO and AB Tasty will have among the most comprehensive product offerings in the category,” said Sandeep Singh, managing director at Everstone Capital.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Few are going to miss it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As industry watchers might remember, Facebook <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/\">rebranded</a> itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/\">Cambridge Analytica</a>; reports from Facebook whistleblower <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/\">Frances Haugen</a>, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/what-zuckerbergs-congressional-testimony-doesnt-say/\">spread of misinformation</a>; its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/you-dont-think-you-have-a-monopoly-read-sen-grahams-delightful-grilling-of-zuckerberg/\">monopolistic</a> practices, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/metas-horizon-worlds-is-available-in-the-us-and-canada-for-18-users/\">Meta’s Horizon Worlds</a> app and played games on their VR headsets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to CNBC, some of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/13/meta-lays-off-vr-employees-underscoring-zuckerbergs-pivot-to-ai.html\">casualties</a> include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.armature.com/games/resident-evil-4/\">Resident Evil 4 VR</a>“), Twisted Pixel (“<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twistedpixelgames.com/games/\">Marvel’s Deadpool VR</a>“), and Sanzaru (“<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sanzaru.com/games/asgards-wrath/\">Asgard’s Wrath</a>). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/meta-facebook-is-buying-within-creators-of-the-supernatural-vr-fitness-app/\">Meta acquired</a> in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/09/meta-acquires-within-despite-ftc-concerns/\">2023</a> for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-initiates-probe-into-metas-400-mln-vr-deal-supernatural-information-2021-12-17/\">$400 million</a>, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2026/meta-layoffs-hit-seattle-area-vr-studio-camouflaj-developer-behind-batman-game/\">by GeekWire</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And last week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/863209/meta-has-discontinued-its-metaverse-for-work-too\">The Verge</a> noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meta.com/help/quest/2464765133873078/\">is shutting down</a>, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/meta-reportedly-plans-to-slash-metaverse-budget-by-up-to-30/\">was slashing</a> the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/meta-is-pausing-its-dream-of-sharing-quests-horizon-os-with-third-party-headset-makers/\">pausing its program</a> to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/27/meta-facebook-q1-2022-earnings/\">lost</a> money at an excessive rate, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/03/metas-reality-labs-lost-13-7-billion-on-vr-and-ar-last-year/\">worrying</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/meta-revenue-decline-q3-2022-metaverse/\">investors</a>, and had never turned a profit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, the company had funneled some <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/employment/meta-makes-drastic-workforce-decision-after-73-billion-in-losses\">$73 billion</a> into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-building-in-the-open-fails\">“Building in the open” fails</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2023/growing-consumer-and-business-interest-in-the-metaverse-expected-to-fuel-trillion-dollar-opportunity-for-commerce-accenture-finds\">being</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/04/01/citi-metaverse-economy-13-trillion-2030/\">overhyped</a> by investors and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/value-creation-in-the-metaverse\">analysts</a> alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-memes/\">metaverse selfie</a> of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/19/mark-i-sure-hope-it-isnt/\">was so bad it even became a viral meme</a>. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Mark Zuckerberg avatar\" class=\"wp-image-2379511\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg 2148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=768,531 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=1200,829 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=1280,884 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=430,297 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=720,497 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=900,622 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=800,553 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=1536,1061 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=2048,1415 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=668,462 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=543,375 543w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=893,617 893w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=708,489 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology.

(Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/13/meta-plans-to-take-a-nearly-50percent-cut-on-nft-sales-in-its-metaverse.html\">a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets</a> within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself.

As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/04/meta-adds-personal-boundaries-to-horizon-worlds-and-venues-to-fight-harassment/\">rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature</a>, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/18/metaverse-new-venue-sexual-harassment-facebook\">experiencing</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60247542\">sexual harassment</a> in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/05/metaverse-sexual-assault-vr-game-online-safety-meta\">virtual rape</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/02/06/preventing-another-gang-rape-is-facebook-s-new-tool-enough-to-stop-sexual-assault-in-the-m\">gang rape</a> in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/14/meta-to-allow-horizon-worlds-users-to-turn-their-avatars-personal-safety-boundary-off-despite-virtual-world-sexual-assaults/\">later dialed back the safety feature a bit </a>by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2283968\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/code-of-conduct-for-virtual-experiences/\">a metaverse code of conduct</a> was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/metas-diversity-report-2022/\">reflect the makeup of Meta overall</a>, so it’s not a bad bet!)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ar-mixed-reality-and-ai-proved-more-popular\">AR, mixed reality, and AI proved more popular</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/ray-ban-meta-review/\">features</a> like the ability to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/10/the-near-joy-of-biking-with-ray-ban-meta-glasses/\">record hands-free</a>, stream music, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/ray-ban-meta-glasses-new-ai-features-and-partner-integrations/\">chat with Meta AI</a>, the glasses began to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/metas-smart-glasses-outsell-traditional-ray-bans-in-some-stores-even-before-ai-features-roll-out/\">outsell traditional Ray-Bans</a> in some retail stores in 2024.

According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user’s inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the agent’s mind, it’s doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/the-multi-billion-ai-security-problem-enterprises-cant-ignore/\">week’s episode of Equity</a>. “It’s trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meftah’s example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom’s AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2408.04667v5\">non-deterministic nature </a>of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Misaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic’s portfolio company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/witnessai-is-building-guardrails-for-generative-ai-models/\">Witness AI</a> is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Witness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI’s fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren’t going rogue, aren’t deleting files, aren’t doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-cybersecurity-become-ais-trillion-dollar-lisa-warren-p9evf/\">Lisa Warren predicts</a> that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As to how such startups plan to compete with big players like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-sagemaker-data-ai-governance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">AWS</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/new-enhanced-tool-governance-in-vertex-ai-agent-builder/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Google</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/ai-data-governance-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Salesforce</a> and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there’s room for many approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Caccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn’t easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat <em>them</em>?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For his part, Caccia doesn’t want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrikes-rivals-stand-to-benefit-from-its-update-fail-debacle/\">CrowdStrike did it in endpoint</a> [protection]. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/splunk-expands-machine-learning-capabilities-across-platform/\">Splunk</a> did it in SIEM. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/04/okta-plans-to-weave-ai-across-its-entire-identity-platform/\">Okta</a> did it in identity,” he said. “Someone comes through and stands next to the big guys…and we built Witness to do that from Day One.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He spent a lot of time in hospitals growing up, often traveling with his mother as she provided maternal care throughout the U.S.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After learning to code and studying computer science at UC Irvine, Bustami teamed up with Salman Khan, Chaskin Saroff, and Dr. Hisham Elgammal in 2021 to launch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/19/bioticsai-wants-to-improve-prenatal-ultrasound-scans-with-ai/\">BioticsAI.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The technology uses computer vision AI “to support fetal ultrasound quality assessment, anatomical completeness, automated reporting, and seamless integration into clinical workflows,” Bustami told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He hopes his tech will help the U.S. combat the fact that the U.S. has one of the worst prenatal outcomes for mothers <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/jun/insights-us-maternal-mortality-crisis-international-comparison\">among high-income nations.</a> Black women in particular face a very high rate of maternal deaths,  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bustami said that the prenatal ultrasound has become the “cornerstone” of monitoring pregnancies, but its low-quality images can lead to misdiagnosis. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bustami said the hardest part was not building his AI models, which were trained on a diverse set of hundreds of thousands of ultrasounds, but ensuring the tech performed reliably in the real world, especially on demographics with the highest risk for a tragic outcome. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In an environment where disparities in healthcare outcomes are well documented, it was critical to demonstrate consistent performance across patient subgroups, not just in idealized cases,” Bustami continued.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CEO said it took just under three years to go through the FDA process, including testing and validating the product. The experience taught him and his team how critical it is for engineering, product, clinical, and regulatory work to be tightly aligned from the very beginning. “By designing the product, clinical validation, and regulatory pathway together, rather than sequentially, we were able to move quickly,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now with FDA clearance, Bustami said the companies’ next focus is scaling across various health systems nationwide. He also has plans to add more features for fetal medicine and reproductive health. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re positioned to scale both distribution and clinical impact while continuing to deepen the power of our technology,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to correct the spelling of the co-founder’s name.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a move sure to turn heads in Silicon Valley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why? Because venture capital firms have historically avoided backing competing companies in the same sector, preferring to place their bets on a single winner. Yet here’s Sequoia, already invested in both OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, now throwing its weight behind Anthropic, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing is particularly surprising given what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said under oath last year. As part of OpenAI’s defense against a high-profile <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/musk-wants-up-to-134b-in-openai-lawsuit-despite-700b-fortune/\">lawsuit by Musk</a>, Altman addressed earlier rumors about restrictions in OpenAI’s 2024 funding round. While he denied that OpenAI investors were broadly prohibited from backing rivals, he did acknowledge that investors with ongoing access to OpenAI’s confidential information were told that access would be terminated “if they made non-passive investments in OpenAI’s competitors.” Altman called this “industry standard” protection (which it is) against misuse of competitively-sensitive information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the FT, Sequoia is joining a funding round led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, which are each contributing $1.5 billion. Anthropic is aiming to raise $25 billion or more at a $350 billion valuation — more than double its $170 billion valuation from just four months ago. The WSJ and Bloomberg had earlier reported the round at $10 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia have committed up to $15 billion combined, with VCs and other investors said to be contributing another $10 billion or more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Sequoia connection with Altman runs deep. When Altman dropped out of Stanford to start Loopt, Sequoia backed him. He later became a “scout” for Sequoia, introducing the firm to Stripe, which became one of the firm’s most valuable portfolio companies. Sequoia’s new co-leader Alfred Lin and Altman also appear comparatively close. Lin has interviewed Altman numerous times at Sequoia events, and when Altman was briefly ousted from OpenAI in November 2023, Lin publicly said he’d eagerly back Altman’s “next world-changing company.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Sequoia’s investment in xAI might seem to have already contradicted the traditional VC approach of picking winners, that bet is widely viewed as less about backing an OpenAI competitor and more about deepening the firm’s extensive ties to Elon Musk. Sequoia invested in X when Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it, is an investor in SpaceX and The Boring Company, and is a major backer of Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company. Former longtime Sequoia leader Michael Moritz was even an early investor in Musk’s X.com, which became part of PayPal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sequoia’s apparent reversal on portfolio conflicts is especially glaring given its historical stance. As we reported in 2020, the firm took the extraordinary step of walking away from its investment in payments company Finix after determining the startup competed with Stripe. Sequoia <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/sequoia-is-giving-away-21-million-to-a-payments-startup-it-funded-as-it-walks-away-from-deal/\">forfeited its $21 million investment</a>, letting Finix keep the money while giving up its board seat, information rights, and shares, marking the first time in the firm’s history it had severed ties with a newly funded company over a conflict of interest. (Sequoia had led Finix’s $35 million Series B round just months earlier.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reported Anthropic investment comes after dramatic leadership changes at Sequoia, where the firm’s global steward, Roelof Botha, was forced aside in a surprise vote this fall just <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38m7mp8bngg\">days after sitting down</a> with this editor at TechCrunch Disrupt, with Lin and Pat Grady — who’d led that Finix deal — taking over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is reportedly preparing for an IPO that could come as soon as this year.

As you might recall, the newsletter took a little holiday break. We’re back and well into 2026. And a lot has happened since the last edition. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I spent the first week of the year at the <strong>Consumer Electronics Show</strong> in Las Vegas. And while I wrote about this <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/ces-2025-where-have-all-the-us-automakers-gone/\">last January</a>, it’s worth repeating: U.S. automakers have left the building. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What has filled the void in the Las Vegas Convention Center? Autonomous vehicle tech companies (<strong>Zoox</strong>, <strong>Tensor Auto</strong>, <strong>Tier IV</strong>, and <strong>Waymo</strong>, which <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/waymo-is-rebranding-its-zeekr-robotaxi/\">rebranded its Zeekr RT</a>, to name a few), Chinese automakers like <strong>Geely</strong> and <strong>GWM</strong>, software and automotive chip companies, and loads of what <strong>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang</strong> calls “physical AI.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The term, which is sometimes called “embodied AI,” describes the use of AI outside the digital world and into the real, physics-based one. AI models, combined with sensors, cameras, and the motorized controls, allow that physical thing — humanoid robot, drone, autonomous forklift, robotaxi — to detect and understand what’s in this real environment and make decisions to operate within it. And it was all over the place from agriculture and robotics to autonomous vehicles and drones, industrial manufacturing, and wearables. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Hyundai</strong> had one of the busiest and largest exhibits with a near-constant line wrapped around the entrance. The Korean automaker wasn’t showing cars. Nope, it was robots of various forms, including the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/boston-dynamicss-next-gen-humanoid-robot-will-have-google-deepmind-dna/\">Atlas humanoid robot</a>, courtesy of its subsidiary <strong>Boston Dynamics</strong>. There were also innovations that have come out of <strong>Hyundai Motor Group Robotics LAB</strong>, including a robot that charges electric autonomous vehicles, and a four-wheel electric platform called the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobEd) that is going into production this year. It seems everyone was embracing and showcasing robotics, particularly humanoids. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hype around humanoids, specifically, and physical AI, in general, was palpable. I asked <strong>Mobileye </strong>co-founder and president <strong>Amnon Shashua</strong> about this because his company just bought his humanoid robotics startup for $900 million: “What do you say when people tell you humanoid robots are all hype?” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The internet was also a hype, remember in 2000, the crisis of the internet,” Shashua said. “It did not mean that [the] internet is not a real thing. Hype means that companies are overvalued for a certain period of time, and then they crash. It does not mean that the domain is not real. I believe that the domain of humanoids is real.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>A few notable stories from CES</strong>:<br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-launches-alpamayo-open-ai-models-that-allow-autonomous-vehicles-to-think-like-a-human/\">Nvidia launches Alpamayo, open AI models that allow autonomous vehicles to ‘think like a human’</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/this-is-ubers-new-robotaxi-from-lucid-and-nuro/\">This is Uber’s new robotaxi from Lucid and Nuro</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/mobileye-acquires-humanoid-robot-startup-mentee-robotics-for-900m/\">Mobileye acquires humanoid robot startup Mentee Robotics for $900M</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now onto the other non-CES and more recent news … </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">President Trump made comments this week at a Detroit Economic Club meeting about welcoming Chinese automakers into the United States that did not sit well with many in the auto industry, according to insiders I have spoken to. Specifically, I have been told the <strong>Alliance for Automotive Innovation</strong> (the industry lobbying group) is “freaking out,” one DC insider told me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great, I love that,” Trump said, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/an-trump-detroit-economic-club-0113/?utm_id=gfta-ur-260114&amp;share-code=A2NSPIE6XVCCTJYBY5MO54X5WI&amp;user_id=4532198&amp;customer_secondary_source=aac_articleGifting\">according to reporters</a> in attendance. “Let China come in, let Japan come in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A couple of notes. Japanese companies like <strong>Toyota</strong> are already very much in the United States. The bigger hurdle, beyond protests from within the boardrooms of U.S. automakers, is existing law. In 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule that <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bis.gov/connected-vehicles\">restricts the import and sale</a> of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia. This essentially bans the sale of Chinese vehicles in the country. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Avery Ash</strong>, who is CEO of <strong>SAFE</strong>, a nonpartisan organization focused on securing U.S. energy, critical materials, and supply chains, weighed in about the dangers of allowing Chinese automakers to sell their vehicles in the United States. Side note: Ash was on my podcast, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.autonocast.com/blog/2026/1/2/353-annual-prediction-episode-wsafe-ceo-avery-ash\">the Autonocast</a>, which touches on some of this subject.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Welcoming Chinese automakers to build cars here in the U.S. will reverse these hard-won accomplishments and put Americans at risk,” <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://secureenergy.org/statement-chineseautomanufacturing-reversehardwongains/\">he said</a>. ”We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere — it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Canada is opening the door to Chinese automakers. <strong>Canadian prime minister Mark Carney</strong> announced his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chinese-evs-inch-closer-to-the-us-as-canada-slashes-tariffs/\">Sean O’Kane reports</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">”<em>Got a tip for us to share in the Little Bird section?

Concern around the deepfake images has now prompted California’s attorney general <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to open an investigation</a> into Grok, following similar investigations by other regions, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy875j28k0o\">like the UK</a>, EU, India, Brazil, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mashable.com/article/countries-blocking-grok-for-explicit-deepfakes\">many more</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The drama on X also led social networking startup Bluesky <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/bluesky-rolls-out-cashtags-and-live-badges-amid-a-boost-in-app-installs/\">to see an increase</a> in app installs in recent days.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083472\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png 889w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=768,472 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=680,418 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=430,264 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=720,442 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=800,491 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=668,410 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=611,375 611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=708,435 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, Threads’ boost in daily mobile usage may be driven by other factors, including cross-promotions from Meta’s larger social apps like Facebook and Instagram (where Threads is regularly advertised to existing users), its focus on creators, and the rapid rollout of new features. Over the past year, Threads has added features like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/threads-takes-on-x-with-new-communities-feature/\">interest-based communities</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/threads-now-lets-you-approve-and-filter-your-replies/\">better filters</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/threads-gets-its-own-dms-as-app-distances-itself-from-instagram/\">DMs</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/threads-tests-a-way-to-share-long-form-text-on-the-platform/\">long-form text</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/threads-adds-ghost-posts-that-disappear-after-24-hours-and-responses-go-to-dms/\">disappearing posts</a>, and has recently been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/threads-is-developing-in-message-games/\">spotted testing games</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Combined, the daily active user increases suggest that more people are using Threads on mobile as a more regular habit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Meta’s official numbers, the tech giant said in August 2025 that Threads had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/threads-now-has-more-than-400-million-monthly-active-users/\">reached over 400 million monthly</a> active users. The company subsequently reported <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/threads-now-lets-you-approve-and-filter-your-replies/\">in October</a> of last year that Threads had 150 million daily active users.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The growth trends have been continuing for many months. Similarweb <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/threads-is-nearing-xs-daily-app-users-new-data-shows/\">last summer reported</a> that Threads was closing the gap with X on mobile devices after seeing 127.8% year-over-year growth as of late June 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relatedly, Similarweb observed that X is still ahead of Threads in the U.S., but the gap is narrowing. A year ago, X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. as it does now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Threads has little traction on the web while X maintains a fairly steady web audience with around 150 million daily web visits, according to Similarweb data. As of earlier this week (January 13), X was seeing 145.4 million daily web visits, while Threads saw 8.5 million daily web visits across Threads.com and Threads.net combined.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083471\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png 892w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=680,412 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=430,260 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=720,436 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=800,484 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=668,404 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=619,375 619w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=708,429 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The plan <em>had</em> been that each employee of YC-backed <a href=\"https://www.bucket.bot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bucket Robotics</a> would carry parts of their booth in their luggage to the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. But CEO and founder Matt Puchalski didn’t want to take the chance that one (or all) of their flights would be delayed. So he rented a Hyundai Santa Fe and packed it up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was… it was tight,” he said with a laugh on the show floor.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took 12 hours driving in the rain, but the gear – and Puchalski – made it safely to Las Vegas, and so began the young company’s first-ever CES.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">San Francisco-based Bucket Robotics was just one of thousands of companies exhibiting at the annual tech conference, a speck of sand on a beach full of products and promises. But despite its modest setup in the automotive-focused West Hall, Puchalski said the trip was worth it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of that was a willingness to be tireless, observant, and always ready to pitch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An engineer by trade, Puchalski spent most of the last decade working on autonomous vehicles at Uber, Argo AI, Ford’s subsidiary Latitude AI, and SoftBank-backed Stack AV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At those jobs, Puchalski developed deep connections in the automotive industry, and we crossed paths all week.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There he was at an industry networking party one night. On another night, in my hotel lobby at 10 p.m., he was debating how to balance quality and manufacturing yield with Sanjay Dastoor — founder of mobility startups Skip and Boosted, both of which also got off the ground at YC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But I first ran into Puchalski during breakfast at the hotel. Seated at the table next to me, he and sales associate Max Joseph were running through preparations for the conference’s “Media Day” over (allegedly) cage-free eggs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Puchalski’s verve piqued my interest, and after making an intro, he told me what Bucket Robotics is up to. Before I knew it, he had cracked open a bright yellow Pelican case and I was holding a small piece of plastic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Started as part of YC’s Spring 2024 batch, Bucket Robotics is all about using advanced vision systems to do quality inspections, specifically for surfaces. The goal is to automate a menial task that Puchalski joked is usually done by “dudes in Wisconsin,” and to accelerate the broad, multi-industry effort to onshore manufacturing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One example Puchalski offered was car door handles. It’s a part customers touch every day, so it needs to be structurally sound, and that kind of quality inspection is basically solved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it can be challenging to make sure the surface is flawless. Is the color right? Are there any burn or scuff marks? These are the questions Bucket Robotics wants to answer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s deeply hard to automate these types of challenges without huge volumes of data, so auto manufacturers just throw dudes in Wisconsin at this problem,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bucket Robotics solves that data problem by working from the CAD files for a particular part. It then generates a bunch of simulated defects – burn marks, bumps, breaks – so that its vision software can detect those problems quickly on a production line.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s no need for manual labeling, and the company claims its models can deploy “in minutes” while also adapting if products or production lines change. One of the big selling points to date is that Bucket Robotics can integrate into existing production lines without adding new hardware, Puchalski said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has already attracted customers in automotive and in defense, setting up Bucket Robotics to pursue the increasingly popular path of becoming a “dual-use” company.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the show floor opened, the first two hours were “intense,” Puchalski said. Attendees in suits snooped around the startup’s tables, plucked orange stickers with the Bucket Robotics logo, and quizzed the employees about their tech.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More importantly, Puchalski said the level of interest stayed consistent throughout the week. He had “real technical discussions” with people from the worlds of manufacturing, robotics, and automation. He said Friday that he’s spent the week since the show on follow-up calls with prospective customers and investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CES can be a slog, but Bucket Robotics survived. Now comes the actual hard part: building a business, scaling, fundraising, and striking commercial deals.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the “dudes in Wisconsin,” Puchalski doesn’t see his company as a threat to their livelihoods. Those jobs are just as much about spotting defects as they are about identifying the root cause of the problem, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And besides, Puchalski added, automating surface quality inspection is something that the manufacturing industry has been trying to do for decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So when we go to our customers, it’s incredibly exciting,” he said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s difficult to use one without sharing personal information, which is retained by the model’s parent company. With OpenAI <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/\">already testing advertising</a>, it’s easy to imagine the same data collection that fuels Facebook and Google creeping into your chatbot conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A new project, launched in December by Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike, is showing what a privacy-conscious AI service might look like. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://confer.to/\">Confer</a> is designed to look and feel like ChatGPT or Claude, but the backend is arranged to avoid data collection, with the open-source rigor that makes Signal so trusted. Your Confer conversations can’t be used to train the model or target ads, for the simple reason that the host will never have access to them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Marlinspike, those protections are a response to the intimate nature of the service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a form of technology that actively invites confession,” says Marlinspike. “Chat interfaces like ChatGPT know more about people than any other technology before. When you combine that with advertising, it’s like someone paying your therapist to convince you to buy something.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ensuring that privacy requires several different systems working in concert. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, Confer encrypts messages to and from the system using <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://confer.to/blog/2025/12/passkey-encryption/\">the WebAuthn passkey system</a>. (Unfortunately, that standard works best on mobile devices or Macs running Sequoia, although you can also make it work on Windows or Linux with a password manager.) <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://confer.to/blog/2026/01/private-inference/\">On the server side</a>, all Confer’s inference processing is done in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), with remote attestation systems in place to verify the system hasn’t been compromised. Inside that, there’s an array of open-weight foundation models handling whatever query comes in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is a lot more complicated than a standard inference setup (which is fairly complicated already), but it delivers on Confer’s basic promise to users. As long as those protections are in place, you can have sensitive conversations with the model without any information leaking out.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Confer’s free tier is limited to 20 messages a day and five active chats. Users willing to pay $35 a month will get unlimited access, along with more advanced models and personalization. That’s quite a bit more than ChatGPT’s Plus plan — but privacy doesn’t come cheap.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cabillionairetax.org/\">proposed wealth tax</a> would hit founders on their <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/01/16/business/fine-print-in-californias-wealth-tax-roils-silicon-valley/\">voting shares</a> rather than the actual equity they own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Take Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2026/01/17/leave-b-billionaire-tax-backlash-spreading-far-beyond-billionaires/\">The San Francisco Standard this week</a>. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the resistance is fierce and bipartisan.

Rather than robots doing the work as Bezos envisioned, Bruey said that within 15 to 20 years, it will be cheaper to send a “working-class human” to orbit for a month than to develop better machines.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the moment, few in the tech-forward audience seemed taken aback at what many might consider a provocative statement about cost savings. But that raised questions for me – and it has certainly raised questions for others – about who, exactly, will be working among the stars, and under what conditions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To explore these questions, I spoke this week with Mary-Jane Rubenstein, dean of social sciences and professor of religion and science and technology studies at Wesleyan University. Rubenstein is the author of the book <em>Worlds Without End: The Many Lives of the Multiverse</em>, which director Daniel Kwan used as research for the award-winning 2022 film “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” More recently, she’s been examining the ethics of space expansion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubenstein’s response to Bruey’s prediction cuts to a fundamental issue – which is power imbalance.”Workers already have a hard enough time on Earth paying their bills and keeping themselves safe . . . and insured,” she told me. “And that dependence on our employers only increases dramatically when one is dependent on one’s employer not just for a paycheck and sometimes for health care, but also for basic access, to food and to water – and also to air.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her assessment of space as a workplace was pretty direct. While it’s easy to romanticize space as an escape to a pristine frontier where people will float weightlessly among the stars, it’s worth remembering there are no oceans or mountains or chirpy birds in space. It’s “not nice up there,” said Rubenstein. “It is not nice at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But worker protections aren’t Rubenstein’s only concern. There’s also the increasingly contentious question of who owns what in space – a legal gray area that’s becoming more problematic as commercial space operations accelerate.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 1967 <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html\">Outer Space Treaty</a> established that no nation could claim sovereignty over celestial bodies. The moon, Mars, asteroids – these are supposed to belong to all of humanity. But in 2015, the U.S. passed the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which says that while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. Silicon Valley got starry-eyed almost immediately; the law opened the door to commercial exploitation of space resources, even as the rest of the world watched with concern.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubenstein offers an analogy: It’s like saying you can’t own a house, but you can own everything inside it. Actually, she corrects herself, saying it’s worse than that. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams. Because the stuff that is in the moon is the moon. There’s no difference between the stuff the moon contains and the moon itself.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Green light red light</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies have been positioning themselves to exploit this framework for some time. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/11/asteroid-mining-startup-astroforge-faces-setbacks-and-successes-on-demonstration-mission/\">AstroForge</a> is pursuing asteroid mining.  <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/the-not-so-secret-anymore-lunar-mining-startup/\">Interlune</a> wants to extract Helium-3 from the moon. The problem is that these aren’t renewable resources. “Once the U.S. takes [the Helium-3], China can’t get it,” says Rubenstein. “Once China takes it, the U.S. can’t get it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The international reaction to that 2015 act was swift. At the 2016 UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) meeting, Russia called the act a unilateral violation of international law. Belgium warned about global economic imbalances. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, the U.S. in 2020 created the Artemis Accords – bilateral agreements with allied nations that formalized the American interpretation of space law, particularly around resource extraction. Countries worried about being left out of the new space economy signed on. There are now 60 signatories, though notably Russia and China are not among them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is grumbling in the background, though. “This is one of those instances of the U.S. setting rules and then asking other people to join in or be left out,” Rubenstein says. The Accords don’t say resource extraction is explicitly legal – just that it doesn’t constitute the “national appropriation” that the Outer Space Treaty forbids. It’s a careful dance around a fraught issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her proposed solution to addressing it is straightforward if exceedingly unlikely: hand control back to the UN and COPUOS. In the absence of that, she suggests repealing the Wolf Amendment, a 2011 law that essentially bans NASA and other federal agencies from using federal funds to work with China or Chinese-owned companies without explicit FBI certification and Congressional approval. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When people tell Rubenstein that collaboration with China is impossible, she has a ready response: “We’re talking about an industry that is saying things like, ‘It’ll totally be possible to house thousands of people in a space hotel,’ or ‘It’ll be possible within 10 years to ship a million people to Mars, where there’s no air and where the radioactivity will give you cancer in a second and where your blood will boil and your face will fall off.’ If it’s possible to imagine doing those things, I think it is possible to imagine the U.S. talking to China.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubenstein’s broader concern is about what we’re choosing to do with space. She sees the current approach – turning the moon into what she calls “a cosmic gas station,” mining asteroids, establishing warfare capabilities in orbit – as profoundly misguided.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Science fiction has given us different templates for imagining space, she notes. She divides the genre into three broad categories. First, there’s the “conquest” genre, or stories written “in service of the expansion of a nation-state or the expansion of capital,” treating space as the next frontier to conquer, just as European explorers once viewed new continents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s dystopian science fiction, meant as warnings about destructive paths. But here’s where something odd happens: “Some tech companies seem to sort of miss the joke in this dystopian genre and just sort of actualize whatever the warning was,” she says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third strand uses space to imagine alternative societies with different ideas of justice and care –  what Rubenstein calls “speculative fiction” in a “high-tech key,” meaning they use futuristic technological settings as their framework.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it first became clear which template was dominating actual space development (fully in the conquest category), she got depressed. “This seemed to me a real missed opportunity for extending the values and priorities that we have in this world into those realms that we have previously reserved for thinking in different kinds of ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubenstein isn’t expecting dramatic policy shifts anytime soon, but she sees some realistic paths forward. One is tightening environmental regulations for space actors; as she notes, we’re only beginning to understand how rocket emissions and re-entering debris affect the ozone layer we spent decades repairing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A more promising opportunity, though, is space debris. With more than <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\">40,000 trackable objects</a> now circling Earth at 17,000 miles per hour, we’re approaching the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\">Kessler effect</a> – a runaway collision scenario that could make orbit unusable for any future launches. “Nobody wants that,” she says. “The U.S. government doesn’t want that. China doesn’t want it. The industry doesn’t want it.” It’s rare to find an issue where every stakeholder’s interests align perfectly, but “space garbage is bad for everybody,” she notes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She’s now working on a proposal for an annual conference bringing together academics, NASA representatives, and industry figures to discuss how to approach space “mindfully, ethically, collaboratively.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether anyone will listen is another question. There certainly doesn’t seem to be much motivation to come together on the issue. In fact, back in July of last year, Congress <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4360\">introduced legislation</a> to make the Wolf Amendment permanent, which would entrench restrictions on China cooperation rather than loosen them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the background, startup founders are projecting major changes in space within five to ten years, companies are positioning themselves to mine asteroids and the moon, and Bruey’s prediction about blue-collar workers in orbit hangs in the air, unanswered.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The judicial orders will allow three projects to resume construction: Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off — you guessed it — Virginia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The developers each filed lawsuits shortly after the Trump administration issued the stop work order, which had been effective for 90 days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When announcing the halt just days before Christmas, the government cited concerns the wind farms would interfere with radar operations. It’s a valid concern, and one the government and project developers grappled with throughout the siting and permitting process. Wind farms can be located to minimize disruption to existing radar facilities, and the radar equipment itself can be upgraded to filter out noise generated by whirling turbine blades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">President Trump himself has made it no secret that he’s not a fan of offshore wind: “I’m not much of a windmill person,” he told oil executives <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/01/09/trump-assails-windmills-and-wind-energy-as-junk-theyre-losers/88108694007/\">last week</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early hearings, judges weren’t impressed with the government’s line of reasoning. In three separate courtrooms in Virginia and Washington, DC, the Trump administration’s arguments were met with skepticism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, pointed out the government failed to address several of plaintiff Equinor’s arguments in its lawsuit. Equinor, which is developing Empire Wind, had alleged the Interior department’s order was “arbitrary and capricious.” “Your brief doesn’t even include the word arbitrary,” Nichols said, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-offshore-wind-energy-climate-lawsuits-370884367bf3c15556dee43495cf11d9\">according</a> to the Associated Press.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nichols also questioned why the Trump administration was asking for construction to be halted when its main concern regarding national security appeared to be over the operation of the wind farm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. District Judge Jamar Walker, who heard Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind developer Dominion Energy’s lawsuit, questioned the government along a similar line. He also said the Interior department’s order was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pilotonline.com/2026/01/16/dominion-wind-farm-judge-rules/\">overly broad</a> when viewed in context of the Virginia project.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two projects remain in limbo as their lawsuits work their way through the courts. Ørsted, which is developing Sunrise Wind, has a hearing scheduled for February 2, while Vineyard Wind 1’s developers only filed their lawsuit on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The East Coast could deliver up to 110 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2050, according to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-reports-chart-path-east-coast-offshore-wind-support-reliable-affordable-electricity\">Department of Energy study</a> published in 2024. That would provide a significant boost to some of the most densely populated cities — and data center regions — in the country. The Northeast currently has some of the highest electricity costs in the nation, while the Mid-Atlantic’s grid operator has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/trump-administration-wants-tech-companies-to-buy-15b-of-power-plants-they-may-not-use/\">recently come under fire</a> for rising electricity prices in its territory. Offshore wind, as one of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lazard.com/media/uounhon4/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2025.pdf\">cheapest forms</a> of new generating capacity, has the potential to slow or reverse the trend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potential is even bigger when viewed on a national scale. Offshore wind could generate <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/offshore-wind-research-and-development\">13,500 terawatt-hours</a> of electricity per year, which is three times more than the U.S. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/use-of-electricity.php\">currently consumes</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

She, like everyone else that has tried this challenge, was unsuccessful.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I realized half the reason that all of these attempts were failing is, number one, obviously it’s hard to make micro-robots survive on the ocean,” Laverack told TechCrunch. “But number two, they don’t have enough data on the ocean to know what the weather is or even know what the ocean conditions are like.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laverack set out for different conferences, like Oceanology International, to find this missing ocean data. She quickly realized that no one had really figured out a good way to collect it yet. Instead, she found people asking if they could pay her to try to collect the data herself. She figured that if people were willing to pay her for this data, she could try to build a way to capture it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those conversations were the basis for Oshen, which Laverack founded alongside Ciaran Dowds, an electrical engineer, in April 2022. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company now builds fleets of autonomous micro-robots, called C-Stars, that can survive in the ocean for 100 days straight and are deployed in swarms to collect ocean data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Oshen started small. Laverack said she and Dowds chose not to pursue venture capital right away when launching the company. Instead, they combined their savings to buy a 25-foot sailboat, lived at the cheapest marina in the United Kingdom, and used the vessel as their testing platform while getting the company off the ground.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For two years, Oshen would iterate on the bots on shore and immediately take them out on the water to test them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the summer, that’s not too bad,” Laverack said. “The problem is you really need your boats to work in all seasons. When your robot breaks, [and] it’s a winter storm that’s raging, a 25-foot sailboat shouldn’t really be going out in those conditions. So, that led to some adventure, which I wouldn’t say any more about, but there were certainly some interesting events there.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Getting the tech just right was difficult, Laverack said, because it’s not as easy as just taking an existing larger robot and shrinking it down. These bots needed to be mass deployable and cheap despite also needing to be technologically advanced enough to operate and collect data for long periods of time on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many other companies have successfully gotten two of the three correct, Laverack said. Oshen’s ability to get all three started to attract customers across defense and government organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company caught the attention of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) two years ago, but Laverack said that their tech just wasn’t ready to be deployed reliably yet. The organization reached back out two months before the 2025 hurricane season after Oshen had successfully deployed the robots into winter storms in the U.K. This time, Oshen jumped at the chance and quickly built and sent over 15 C-Stars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Five of these C-Stars were thrown overboard and made their way into position by the U.S. Virgin Islands where NOAA predicted Hurricane Humberto was headed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laverack said they were expecting the bots to just collect data leading up to the storm, but instead, three of the bots were able to weather the entire storm — minus a few missing parts — and collected data the whole time, becoming, she says, the first ocean robot to collect data through a Category 5 hurricane.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company has moved to a hub for marine tech companies in Plymouth, England, and has started racking up contracts with customers, including the U.K. government, for both weather and defense operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laverack said the company plans to raise venture capital soon to keep up with demand.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The figure comes from expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist whose bio says he has been deposed nearly 100 times and testified at trial more than a dozen times in complex commercial litigation cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wazzan, who specializes in valuation and damages calculations, determined that Musk is entitled to a hefty portion of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation when he co-founded the startup in 2015. (If you’re wondering, that would mean a 3,500-fold return on Musk’s investment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wazzan’s analysis combines Musk’s initial financial contributions with the technical know-how and business contributions he offered to OpenAI’s early team, calculating wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI and $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, which today owns a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/\">27% chunk</a> of the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s legal team argues he should be compensated as an early startup investor who sees returns “many orders of magnitude greater” than his initial investment. But the sheer scale of the damages demand underscores that this legal battle isn’t really about the money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s personal fortune currently hovers around $700 billion, making him by far the world’s richest person. As Reuters <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/elon-musk-becomes-first-person-worth-700-billion-after-court-ruling-pay-package-2025-12-20/\">recently noted</a>, his wealth now exceeds that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by a stunning $500 billion, according to Forbes’ billionaires list. In November, Tesla shareholders separately approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, the largest corporate pay package in history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Against this backdrop, even a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a relatively modest addition to Musk’s wealth, likely reinforcing for those at OpenAI their characterization of the lawsuit as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment” rather than a legitimate financial grievance. OpenAI already <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/15/openai-to-investors-expect-deliberately-outlandish-claims-from-musk.html\">reportedly sent a letter</a> Thursday to investors and others of its business partners, warning that Musk will make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the company heads to trial in April. The case will be heard in Oakland, Calif., about 15 miles east of San Francisco.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
