Sequoia partner Andrew Reed is joining the company’s board.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is now valued at $11 billion, more than three times its valuation in <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog/announcing-an-employee-tender\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its last round in January 2025</a>. Earlier in the year, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bb87485-7641-4577-8b64-144a1553d42e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Financial Times</a> reported that the startup was looking to raise at that valuation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that existing investor a16z quadrupled its investment amount, and Iconiq, which led the last round, tripled it. Some prior investors, like BroadLight, NFDG, Valor Capital, AMP Coalition, and Smash Capital, also joined the round. New investors for the funding included Lightspeed Venture Partners, Evantic<br>Capital, and Bond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ElevenLabs said that it will disclose some investors later in February, which might be strategic partners. The company has raised over $781 million to date. It said that it will use the funding for research and product development, along with expansion in international markets like India, Japan, Singapore, Brazil, and Mexico. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s co-founder, Mati Staniszewski, indicated that ElevenLabs might work on agents beyond voice and incorporate video. In January, the company announced <a href=\"https://ltx.studio/blog/ltx-audio-to-video-generation-with-elevenlabs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a partnership with LTX to produce audio-to-video content</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The intersection of models and products is critical – and our team has proven, time and again, how to translate research into real-world experiences. This funding helps us go beyond voice alone to transform how we interact with technology altogether. We plan to expand our Creative offering – helping creators combine our best-in-class audio with video and Agents – enabling businesses to build agents that can talk, type, and take action,” he said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has seen good growth momentum as it closed the year at $330 million ARR. In an interview with <a href=\"https://x.com/elevenlabsio/status/2010777303572242480?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> earlier this year, Staniszewski said that it took ElevenLabs five months to reach $200 million to $300 million in ARR.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Voice AI model providers are an attractive target for investors and big tech companies. In January, rival Deepgram raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/deepgram-raises-130m-at-1-3b-valuation-and-buys-a-yc-ai-startup/\">$130 million from AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation</a>. Meanwhile, Google hired <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/google-reportedly-snags-up-team-behind-ai-voice-startup-hume-ai/\">top talent from voice model company Hume AI</a>, including CEO Alan Cowen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Animate will continue to be available for both current and new customers, and we will ensure you continue to have access to your content,” the company <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/kb/maintenance-mode.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a post</a> on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe’s Monday announcement about discontinuing Animate was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1qu41ca/adobe_is_planning_to_discontinue_animate_next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">met</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=adobe%20animate&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with</a> incredulity, disappointment, and anger, and users aired concerns about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company changed its tune on Wednesday, saying there would no longer be a “deadline or date by which Animate will no longer be available.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Adobe Animate is in maintenance mode for all customers. This applies to individual, small business, and enterprise customers.  Maintenance mode means we will continue to support the application and provide ongoing security and bug fixes, but we are no longer adding new features. Animate will continue to be available for both new and existing users - we will not be discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate,” it said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One customer, <a href=\"https://x.com/TylerGlaiel/status/2018394595340771653\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posting on X</a>, had asked Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things <a href=\"https://x.com/ThisIsWronchi/status/2018404802510630914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like</a>, “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” <a href=\"https://x.com/Ari4472/status/2018406974589722819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and</a>, “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, the company updated its support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing that Adobe Animate would be discontinued on March 1, 2026. Enterprise customers would continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition, the company said at the time. Other customers would have support through March of next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/animate/kb/end-of-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FAQ</a>, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reading between the lines, it seemed as if Adobe was saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s surprising is that Adobe couldn’t even recommend software that would fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it said customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, it suggested that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction when no mention was made of Animate at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before switching to “maintenance mode,” Abode had intended for the software to continue to work for those who have it downloaded. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. Now, the company says it will be available to new users, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some users have been recommending other animation programs to use as a replacement, including <a href=\"https://moho.lostmarble.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Moho Animation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.toonboom.com/products/harmony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Toon Boom Harmony.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated, February 4, 2026, to note that Adobe reversed its decision and announced the software would be placed in maintenance mode instead of discontinued. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He often posts about the company’s autonomous ride-hailing efforts, and has a board seat at AV company Waabi — so the appointment may be a signal of the company’s plans to expand its driverless investments and operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, on the company’s Q4 earnings call on Wednesday, Krishnamurthy <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/407969754/files/doc_earnings/2025/q4/transcript/Uber-Q4-25-Prepared-Remarks.pdf\">said</a> the company would invest capital in its AV software partners, work with AV makers by investing equity or via offtake agreements, and “support our AV infrastructure partners.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With large and growing free cash flows, over the coming years we will invest with discipline across a multitude of opportunities, including positioning Uber to win in an AV future,” Krishnamurthy wrote in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/fcda6930-c9b5-4ab5-bb64-9b621c2ca8a5.pdf\">statement</a> detailing the company’s Q4 results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on the call that he was convinced autonomous vehicles would “unlock a multi-trillion dollar opportunity,” for the company, adding that autonomy “fundamentally amplifies” the strengths of the company’s platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By the end of 2026, we expect to be facilitating AV trips in as many as 15 cities globally, with a roughly even split of U.S. and international cities. And by 2029, we intend to be the largest facilitator of AV trips in the world,” Khosrowshahi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber said revenue rose to $14.37 billion in the fourth quarter, up 20% from a year earlier, driven by strong demand for its food delivery services. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mahendra-Rajah is leaving Uber after three years at the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The duo decided to break out on their own and, earlier this year, launched their firm to back digital marketplaces. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It felt like the timing was right and there was support within the firm to go do this,” Nagar said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vision is that there is still so much to digitize, like in supply chain and construction, and this is the moment to strike because even holdout industries are more comfortable adopting new technology as fintech architecture advances. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you look at the biggest venture wins over the last decade,” she said, pointing to the likes of Uber, Instacart, and Airbnb, “those are five of the top 10 outcomes in venture.” As in those companies that raised billions from investors, went on to IPO, and returned millions to them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of those wins were in consumer, which tends to be faster-moving than large enterprises,” Nagar continued. “We think there’s a ton of white space to double down and focus on B2B marketplaces.” Looking specifically for the categories that haven’t yet digitized. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm has already invested in six companies, including BigRentals and Repackify, focused on equipment rental and packaging logistics, respectively. Nagar said the firm hopes to overall write seed checks into at least 20 companies, at $1 million to $2 million a pop. She said they hope to deploy the entire fund within the next 3 to 4 years. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though many new funds are struggling to raise capital (and capital remains concentrated at the top), Nagar said she and Koopersmith were able to lean on their backgrounds when wooing LPs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nagar previously helped launch Amazon apparel back in 2009 and was head of mobile at RetailMeNot. Koopersmith, meanwhile, spent 20 years at Pritzker Group and serves on the board of various marketplace companies. At the same time, Nagar said that without Pritzker’s support, it would have been quite hard to raise this fund, especially in last year’s environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other LPs in their fund include the State of Illinois Growth and Innovation Fund and executives from other marketplace companies, like Favor Delivery and RetailMeNot. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nagar said the firm is also location-agnostic, recognizing that the still-hidden marketplaces may not be found only in Silicon Valley and New York City. “We’re finding these overlooked founders in places where maybe other funds aren’t looking,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SNAK is itself based in Chicago, which she said some LPs have questioned. “People perceive that as a disadvantage; we view it as an advantage,” she continued. “We can get to everybody very fast.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Amazon has not yet shared user adoption numbers on this more “agentic” use case (where the AI acts autonomously to complete tasks) for the AI helper.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During its year-long beta testing period, Alexa customers had the option to try the AI feature or roll back to the prior version. The company tells TechCrunch the option to revert to the old Alexa will continue to be available, but couldn’t say for how long. Likely, Amazon wants a bit more time to improve the AI experience before making it a requirement for users. The percentage of those opting out is also a key metric to track, but Rausch notes that the figure is in the low single digits, suggesting that most customers are not so unhappy with Alexa+ that they’re giving up. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?w=680\" alt=\"Alexa.com\" class=\"wp-image-3079553\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Amazon has had to work to resolve bugs and address user feedback ahead of this launch. Some beta testers complained that Alexa+ was too chatty, or interrupted at the wrong times, for instance. Others complained about Alexa’s new voice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon has taken in this feedback and made changes over time. For instance, the company revised the onboarding experience to have Alexa explain how to change her voice, as some preferred Alexa’s “OG” voice. (That voice is still available as Alexa+ voice No. 2, but it now uses AI to add more inflection.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Eventually, we had her use her new version of her old voice, and then switch back again, just to show customers,” says Rausch, describing the changes the team made to onboarding. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another example, Amazon tried to make Alexa less prone to unwanted interruptions. Now, Alexa will ask, “Is that for me?” when the AI is unsure who is being addressed. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?w=335\" alt=\"Alexa app\" class=\"wp-image-3079554\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=768,1560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=335,680 335w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=591,1200 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=630,1280 630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=212,430 212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=354,720 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=443,900 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=394,800 394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=756,1536 756w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=1008,2048 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=329,668 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=185,375 185w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=304,617 304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=261,531 261w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot of the new Alexa app</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rausch points out that the overall experience is configurable, too. If customers don’t want the follow-on mode, for instance — which allows Alexa to continue listening after responding — they can turn it off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked if users will be able to change the AI assistant’s personality, as in other AI chatbots, where the AI can be set to be personal, professional, quirky, nerdy, and more,  Rausch says simply, “Stay tuned.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the beta, Amazon reported positive adoption trends in terms of both usage and engagement, with few customers opting for rollbacks. Music streams increased by 25% after customers upgraded to Alexa+, and more customers are engaging deeply with recipes, a feature that has seen 5x growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, customers are having 2 to 3 times more conversations with Alexa+, compared with the original Alexa. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Alexa+ will be free to U.S. Prime members, non-Prime customers could opt to pay $19.99/month for standalone access — a price that’s comparable to something like ChatGPT Plus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon notes the free experience on web and mobile will have some limits, but these are mainly in place to protect against abuse. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we’ve got some great, generous limits. We’re not talking about exactly what they are today, but…there are some [limits],” Rausch says. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Alexa+ experience in the U.S. will be available across Alexa devices, including Echo products, Fire TV, Alexa.com, the Alexa mobile app, and Alexa-enabled devices from partners including Samsung, Bose, and others, with more to come. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most of what we know about the ocean just skims the surface, literally. We’ve gathered a large quantity of data on the oceans from satellites, but most of that is based on the top layer of water. Below that, the picture gets murkier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Buoys, ships, and some autonomous rovers have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://research.noaa.gov/noaa-collects-a-lot-of-data-on-the-ocean-here-are-4-ways-we-use-it/\">recently added</a> some detail, but it’s nothing like what we get from satellites today. It’s frustrating to everyone from fishermen to the Coast Guard, meteorologists to offshore wind developers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Getting data from the subsurface ocean has always been really hard,” Ravi Pappu, founder and CEO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.apeironlabs.com/\">Apeiron Labs</a>, told TechCrunch. “It’s really slow. You need a ship that costs $100,000 a day, [and] steams out slowly. Everything’s an expedition.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pappu hopes that his bobbing, autonomous underwater vehicle can change that. He founded Apeiron Labs in 2022 after a stint as CTO of In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. There, the lack of data on the ocean was “a persistent problem” that kept coming up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To fill the gaps, Apeiron Labs is building low-cost vehicles that travel 400 meters up and down the water column (the vertical section of ocean from surface to seafloor), sampling temperature, salinity, and acoustics once or twice per day. Apeiron currently sells to both civilian and defense customers, Pappu said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To build and sell more of its autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), Apeiron Labs recently closed a $9.5 million Series A round led by Dyne Ventures, RA Capital Management Planetary Health and S2G Investments, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Assembly Ventures, Bay Bridge Ventures, and TFX Capital participated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At three feet long, five inches in diameter, and just over 20 pounds, the startup’s AUVs can be deployed from boats or airplanes. Not coincidentally, they also fit into the U.S. Navy’s existing launch equipment. Once the AUV hits the water, it gets its bearings and connects to a cloud-based operating system, where it logs its data. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it dives, the operating system uses models of the ocean to predict where it will surface. When the AUV finally breaches and reconnects with the operating system, the cloud-based software incorporates the new data to refine its models. The AUVs are spaced about 10 km to 20 km apart (6.2 miles to 12.4 miles), forming a line or array that captures data in greater resolution than ship-based efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apeiron envisions deploying dozens or hundreds of its AUVs for a range of customers. The Pentagon might use them to listen for submarines off the coast of the U.S., while fisheries might want to receive more detailed temperature and salinity data about prime fishing waters. The goal is persistent monitoring in key parts of the ocean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pappu said that at Apeiron’s current scale, it has brought the cost of ocean data down by 100-fold. He wants to get it down by a factor of 1,000, and he thinks Apeiron can hit that target next year. Referencing a type of small, low-cost satellite, Pappu adds: “We think of ourselves as the CubeSat for the ocean.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update 10 am ET: The headline has been updated to reflect that Apeiron raised $9.5 million, not $29 million.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The fresh funding also included participation from WillowTree Ventures and MVP Ventures, alongside Fortune 100 operators joining as angel investors and advisors, bringing the startup’s total funding to $7.5 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For large companies, the gap between increasingly personalized ads and largely generic website experiences has traditionally been filled by a mix of personalization software, engineering teams, and marketing agencies — a model that is slow, expensive, and difficult to scale. While ads can be tailored instantly for different audiences, changing what happens once a visitor lands on a site often requires weeks of coordination and limits teams to running only a handful of experiments each year. Fibr AI argues that this human-heavy operating model no longer works. Instead, the startup uses autonomous AI agents to infer intent, generate variations, and continuously optimize pages in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fibr AI replaces the agency- and engineering-heavy model with autonomous systems that operate continuously, Ankur Goyal (pictured above, right), the co-founder and chief executive, said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are [the] software, and the agency is the workforce of agents we are deploying,” Goyal told TechCrunch, adding that this allows Fibr AI to run thousands of experiments in parallel rather than a few dozen each year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adoption was initially slow. Founded in early 2023 by Goyal and Pritam Roy (pictured above, left), Fibr AI had just one or two customers for much of its first two years as enterprises took time to evaluate the approach. That began to change last year, Goyal said, with adoption picking up among large U.S. companies, including banks and healthcare providers, bringing the total number of customers to 12.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are an infra afterthought layer,” Goyal told TechCrunch. “Once it’s set up, nobody wants to think about it again.” That dynamic, he added, has led Fibr AI to sign three- to five-year contracts with large enterprises, which tend to treat website infrastructure as something to standardize rather than continuously revisit.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At a technical level, Fibr AI operates as a layer on top of an existing website, connecting to a company’s advertising, analytics, and customer data systems to understand how visitors arrive and what they are likely looking for. Its AI agents then assemble and adjust page content, such as copy, imagery, and layout, treating each URL as a system that learns and optimizes continuously rather than a fixed page. Instead of relying on manually configured rules or sequential A/B tests, the platform runs large numbers of micro-experiments in parallel and updates experiences systematically as traffic flows in from different channels.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089322\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Fibr AI personalizes webpages using AI agents</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Fibr AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That shift has direct cost implications for large enterprises. Traditional website personalization typically combines software licenses with agency retainers and engineering time, tying costs to people rather than outcomes. Goyal said enterprises are increasingly evaluating Fibr AI’s platform based on cost per experiment and conversion impact, rather than the number of tools or people involved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Accel, that operating model — rather than the AI buzz — was central to the decision to invest again. “Advertising today is one-to-one, but when users land on a website it becomes one-to-many,” said Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel. “You can create hundreds of ads for different audiences, but they all still land on the same page.” Fibr’s ability to turn that dynamic into one-to-one personalization, he said, stood out because it removed the agency and engineering bottlenecks that typically limit how far enterprises can push experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop added that early enterprise adoption, particularly among banks and healthcare companies, helped validate the thesis. “These are regulated, conservative industries,” he said. “When they start saying, ‘We need this, and we’re willing to pay for it,’ that’s when we feel confident doubling down.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-future-proofing-for-the-agentic-commerce-era\">Future-proofing for the agentic-commerce era</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While most of Fibr AI’s business today is driven by personalizing experiences for human visitors, Accel and Fibr AI also see potential in how AI agents are beginning to mediate online discovery. As users increasingly research, compare, and shortlist products using large language models and AI chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, before visiting a website, Swaroop said, the ability for sites to adapt based on what a visitor — or an AI system acting on their behalf — already knows could become more important over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That part is still early,” Swaroop said, “but the companies building for today’s needs while being ready for that shift tomorrow are the ones we want to back.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089266\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg 1298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=768,582 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=680,516 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=1200,910 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=1280,970 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=430,326 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=720,546 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=900,682 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=800,606 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=668,506 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=495,375 495w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=814,617 814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=700,531 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1298px) 100vw, 1298px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Fibr AI’s dynamic experience for discovery through LLMs and AI chatbots</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Fibr AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new funding, Fibr AI plans to focus on expanding its sales and customer-facing teams in the U.S., while continuing to build out its technical base in India.

But both Goyal and Swaroop argued that those platforms are constrained by how they are built and sold, typically relying on marketing agencies and engineering teams to configure and operate them. That model, they said, makes it difficult to move quickly or scale experimentation, even as customer acquisition and messaging have become increasingly dynamic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Incumbents have been slow in bringing out products,” Swaroop said, adding that even when new features arrive, they often come years after demand has shifted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That began with Spotify trying <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/spotify-is-quietly-moves-lyrics-behind-a-paywall/\">to paywall lyrics </a>in 2024, before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/spotify-expands-monthly-limit-lyrics-free-users/\">loosening its grip</a> later in the year after numerous complaints. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company hopes that the new offline lyrics feature — which will only be offered to Premium subscribers — could encourage users to upgrade.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089310\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lyric-Previews.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the new experience, lyrics will also be relocated so they appear directly beneath the album artwork or the short, looping video that plays alongside the music. Spotify says it chose to move lyrics to this more prominent position after user tests suggested it increased engagement with the feature. (It’s still possible to share favorite lyrics snippets to social media from the Now Playing View, the company noted.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This feature, which Spotify called lyric previews, will roll out globally to both free and paid customers on the iOS and Android apps for smartphones and tablets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, lyrics translations, which were first introduced in 2022, will now be globally available. That’s an expansion from the 25 markets supported last year. When translations are available, you can tap the translate icon on the lyrics card to see the translation appear beneath the original lyrics. The translation will default to whatever your device’s language is set to, Spotify says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In past years, Spotify had been slow to roll out lyrics across its app, largely due to licensing issues. After years of consumer demand for the feature, the company finally rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/\">real-time lyrics to global users </a>in 2021 after a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/in-a-significant-expansion-spotify-to-launch-real-time-lyrics-in-26-markets/\">smaller launch</a> in a couple of dozen markets the year prior, and tests that spanned back to 2019. Before this, Spotify had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/12/spotify-teams-with-genius-to-annotate-music-tracks/\">partnered</a> with Genius for a “behind the lyrics” feature, which combined partial lyrics with song trivia.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The outfit plans to use the capital to speed up deployment of its high-speed memory chips, a critical component for the chips used for AI workloads, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round, which brought Positron to a $1 billion valuation, was co-led by Arena Private Wealth, Jump Trading, and Unless, with strategic investment from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which has been increasingly focused on building out AI infrastructure, the sources said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Reno-based startup’s Series B comes as hyperscalers and AI firms push to reduce their reliance on longstanding leader Nvidia. These firms include OpenAI, which, despite being one of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers, is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-is-unsatisfied-with-some-nvidia-chips-looking-alternatives-sources-say-2026-02-02/\">reportedly</a> unsatisfied with some of the firm’s latest AI chips and has been seeking alternatives since last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Qatar, through QIA, has been accelerating a broader push into so-called “sovereign” AI infrastructure – a priority repeatedly underscored at Web Summit Qatar in Doha this week. Several sources told TechCrunch the country views compute capacity as critical to staying competitive on the global economic stage, and is positioning itself as a leading AI services hub in the Middle East, fueling interest in startups like Positron. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The strategy is already taking shape through major commitments, including a $20 billion AI infrastructure <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.qia.qa/en/Newsroom/Pages/Brookfield-and-Qai-Form-$20-Billion-Strategic-Investment-Partnership-for-AI-Infrastructure.aspx\">joint venture with Brookfield Asset Management</a> that was announced in December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Positron’s fundraise brings the three-year-old startup’s total capital raised to just over $300 million. The startup previously raised $75 million last year from investors including Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, DFJ Growth, Flume Ventures and Resilience Reserve. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims its first-generation chip, Atlas, manufactured in Arizona, can match the performance of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for less than a third of the power. Positron is focused on inference – computing needed to run AI models for real-world applications – rather than training large language models, positioning the company well as demand surges for inference hardware as businesses increasingly shift focus from building large models to deploying them at scale.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the funding, Positron aims to accelerate its roadmap to ship its next-generation Asimov silicon chip, targeting production in early 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sources tell TechCrunch that beyond its memory capabilities, Positron’s chips also perform strongly in high-frequency and video-processing workloads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Positron for more information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to include updates from Positron about co-lead investors and valuation. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the date of QIA’s partnership with Brookfield. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Attia served on the executive team of the food startup and was also an <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250529749264/en/David-Closes-%2475-Million-Series-A-Funding-Round\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">early investor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For those unfamiliar, Attia is a Canadian American physician who has become one of the most prominent voices in longevity and preventive health. He’s best known for his bestselling book “Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity” and his now seven-year-old podcast, wherein he explores optimization strategies. He was also hired just last month as a contributor to CBS.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three-year-old, New York-based David Protein raised a $75 million Series A funding round in May of last year led by Greenoaks, with participation from Valor Equity Partners. The company has experienced significant growth since launching its flagship protein bar in September 2024, a product it describes as having 28 grams of protein, zero sugar, and 150 calories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a lengthy <a href=\"https://x.com/PeterAttiaMD/status/2018350892395774116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on X</a>, Attia wrote that he was “ashamed” of some of the crude content in his emails with Epstein, but he also said he was not involved in criminal activity and never visited Epstein’s island or traveled on his plane. Attia also discussed at length how he came to know Epstein and why he stayed involved with him even after Epstein’s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5478620/jeffrey-epstein-crimes-timeline-legal-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2008 conviction</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fallout appears to extend beyond David Protein. It also appears that Biograph, the healthcare testing and longevity startup that Attia co-founded with entrepreneur John Hering, may be distancing itself from the physician. The company declined to comment on Attia’s ongoing participation with the startup or about the pages on its website that used to mention him but now omit his name or return a “file not found” error.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Biograph came out of stealth a year ago, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/28/startup-co-founded-by-longevity-guru-peter-attia-emerges-from-stealth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch previously reported</a>, with backing from investors that include Vy Capital, Human Capital, Alpha Wave, and WndrCo, along with angel investors, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/19/former-a16z-vc-balaji-srinivasan-obtained-a-private-island-for-his-new-longevity-technocapitalist-school/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Balaji Srinivasan</a>.

Founded in 2022, Varaha has raised about $33 million in equity to date, alongside $35 million in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/kering-backed-fund-mirova-pours-30-5m-into-indias-varaha-for-regenerative-farming-push/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">project financing</a> and $500,000 in grants, as it builds carbon removal projects across Asia and Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has emerged as an increasingly important base for carbon removal projects, offering lower operating costs, deep agricultural supply chains, and a large pool of technical talent as corporate demand for verified removals rises, including from companies facing growing energy use from data centers and AI workloads. Varaha is positioning itself to capitalize on those advantages, arguing that its execution-focused model allows it to deliver carbon removal at lower cost while meeting the same international verification standards as higher-priced competitors in Europe and North America.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varaha’s advantage lies less in proprietary technology and more in execution, said co-founder and chief executive Madhur Jain in an interview, arguing that high operating costs could become a constraint for carbon removal developers in wealthier markets as prices come under pressure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If carbon credit is a cost to the businesses that are buying these carbon credits … it’s a cost on their balance sheet. It’s not a CSR item,” Jain told TechCrunch. “And hence, if the cost of a certain geography is going to be so high by an order of magnitude of like, 1.5x to 3x credit production, it is going to be extremely hard for those companies to survive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varaha develops carbon removal projects across four main pathways: regenerative agriculture, agroforestry, biochar, and enhanced rock weathering, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/varaha-india-carbon-credits-farmers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">working largely with smallholder farmers</a> and industrial partners in emerging markets. The startup generates and sells verified carbon removal credits through international registries, including Puro.earth, Isometric, Verra, Gold Standard, and Switzerland-based Carbon Standards International, positioning itself as a supplier to global corporations seeking durable and independently validated emissions reductions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089092\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">One of Varaha’s Regenerative agriculture projects</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Varaha</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To date, Varaha has removed more than 2 million tons of carbon dioxide across 14 active projects, generating around 150,000 carbon removal credits, Jain said.

It’s part of a grassroots effort, across race and class, that is seeing people speak out, donate money, protest, and offer emotional support to one another. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a lot of commonality between how a teacher is reacting right now and how a tech professional is reacting,” Scott Burns, an investor in the area, told TechCrunch. He said people are “very fatigued.” Burns is going to church more often to help pack food to deliver to those too frightened to leave their homes. “It was like what happens after a natural disaster,” he said of the effort. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Burns and other members of the Minneapolis tech industry told TechCrunch that the immigration raids have been very disruptive to their lives, describing a city that has seen itself united in the last several weeks in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2026/ice-surveillance-immigrants-protesters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">face of escalating violence</a> from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How can building a company remain a focal point when ICE agents appear to be everywhere, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn0w129lqo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plainclothed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/ice-agent-weapons-minneapolis.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">armed with military-grade weapons</a>?

He is a U.S. citizen but has seen people of color throughout the city profiled and picked up by ICE and border patrol agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People aren’t exaggerating how hard it has been.

Cars will beep. Protestors whistle alerts. “And if you miss it, you’ll see signs saying, ‘My neighbor was taken by ICE.’” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Officials even perform “citizen checks,” stopping people and asking them to prove immigration status — which the Supreme Court said last year can be done <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/ice-race-ethnicity-immigration.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">based on details like race</a> or if a person has an “accent.” These checks have been conducted on people performing even mundane tasks, Torres said, like snow-blowing the lawn. He said he’s had a few run-ins himself with ICE, which is why he likes to stay low. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The line separating me from being a victim of assault is just a chance encounter,” he said, adding that he knew people who were followed by ICE — something others have reported is happening alongside raids. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration has escalated its immigration raids throughout the country, though the force deployed in the Twin Cities is especially large, with <a href=\"https://www.fox9.com/news/ice-minnesota-how-many-feds-minnesota\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 3,000 federal agents</a> deployed to Minnesota as part of the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge.” ICE and border patrol agents now outnumber local police in Minneapolis almost 3 to 1, Senator <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5705426-ice-agents-outnumber-minneapolis-police-klobuchar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amy Klobuchar</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5705426-ice-agents-outnumber-minneapolis-police-klobuchar/\">of Minnesota has said</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The state is home to one of the largest populations of immigrants from Somalia, a group the administration has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2026/jan/28/political-thunderstorm-inside-trumps-attacks-on-the-somali-community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">targeted before</a>.

He, too, is a U.S. citizen and can trace his roots in the country back for a century. Still, living just outside the city, he carries his passport with him just in case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where I go to the gym, they’re in rural Minnesota,” he said, meaning agents aren’t only in the city. “It’s just been a strange time.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089255\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A demonstrator holding a sign that reads “Stop Minnesota Massacre” while joining a protest.

This investor, for example, works with founders in college, many of whom are immigrants. He buys them food so they don’t have to risk going to the grocery store themselves. He also tries to work from home, when possible, as do many of the other people TechCrunch spoke with. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a tense and difficult time on the ground,” Mary Grove, another investor in the area, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investor Reed Robinson, who has also been helping community members financially, said some of his founders with children have created a volunteer system to watch each other’s kids at school or daycare. It’s so common for ICE to detain the daycare staff, he said, adding that ICE agents <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/ice-violations-judge-statement-twin-cities-texas-immigration/\">frequently violate the law</a> and court orders.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It feels unnecessary, it feels intrusive, it feels like a violation of rights,” Robinson said about the immigration operation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Robinson, many people feel anger beneath the unease and fear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The emotional toll makes it hard to build, investors and founders said. Torres, for example, said his company now has a no-ride-sharing-app policy. Some of his engineers are on H-1B visas <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/startup-founders-say-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-is-a-talent-tariff-that-will-hurt-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(which the Trump administration has also attacked)</a> and have reported being followed by immigration officials.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Each time, it was three to four armed men in tactical outfits,” Torres said, adding that he and his wife have spoken about fleeing the state. “They’re inflicting trauma everywhere they go.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-grassroots-efforts-prevail-as-corporate-leaders-disappoint\">Grassroots efforts prevail as corporate leaders disappoint</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Minneapolis <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/09/minneapolis-investors-mary-grove-justin-kaufenberg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tech scene is still quite small</a>, with companies raising just <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-companies-startups-raise-venture-capital-funding-investor/600334061\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over $1 billion in the past few years</a>. There are some notable companies in the ecosystem, such as the fintech Sezzle (now public), the clean water company Rorra, and the medtech Reema. There is an incredible history of innovation, Robinson said. “It’s not going to stop; we’re going to continue to do the work while we figure out this current situation.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Twin Cities — Minneapolis and St. Paul — are the headquarters of some of the biggest American companies, such as Target, Optum, Best Buy, UnitedHealthGroup, and General Mills, to name a few. Some founders and investors criticized the leadership of these big companies, mainly for their vague responses to the chaos gripping the cities, even <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/businesses-face-pressure-respond-immigration-enforcement-becoming-target-129567788\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as many of their own employees are detained</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We haven’t had an adequate response,” one startup investor said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sixty top executives from the state <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/business/minnesota-target-general-mills-ceo-letter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed a statement</a> that called for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” after ICE agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti.

Eighteen percent were worried about “backlash from the Trump administration,” while 9% said they were still figuring out how to respond. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you see the failure of community institutions to demonstrate any kind of bravery, that’s really where it’s probably most disappointing,” Tim Herby, a local investor, told TechCrunch, calling the past two months heart-wrenching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grove, the investor, said her team routinely checks in with others in the community, including her portfolio companies, to ensure they are doing well. She said people are helping each other pay rent, while restaurants are offering free meals.

It’s a new day-to-day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another Black founder, meanwhile, said some of his white friends have started to drive him around the city for safety. He recalls one day sitting in a restaurant chatting with friends, when the television started giving live updates of <a href=\"https://sahanjournal.com/public-safety/north-minneapolis-ice-shooting-report-immigration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ICE shooting another person</a>. The mood fell somber, a reminder of how these raids have consumed every moment of life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I saw a friend yesterday,” he said. “It was the first time he left the house since New Year’s.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Department of Homeland Security has been quietly demanding tech companies turn over user information about critics of the Trump administration, according to reports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In several cases over recent months, Homeland Security has relied on the use of administrative subpoenas to seek identifiable information about individuals who run anonymous Instagram accounts, which share posts about ICE immigration raids in their local neighborhoods. These subpoenas have also been used to demand information about people who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike judicial subpoenas, which are authorized by a judge after seeing enough evidence of a crime to authorize a search or seizure of someone’s things, administrative subpoenas are issued by federal agencies, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals from tech and phone companies without a judge’s oversight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While administrative subpoenas cannot be used to obtain the contents of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/reverse-searches-police-tap-tech-companies-private-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">person’s emails, online searches, or location data</a>, they can demand information specifically about the user, such as what time a user logs in, from where, using which devices, and revealing the email addresses and other identifiable information about who opened an online account. But because administrative subpoenas are not backed by a judge’s authority or a court’s order, it’s largely up to a company whether to give over any data to the requesting government agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Administrative subpoenas are not new; the use of these self-signed demands by Trump officials to seek identifiable information about people who are critical of the president’s policies has raised alarm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-28/dhs-tried-novel-argument-to-compel-meta-to-provide-user-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported last week</a> that Homeland Security sought the identity of an anonymous Instagram account called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/montcowatch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">@montocowatch</a>, which says its goal is to share resources to help protect immigrant rights and due process across Montgomery County in Pennsylvania. This comes amid an ongoing federal immigration crackdown across the United States, which has drawn widespread protests and condemnation. Homeland Security lawyers sent an administrative subpoena to Meta demanding it turn over personal information of the person who runs the account, citing a non-Homeland Security employee who claimed to receive a tip that ICE agents were being stalked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the account owner, said there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that recording police, sharing that recording, and doing so anonymously is legal and protected under the First Amendment. Homeland Security <a href=\"https://www.aclunorcal.org/press-releases/dhs-withdraws-subpoena-seeking-unmask-instagram-users-who-posted-about-ice-raids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">withdrew its subpoena</a> without providing an explanation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ACLU called the subpoena “part of a broader strategy to intimidate people who document immigration activity or criticize government actions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg reported the effort to unmask the @montcowatch account was not an isolated incident, referencing at least four other cases where Homeland Security officials used administrative subpoenas in efforts to identify the people running Instagram accounts publishing content critical of the government. Those subpoenas were also withdrawn after the account owners sued to block the attempt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech companies have in recent years published transparency reports that detail how many government demands for data they receive. But most do not break out how many judicial and administrative subpoenas they receive over a period of time, even though the two kinds of demands are fundamentally different.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked by TechCrunch, Meta spokesperson Francis Brennan did not say if Meta provided Homeland Security any data involving @montcowatch or if the company was asked to provide information about the account another way. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A new report by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2026/02/03/homeland-security-administrative-subpoena/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post on Tuesday</a> found that an administrative subpoena was also used to seek information from Google about an American retiree within hours of him after sending a critical email to Homeland Security’s lead attorney Joseph Dernbach. The retiree’s home was later visited by federal agents inquiring about the email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post described the retiree as someone critical of Trump during his first term, who attended <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/protestors-voices-no-kings-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a No Kings rally last year</a>, regularly attends gatherings and protests, and wrote criticisms to lawmakers, all actions protected under the First Amendment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within five hours of emailing the Homeland Security lawyer — who was named <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/10/30/trump-asylum-afghanistan-deport-immigration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in an article</a> about the case of an Afghan the U.S. was trying to deport and whose email address is listed on the Florida Bar’s website — the retiree received an email from Google, according to The Washington Post. The email notified him that his account had been subpoenaed by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The subpoena demanded to know the day, time, and duration of all his online sessions, his IP address and physical address, and a list of each service he used, and any other usernames and identifiable information relating to his account, such as his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two weeks later, Homeland Security agents were on his doorstep, asking him questions about the email that he sent to Dernbach, which the agents conceded broke no laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google spokesperson Katelin Jabbari told TechCrunch the company pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, “as we did in this instance,” referring to the subpoena referenced in The Washington Post’s reporting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked by TechCrunch, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin would not say why the U.S. was seeking information about people who have been critical of the Trump administration and accounts documenting ICE activity, or say for what reason the subpoenas were withdrawn.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“HSI has broad administrative subpoena authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(d) and 19 U.S.C. § 1509(a)(1) to issue subpoenas,” said McLaughlin, referring to Homeland Security Investigations, an investigative unit within ICE.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not all companies are able to hand over data about their customers. For instance, information that is end-to-end encrypted and can only be accessed by obtaining a person’s phone or devices. That said, many companies are still able to provide large amounts of information about their users, including where they log in, how they log in, and from where, which may allow investigators to unmask anonymous accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">End-to-end encrypted messaging apps, like Signal, have long championed how little data it collects about its users. The messaging app responds to occasional legal demands by stating that it is <a href=\"https://signal.org/bigbrother/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unable to produce user data</a> that it does not have to begin with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reliance on U.S. tech giants is another reason why <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/amid-trump-attacks-and-weaponized-sanctions-europeans-look-to-rely-less-on-us-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">European countries</a> and ordinary consumers are seeking to rely less on American tech giants, at a time when chief executives and senior leaders at some of the largest U.S. tech companies are overtly cozying up to the Trump administration.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup has stripped out dozens of mechanical flight controls like gauges and switches and replaced them with a system containing several flight computers that automate the more complicated and dangerous aspects of flying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not a fully autonomous system; a pilot must still handle the operations. But it’s designed to automate the trickiest aspects of flying, enhance the skills of pilots, and improve safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That simplicity and ease of operation — a literal <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/skyryse-brings-in-200m-to-make-flying-an-aircraft-as-simple-as-swiping-a-touchscreen/\">swipe of the finger on a touchscreen</a> — has won over companies like United Rotorcraft, Air Methods, and Mitsubishi Corporation, which have contracts with Skyryse to integrate SkyOS on a variety of helicopters and airplanes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Skyryse started building and testing its system on helicopters, one of the most unstable aircraft to operate. But the idea is that SkyOS can be applied to any aircraft. That initial operating system, known as Skyryse One, automates takeoff and landing and fully automates hover and engine-out emergency landings. The company has since integrated the operating system on Black Hawk helicopters.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Skyryse has made progress on its certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration.

On Tuesday, the company <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/xcode-26-point-3-unlocks-the-power-of-agentic-coding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the release of Xcode 26.3, which will allow developers to use agentic tools, including Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://claude.com/blog/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Claude Agent</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/openais-codex-is-part-of-a-new-cohort-of-agentic-coding-tools/\">OpenAI’s Codex</a>, directly in Apple’s official app development suite.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Xcode 26.3 Release Candidate is available to all Apple Developers today from the developer website and will hit the App Store a bit later. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This latest update comes on the heels of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/apple-brings-chatgpt-and-other-ai-models-to-xcode/\">Xcode 26 release last year</a>, which introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple’s other hardware platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The integration of agentic coding tools allows AI models to tap into more of Xcode’s features to perform their tasks and perform more complex automation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models will also have access to Apple’s current developer documentation to ensure they use the latest APIs and follow the best practices as they build. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, the agents can help developers explore their project, understand its structure and metadata, then build the project and run tests to see if there are any errors and fix them, if so. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089199\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=1200,696 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=1280,742 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=430,249 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=720,417 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=900,522 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=800,464 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=2048,1187 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=668,387 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=647,375 647w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=1064,617 1064w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=708,410 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To prepare for this launch, Apple said it worked closely with both Anthropic and OpenAI to design the new experience. Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode’s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-Codex vs. GPT-5.1 mini).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple’s provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089200\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=1200,696 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=1280,742 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=430,249 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=720,417 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=900,522 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=800,464 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=2048,1187 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=668,387 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=647,375 647w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=1064,617 1064w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=708,410 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it’s easy to see what’s happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what’s happening under the hood. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/events/view/KT5L4XTWKQ/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a “code-along” workshop on Thursday</a> on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real time with their own copy of Xcode.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New York City and others like it are filled with old buildings that are for the most part fine, except they’re not all that comfortable to live in. Built in an era when massive boilers were cutting-edge technology, the buildings are usually too hot or too cold, but seldom just right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are companies trying to rectify that using clever horseshoe-shaped <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/arch-heat-pump-seed-round/\">heat pumps</a>. Superficially, they’re similar to window air conditioners, except they don’t block the view and they can heat as well as cool. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.gradientcomfort.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gradient</a> makes one of those heat pumps, but now it’s adding a twist: In multifamily buildings, it can link every one of its window units together. The startup shared with TechCrunch exclusive details about the new Nexus software and service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Multifamily buildings are an ignored sector,” Vince Romanin, chief technology officer at Gradient, told TechCrunch. “It’s a place where we can do better for the user.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is mostly targeting old buildings that need HVAC upgrades. Gradient has worked with the New York City Housing Authority to install its heat pumps in public housing, and it ran a pilot in Tracy, California, in a newer two-story affordable-housing complex. It’s also talking with colleges and universities, many of which have dorms that weren’t built with hot autumn weather in mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Old buildings often have one electric meter, which can tempt residents into overusing their heating or air conditioning. Nexus gives some control back to building managers. They can set guardrails to prevent people from overusing the heat or AC — either intentionally or otherwise — while still allowing them to be comfortable. In one instance, a building manager set the heating limit at 78˚ F, and the next day energy consumption dropped by a quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Romanin said Gradient’s heat pumps are the “lowest-cost option” for old buildings with boilers that are reaching end of life, a common occurrence in New York City. As a bonus, units that previously only had a steam radiator now get air conditioning, future proofing the units against worsening heat waves. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By installing a window unit rather than a minisplit, retrofits can happen within hours. They also don’t require electrical upgrades, Romanin said. In buildings with old electrical wiring that can’t support a full 12 amp load on a single outlet, Nexus can reduce the draw, said Mansi Shah, senior vice president of product and software at Gradient.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That strategy can extend beyond the building too. When the grid is overwhelmed by demand, which can happen on hot summer days, Gradient is working on a way to dial back its heat pumps while still maintaining occupant comfort. By using information about the building along with feedback from sensors in the heat pumps, the company hopes to predict which units can reduce their air conditioning demand, like those on the shady side of a building. That sort of demand response can help the grid serve more heat pumps without requiring costly upgrades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a lot of people who said when we electrify everything, the grid won’t handle it,” Romanin said. “I think that it is very possible to electrify everything and make the grid better, make the grid’s job easier, and make electrons cheaper.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That makes the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://watchclubtv.com/\">Watch Club</a> founder quite unique within this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-like-microdramas-are-going-to-make-billions-this-year-even-though-they-kind-of-suck/\">multibillion-dollar industry</a> of apps that churn out formulaic, cringe-worthy content and use aggressive tactics to maximize in-app spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ninety percent of these stories are, ‘I’m a poor girl! I fell in love with a secret billionaire! He’s a werewolf, and his mother is a vampire, and she disapproves of me!’” Soong told TechCrunch. “There’s a market for that, and we shouldn’t laugh at that, but I think this can be so much bigger than just sloppy, AI-adjacent romance soap operas.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soong’s comments are a little combative, but they’re not wrong. Competitor ReelShort made $1.2 billion in in-app purchases last year, while DramaBox made $276 million. The quality, he said, is so milquetoast that it could feasibly be made using AI-generated scripts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What would be the earning potential for a microdrama app that makes shows that are actually good and worth talking about?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soong is trying to answer that question with Watch Club, an app with microdrama stories made by SAG and WGA actors and writers (leading apps like DramaBox and ReelShort do not use union talent). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soong, a former Meta product manager who describes himself as “a fangirl, through and through,” thinks that what makes TV so special is the communities that form around them. Given his experience working on social products, he’s also seeking to differentiate Watch Club from existing microdrama apps by embedding a social network within it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think you can actually build such a more interesting business if you take what makes TV truly the most fun,” he said, pointing out “Heated Rivalry” as an example of what he’s talking about. “You watch it, and then you just want to gossip with your three best friends about it, or see what 100,000 funny, clever other young women or gay people on the internet are saying.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, people chat about “Severance” theories on Reddit, or they react to the “Stranger Things” finale on Tumblr. Before Twitter became the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\">cesspool</a> that is X, you had to work hard to avoid “Succession” or “White Lotus” spoilers. Soong sees the potential of housing both the show and the fan forums in one place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How will that app make money? Like most early-stage, venture-funded companies, that’s a question to punt for now, until it’s clear how users are engaging with the app. The answer may be ads, but the idea alone was interesting enough to secure seed funding led by GV. Watch Club also received checks from individuals like Patreon founder and CEO Jack Conte, as well as current and former executives from Hulu, HBO Max, and Meta. Upside Ventures, the firm run by major U.K. YouTubers <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sidemen/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Sidemen</a>, also participated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soong doesn’t have a background in film, which is why he brought in <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/devon-albert-stone-4aa3351ba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Devon Albert-Stone</a> as founding producer. He said he plans to hire WGA writers to create a slate of 10 shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We work with brilliantly talented people when they have a few months free to go work on something that may not be huge budget because we offer them huge creative latitude to go do something that Amazon would never let them do at a speed and velocity that feels way more exciting than the glacial pace of the television industry,” Soong said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added: “I’m really good at figuring out how to monetize businesses that seem almost impossible to monetize.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Meta, his mission from 2016 to 2019 was to figure out how to make money in China, a country where no one could use Meta’s products. By 2019, Soong said, Meta generated $5 billion per year of ad sales for companies within China who wanted to advertise to audiences outside of the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chinese ad sales may not be as glamorous as film and TV, but that job gave him additional context to understand the business model behind microdrama apps, which boomed in China at the end of the last decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Right around the time that I was leaving Meta [in 2019] is when these Chinese micro drama apps started spending all this money buying ads on Instagram so that Americans and Germans would download ReelShort and DramaBox,” he said. “I know this business playbook. I know how expensive and capital-intensive it is, and I think you can build a way better microdrama business if you aren’t 100% dependent on paid user acquisition.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Return Offer Season 1 | Official Trailer | Watch Club\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mNAjvpyogrQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Watch Club will have its first opportunity to test its concept when it releases its first show, “Return Offer,” which it plans to distribute on its app with daily episodes. On Tuesday, the company shared the first trailer for the show — which is about a group of tech interns in San Francisco competing for a return offer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My goal is to prove that our high-quality stories can give birth to the thing that supplants streaming television, and part of doing that is by building welcoming, creative sets with talented professionals, where people are having fun, despite small budgets, making something wonderful,” Soong said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
