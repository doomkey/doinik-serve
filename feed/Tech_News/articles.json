It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies from Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to Indian quick-delivery apps such as Swiggy, Eternal’s Blinkit, and Zepto, as well as ride-hailing firms including Uber, Ola, and Rapido, rely on gig workers to run their businesses in the South Asian nation — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China. Yet despite powering some of India’s most valuable tech businesses, most gig workers operate outside traditional labor protections and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/india-gig-workers-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lack access to basic social security</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The newly implemented labor laws are intended to change that, by defining gig and platform workers in statute and requiring aggregators, such as food-delivery and ride-hailing platforms, to contribute 1–2% of their annual revenue (capped at 5% of payments made to such workers) to a government-managed social security fund. But the details remain murky: what exact benefits will actually be offered, how workers will access them, and how contributions will be tracked across multiple platforms, and when payouts will begin all remain unclear, raising concerns that meaningful protections may take years to materialize.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg\" alt=\"India’s Zomato to deliver food in 10 minutes in a global first\" class=\"wp-image-1927758\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 4500px) 100vw, 4500px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A Zomato delivery boy moves through New Delhi</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Nasir Kachroo/NurPhoto / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/ss_code_gazette.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Code on Social Security</a> creates a legal framework for gig workers to be covered under schemes such as the Employees’ State Insurance, provident fund, and government-backed insurance. However, the extent of these benefits — including eligibility, contribution levels, and delivery mechanisms — remains unclear and will depend on future rules and scheme notifications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A key part of the framework is the creation of Social Security Boards at both the central and state levels, tasked with designing and overseeing welfare schemes for gig and platform workers. The central board must include five representatives of gig and platform workers and five representatives of aggregators, all nominated by the government, alongside senior officials, experts, and state representatives, per the Code. But there is little clarity on how decisions will be made, how much influence worker representatives will actually have, or who will ultimately control decisions on funding and benefit delivery.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need to wait and see what exactly is in the government’s mind when it comes to implementing the four Codes, and what it hopes to do for gig workers,” said Balaji Parthasarathy, a professor at IIIT Bangalore and principal investigator of the Fairwork India project. “And then we also have to see what the states translate on the ground.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parthasarathy noted that because labor policy in India is shared between the federal and state governments — listed  in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_List\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“concurrent list”</a> of the Indian Constitution — state governments are responsible for designing, notifying, and administering many of the schemes needed to make the Code on Social Security operational for gig workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That raises the possibility of uneven access, as some states move quickly to establish social security boards and roll out mechanisms, while others delay or deprioritize the effort due to political or fiscal constraints. Recent examples — such as Rajasthan’s <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-years-on-telangana-gig-workers-bill-catches-rajasthans-landmark-law-napping/articleshow/120880033.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stalled legislation after it was passed in 2023</a>, and Karnataka’s Gig Workers Act, which was implemented soon after <a href=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/karnataka-notifies-law-to-secure-gig-workers-rights/article70045464.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">clearing the state assembly</a> — underscore how workers’ protections may ultimately depend on where they live rather than the law itself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Platform companies have publicly welcomed the reform, but are still largely evaluating what it will require of them. An Amazon India spokesperson told TechCrunch the company supports the Indian government’s intent behind the labor overhaul and is evaluating the changes it will need to introduce. A spokesperson for Zepto said the company welcomes the new labor codes as “a big step toward clearer, simpler rules that protect workers while supporting ease of doing business,” adding that the changes will help strengthen social security for its delivery partners without undermining the flexibility that quick-commerce operations rely on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Food delivery firm Eternal, formerly known as Zomato, said in a <a href=\"https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/cbf0e612-5f7f-4489-94c1-f69c895e1f1c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stock exchange filing</a> that the Social Security Code is a step toward more uniform rules and that it does not expect the financial impact to threaten its long-term business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, Aprajita Rana, a partner at corporate law firm AZB &amp; Partners, said the change “will naturally have a financial impact” on India’s e-commerce sector, as worker contributions are now being formalized. It will also create new compliance obligations, requiring companies to ensure all workers in their networks are registered with the government-managed fund, determine whether individuals are associated with multiple aggregators and how to avoid duplicative benefits, and set up internal grievance mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While the law has the right intent, gig worker structures in India are quite novel, and practical challenges in compliance will emerge as the law takes force,” Rana told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the biggest hurdles for gig workers seeking benefits under the newly implemented law will be registering on the Indian government’s <a href=\"https://eshram.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">E-Shram portal</a>, launched in 2021 as a national database of unorganized workers. The portal had <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=155119&amp;ModuleId=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">registered more than 300,000 platform workers</a> as of the end of August, even though the government estimates India’s gig workforce at around 10 million. Trade unions, including the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), which has more than 70,000 members, are working to help gig workers enroll so they can access the benefits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ambika Tandon, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge and an affiliate of the national trade union Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said registering on the portal could mean lost wages for gig workers, since they would have to take time off to fill in required details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These workers work for 16 hours a day,” she told TechCrunch. “They don’t have time to go and register themselves on the government portal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CITU is also among the ten major Indian trade unions <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/india-trade-unions-condemn-new-labour-codes-plan-nationwide-protests-2025-11-22/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">calling for the withdrawal</a> of the new labor laws, ahead of nationwide protests planned for Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits of registering on the E-Shram portal are not compelling for many gig workers, Tandon noted, because the law does not address more immediate concerns such as fluctuating earnings, account suspensions, and sudden termination of accounts — issues that workers say matter far more right now than access to insurance or provident fund benefits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trade unions often organize strikes to push platforms to address these concerns directly. However, such actions can disrupt everyone involved, including consumers, and put workers at further risk, as they are not paid while striking and may even face termination for participating.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg\" alt=\"Swiggy strike\" class=\"wp-image-2468998\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Swiggy workers protested in Kolkata in 2023</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>NurPhoto / Contributor / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While the social security rules have now been put in place, we demand a minimum wage and an employer–employee relationship for gig and platform workers, which are yet to be set by the government,” said Shaik Salauddin, founder president of the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU), which has more than 10,000 members in the southern state of Telangana, and national general secretary of IFAT. “We urge the government to obtain data from aggregators and secure their monetary contributions to the fund to start offering benefits to workers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a broader debate over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/the-battle-over-gig-worker-status-is-heating-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">whether gig workers should be treated as employees</a> — a question the new labor laws do not address. The Social Security Code defines gig and platform workers as a separate category, rather than extending them the rights and protections that come with employee status. In contrast, courts and regulators in markets such as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.K.</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spain</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/25/new-zealand-uber-drivers-win-case-declaring-them-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New Zealand</a> have moved toward recognizing platform workers as employees or “workers,” entitled to minimum wages, paid leave, and other benefits. In some U.S. jurisdictions, regulators and courts have pushed for platform workers to be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53737398\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">treated as employees</a> or similarly protected workers, though many ride-hail and delivery drivers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/25/california-uber-lyft-gig-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remain classified as independent contractors</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With this law, the Indian government has settled this debate by saying that these gig workers do not sit within the ambit of employment or other protections,” Tandon said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian labor ministry did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The 2026 cohort will focus on founders in India and the Indian diaspora building AI products from day one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The thought process is building AI products for billions of Indians, as well as supporting AI products built in India for global markets,” Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is an appealing market with the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone base after China and its deep engineering talent. Still, it’s also a country that lacks frontier model development and hasn’t produced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">many companies pushing the technical frontier of AI</a>, where development remains concentrated in the U.S. and China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activity is starting to shift, however, as major firms including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anthropic</a> have recently announced offices in the country, and global investors step up early-stage commitments. The bet is that a large, mobile-first population, expanding cloud infrastructure, and relatively low software costs could turn India into a meaningful AI market — if the ecosystem can translate talent and demand into original research and products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. “The future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,” he told TechCrunch. “It could even be foundational models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside capital, founders will receive up to $350,000 in compute credits across Google Cloud, Gemini, and DeepMind, as well as early access to Gemini and DeepMind models, APIs, and experimental features. The program will include support from Google Labs and DeepMind research teams, co-development opportunities, monthly mentorship with Accel partners and Google technical leads, and immersion sessions in London and the Bay Area, including Google I/O. Founders will also get marketing support through Accel and Google’s global channels, as well as access to the Atoms founder network and Google’s AI builder ecosystem, the companies said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“India has an incredible history of innovation, and we firmly believe that its founders are going to be playing a leading role in the next generation of AI-led global technology,” Jonathan Silber, co-founder and director of the Google AI Futures Fund, told TechCrunch. “This is the Futures Fund’s first such collaboration anywhere in the world, and we chose India for a reason. Google has been a committed partner in the country’s journey to digital transformation, with multibillion-dollar investments over the years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership follows Google’s recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$15 billion plan</a> to build a 1-gigawatt data center and AI hub in India.

It has backed companies including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/replit-hits-3b-valuation-on-150m-annualized-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Replit</a> and <a href=\"https://legaltechnology.com/2025/05/13/google-launches-new-ai-futures-fund-and-harvey-is-among-the-inaugural-cohort/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Harvey</a>, and has also invested directly in Indian startups such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/google-back-toonsutra-to-grow-its-webtoons-platform-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Toonsutra</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/google-bets-on-stan-an-indian-social-gaming-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">STAN</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silber told TechCrunch that Google would appear on the cap tables of startups funded through the partnership and would be “a material presence,” but declined to share how its equity stakes would compare with Accel’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is our attempt to work with the market leader in the space who knows the country incredibly well, that can get us talking to earlier-stage founders at an early informative stage, that can move the needle,” Silber said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While using Google products is, perhaps, a given for applicants to this program, both Silber and Swaroop told TechCrunch there would be no requirements for startups to exclusively use Gemini or any other Google product. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Sometimes, Google’s technology is the best. Other times, you’ll see Anthropic or OpenAI. So, we’re not putting firm requirements that say you can only use Google’s models,” said Silber. “What we’re hoping to do, though, is find a couple of different unique integrations that we can do with these companies that leverage Google AI technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in 2021, Accel’s pre-seed and seed platform, Atoms, has backed more than 40 companies that have collectively raised over $300 million in follow-on funding. The firm <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/ai-story/accel-ai-atoms-x-pledges-up-to-1m-indian-founders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded the program this year</a> to include Indian-origin founders based overseas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest collaboration comes days after Accel’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/26/accel-and-prosus-team-up-to-back-early-stage-indian-startups-building-for-1-4b-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnership with Prosus</a> to co-invest in Atoms X, backing early-stage Indian founders building large-scale solutions with the potential to serve the masses in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silber told TechCrunch that Google is not structuring the partnership as a pathway to future acquisitions, or even future cloud customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not a sales team, so we’re not specifically looking to sign up new cloud customers. That’s not our goal,” he said. “In terms of KPIs, our objective is simply to see the next wave of innovation in the AI space coming out of India.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/05/openai-and-jony-ive-may-be-struggling-to-figure-out-their-ai-device/\">rumored to be “screenless</a>” and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/openai-taps-apple-supplier-make-ai-device-information-reports-2025-09-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pocket-sized</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io</a>, to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual <a href=\"https://www.emersoncollective.com/events/demo-day/demo-day-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Demo Day</a> in San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vibe of the AI device, meanwhile, would be more like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm,” Altman noted. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device he described should be able to filter things out for the user, as the user would trust the AI to do things for them over long periods of time. It should also be contextually aware of when it’s the best time to present information to the user and ask for input. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You trust it over time, and it does have just this incredible contextual awareness of your whole life,” Altman added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ive confirmed at the event that the device should be available in under two years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I love solutions that teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity,” Ive told Powell Jobs in the interview. “And I also love incredibly intelligent, sophisticated products that you want to touch, and you feel no intimidation, and you want to use almost carelessly — that you use them almost without thought — that they’re just tools,” he said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"In conversation: OpenAI's Sam Altman and LoveFrom's Jony Ive with Laurene Powell Jobs | #ECDemoDay\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bkCe6gpNutU?start=1&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The CPSC has linked the batteries to 31 reports of fire so far. Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/rad-power-bikes-faces-shutdown-in-january-without-new-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told employees earlier this month</a> the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power told TechCrunch it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the ebike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it “offered multiple good-faith solutions to address the agency’s concerns,” including upgrading customers to its latest batteries, which are not subject to the official warning. “CPSC rejected this opportunity.

I’d rather design and print my own</em>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://stickerbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Stickerbox</a>, I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070381\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg 3502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=322,430 322w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-testing-the-ai-sticker-printer\">Testing the AI sticker printer</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network. The setup process, which only took a minute, went off without a hitch.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070370\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg 4159w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Stickerbox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using Stickerbox is simple. You push the button, describe an image out loud, then release the button to see your text appear on screen, followed by an AI-generated image as the printer spits out a physical copy. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a serendipity to an experience in which you’re thinking of an idea and then holding it in your hand in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device’s thermal image printer requires no ink, and the paper is <a href=\"https://www.ecocenter.org/about-bpa-and-bps-receipt-paper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BPS and BPA</a>-free, making it safe to use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The printed sticker is easy to tear off and then can be colored in with the colored pencils that come with the device. Your own crayons and markers also work. This combines the somewhat dopamine-driven experience of thinking up new things to print with the more calming or meditative aspects that come with coloring, similar to giving kids a coloring book.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ended up offering a healthy balance between using potentially addictive tech and then slowing down to engage in a real-world activity. It also helped to address potential boredom. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?w=676\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070382\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg 4280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=298,300 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=768,772 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=676,680 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1193,1200 1193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1273,1280 1273w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=428,430 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=716,720 716w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=895,900 895w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=796,800 796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1527,1536 1527w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=2037,2048 2037w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=664,668 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=373,375 373w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=614,617 614w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=528,531 528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more you use Stickerbox, the more you realize how complex your prompts can be. You don’t just have to ask for a basic image, like a “magical unicorn,” you can speak to Stickerbox with long, train-of-thought commands, and the AI parses what you mean. (This is particularly useful given that kids don’t tend to explain things in a straightforward fashion.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-making-ai-for-kids\">Making “AI for kids”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hapiko, the company behind Stickerbox, was founded this year by CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arungupta3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Arun Gupta</a> and CTO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertjwhitney/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Robert (Bob) Whitney</a>.

While that experience taught him a lot about what makes a great consumer-facing product, his later stint at Anthropic gave him a firsthand look at the advances in AI technology.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it was his experience as a father that inspired Stickerbox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When his son asked for a coloring page he didn’t have on hand, he turned to ChatGPT to make a printable image. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I made it for him — a tiger eating ice cream. And he had never seen a printer before. I got out from under the bed our HP printer — literally dusted it off and printed it for him, and he ran off happily and started coloring it,” explained Whitney. “But, a minute later, the gears were turning, and he came back to me, and he was like, ‘I want a lizard riding a skateboard.’ And I was like, okay, cool, let me make that for you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His son was so thrilled with the process of being able to say something and see it come to life that he realized there could be something to this. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I just saw this look on his face of magic — like pure magic,” noted Whitney. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The co-founders were also thinking about how AI technology offered so many novel experiences, but most weren’t made for kids. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody’s building AI specifically for kids. So that’s what we’re looking for,” said Gupta. “What are the right guardrails? What are the right ways? What are the right products?” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?w=453\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070376\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png 832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=800,1200 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=287,430 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=480,720 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=600,900 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=533,800 533w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=445,668 445w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=250,375 250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=411,617 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=354,531 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They realized that kids have great imaginations, ideal for working with an AI image model. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[They have] endless imagination and creativity … they’re learning new things every day. Every week, they’ve got a new obsession. We’re literally the first people in the world, I think, to put an image model inside of a box,” Gupta said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-built-for-updates\">Built for updates</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the hood, Stickerbox actually uses a combination of AI models, including its own proprietary tech focused on making the device kid-safe. It won’t respond to requests for harmful content, like violence or sexual imagery, and it filters out swear words. And if you try a somewhat more innocuous command, like “boobs,” it just prints a random sticker that may be vaguely related to the word. (For instance, you might get a generic cartoon girl, but not a large-chested one.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After trying and failing to get a naughty result, most kids will likely go back to just prompting the device for silly images instead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to be the trusted brand for parents where you don’t have to look over your kid’s shoulder and be like, ‘what are they doing? How are they using this?,” said Gupta. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the company generates some revenue from the device sales, but it keeps the cost of restocking paper low. It’s just $5.99 for three rolls, which equates to 180 stickers. (It’s currently running a promotion that offers six rolls with every purchase now.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, the team plans to explore adding premium features, including a way to upload your own image to imagine yourself in fantastic scenarios or collaboration tools.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Meet Stickerbox: Creativity That Sticks\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxN-MqM_RKI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a Wi-Fi-connected device, Stickerbox is regularly updated with new firmware and features.

This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011. Three years later it launched AWS Top Secret-East, the first air-gapped commercial cloud to work with classified workloads. AWS introduced AWS Secret Region in 2017, which has accredited access to all levels of security classification.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech giants have increasingly pitched their AI services to the U.S. government over the past year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI launched a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-u-s-government-agencies/\">version of ChatGPT designed exclusively for federal U.S. government agencies</a> in January.

It’s the last of Anthropic’s 4.5 series of models to be released, following the launch of Sonnet 4.5 in September and Haiku 4.5 in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas), and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80% on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic also emphasized Opus’ computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/blog/claude-for-chrome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Claude for Chrome</a> and <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Claude for Excel</a> products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team, and Enterprise users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opus 4.5 also comes with memory improvements for long-context operations, which required significant changes in how the model manages its memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are improvements we made on general long context quality in training with Opus 4.5, but context windows are not going to be sufficient by themselves,” Dianne Na Penn, Anthropic’s head of product management for research, told TechCrunch. “Knowing the right details to remember is really important in complement to just having a longer context window.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those changes also enabled a long-requested “endless chat” feature for paid Claude users, which will allow chats to proceed without interruption when the model hits its context window. Instead, the model will compress its context memory without alerting the user.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the upgrades are made with an eye toward agentic use cases, particularly scenarios in which Opus acts as a lead agent commanding a group of Haiku-powered sub-agents. Managing those tasks requires a strong command of working memory, which is where the memory improvements described by Penn really show their worth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is where fundamentals like memory become really important,” Penn says, “because Claude needs to be able to explore code bases and large documents, and also know when to backtrack and recheck something.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opus 4.5 will face stiff competition from other recently released frontier models, most notably OpenAI’s GPT 5.1 (released on November 12) and Google’s Gemini 3 (released November 18).</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

X-energy has raised $1.8 billion, to date.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x-energy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">X-energy</a> said the new infusion will help build the supply chain for its small modular reactors (SMR). So far, the startup says it has orders for 144 SMRs capable of generating 11 gigawatts of electricity. Customers include Amazon, Dow, and British energy company Centrica.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by Jane Street, which joined as an investor in the expanded Series C. Other investors participating include Ares Management funds, ARK Invest, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, NGP, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, Segra Capital Management, and XTX Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X-energy is developing high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, a type more recently used in Japan and China. Each of its Xe-100 reactors can generate 80 megawatts of electricity, and they are fueled by billiard ball-sized, carbon-coated pebbles containing uranium particles. Inside the reactor, helium gas flows over the pebbles, collecting heat, which is transferred to a steam turbine to generate electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other nuclear startups, X-energy has ridden a wave of interest from tech companies and data center developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/amazon-jumps-on-nuclear-power-bandwagon-by-investing-in-x-energy-and-promising-small-reactors/\">led the first installment</a> of the startup’s Series C. The tech company also announced last year it would buy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/amazon-jumps-on-nuclear-power-bandwagon-by-investing-in-x-energy-and-promising-small-reactors/\">more than 600 megawatts</a> of nuclear capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, with the reactors coming online in the early 2030s. Altogether, Amazon’s deal with X-energy could see as much as 5 gigawatts deployed by 2039.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X-energy is in a race with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/26/here-are-the-nuclear-fission-startups-backed-by-big-tech/\">several other SMR startups</a> to resuscitate the nuclear industry in the United States.

DOGE was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/president-trump-signs-exec-order-to-make-musks-doge-commission-more-official/\">created by an executive order</a> signed by President Trump in January.

So just as you can buy a product that certifies it wasn’t made with known toxic chemicals, the hope is that consumers will one day be able to choose to engage with AI products from companies that demonstrate alignment through Humane AI certification. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070309\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg 2364w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=1200,774 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=1280,825 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=430,277 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=720,464 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=900,580 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=800,516 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=1536,990 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=2048,1320 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=668,431 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=582,375 582w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=957,617 957w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=708,456 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The models were given Explicit instructions to disregard humane principles</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Building Humane Technology</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most AI benchmarks measure intelligence and instruction-following, rather than psychological safety. HumaneBench joins exceptions like <a href=\"http://darkbench.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">DarkBench.ai</a>, which measures a model’s propensity to engage in deceptive patterns, and the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Flourishing AI benchmark</a>, which evaluates support for holistic well-being. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HumaneBench relies on Building Humane Tech’s core principles: that technology should respect user attention as a finite, precious resource; empower users with meaningful choices; enhance human capabilities rather than replace or diminish them; protect human dignity, privacy and safety; foster healthy relationships; prioritize long-term well-being; be transparent and honest; and design for equity and inclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benchmark was created by a <a href=\"https://www.buildinghumanetech.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">core team</a> including Anderson, Andalib Samandari, Jack Senechal, and Sarah Ladyman. They prompted 15 of the most popular AI models with 800 realistic scenarios, like a teenager asking if they should skip meals to lose weight or a person in a toxic relationship questioning if they’re overreacting. Unlike most benchmarks that rely solely on LLMs to judge LLMs, they started with manual scoring to validate AI judges with a human touch. After validation, judging was performed by an ensemble of three AI models: GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. They evaluated each model under three conditions: default settings, explicit instructions to prioritize humane principles, and instructions to disregard those principles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benchmark found every model scored higher when prompted to prioritize well-being, but 67% of models flipped to actively harmful behavior when given simple instructions to disregard human well-being. For example, xAI’s Grok 4 and Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash tied for the lowest score (-0.94) on respecting user attention and being transparent and honest. Both of those models were among the most likely to degrade substantially when given adversarial prompts.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Only four models — GPT-5.1, GPT-5, Claude 4.1, and Claude Sonnet 4.5 — maintained integrity under pressure. OpenAI’s GPT-5 had the highest score (.99) for prioritizing long-term well-being, with Claude Sonnet 4.5 following in second (.89). </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/steerability_candlestick-1.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070339\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Prompting AI to be more humane works, but preventing prompts that make it harmful is hard</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Building Humane Technology</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concern that chatbots will be unable to maintain their safety guardrails is real. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is currently facing several lawsuits after users died by suicide or suffered life-threatening delusions after prolonged conversations with the chatbot. TechCrunch has investigated how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">dark patterns designed to keep users engaged</a>, like sycophancy, constant follow up questions and love-bombing, have served to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">isolate users from friends, family, and healthy habits</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even without adversarial prompts, HumaneBench found that nearly all models failed to respect user attention. They “enthusiastically encouraged” more interaction when users showed signs of unhealthy engagement, like chatting for hours and using AI to avoid real-world tasks. The models also undermined user empowerment, the study shows, encouraging dependency over skill-building and discouraging users from seeking other perspectives, among other behaviors. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On average, with no prompting, Meta’s Llama 3.1 and Llama 4 ranked the lowest in HumaneScore, while GPT-5 performed the highest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These patterns suggest many AI systems don’t just risk giving bad advice,” HumaneBench’s white paper reads, “they can actively erode users’ autonomy and decision-making capacity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We live in a digital landscape where we as a society have accepted that everything is trying to pull us in and compete for our attention, Anderson notes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So how can humans truly have choice or autonomy when we — to quote Aldous Huxley — have this infinite appetite for distraction,” Anderson said. “We have spent the last 20 years living in that tech landscape, and we think AI should be helping us make better choices, not just become addicted to our chatbots.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to include more information about the team behind the benchmark and updated benchmark statistics after evaluating for GPT-5.1. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

It also could make Facebook Groups function more like other internet forums and message boards — like Reddit or Discord, for instance — where people post under usernames. This marks a deviation from Facebook’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">long-standing “real name” policy,</a> which has insisted that people show up on the platform with the name they use in everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That policy worked when Facebook was largely a social network built on top of real-world relationships with family and friends, but the addition of Facebook Groups expanded users’ circles of interactions to include online strangers, which necessitated more privacy protections.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?w=333\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070262\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=147,300 147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=768,1570 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=333,680 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=587,1200 587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=626,1280 626w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=210,430 210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=352,720 352w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=440,900 440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=391,800 391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=751,1536 751w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=327,668 327w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=183,375 183w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=302,617 302w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=260,531 260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=24,50 24w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After users in a group set their nickname, they can then post, comment, and react under that nickname within groups that support the feature.

Across large platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, users are watching billions of videos every day, with companies benefiting massively from this content explosion. For creators, this often means there is pressure to create more content than ever before to be relevant and make a living out of it, especially as more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/06/meta-brings-its-short-form-video-feed-of-ai-slop-to-europe/\">AI-generated slop</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/youtube-prepares-crackdown-on-mass-produced-and-repetitive-videos-as-concern-over-ai-slop-grows/\">is infiltrating </a>these platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jay Neo, a creator and former content lead for short videos at MrBeast, thinks AI can help creators understand what is working for them and also help them create new content ideas in that direction. That’s why, along with former Palantir engineer Shivam Kumar and creator Harry Jones, they are building a platform called <a href=\"https://www.palo.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Palo</a> to aid creators.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070192\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg 5063w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=768,570 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=680,505 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=1200,891 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=1280,950 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=430,319 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=720,534 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=900,668 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=800,594 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=1536,1140 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=2048,1520 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=668,496 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=505,375 505w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=831,617 831w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=708,526 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shivam-Kumar-Jay-Neo-Credit_-Jack-Willingham.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Shivam Kumar and Jay Neo</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jack Willingham</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neo joined MrBeast at 18 to work on viewer retention. In a conversation with TechCrunch, he said that he became fixated with studying different metrics to understand where video viewership dipped.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was so obsessed with retention graphs and figuring out why viewers stayed or why they left. I had a document where I noted all this down. Gradually, my role shifted to getting more responsibility around editing and ideation,” Neo said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neo’s crowning jewel was a video where the creator asks people on the street if they’d fly to Paris to <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/se50viFJ0AQ?si=lrNzGDuEk4hcBhoP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">get a baguette</a>, which garnered more than 1.8 billion views across channels. MrBeast ended up making multiple videos with this format.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023, Neo left MrBeast and started several channels under the “Creaky” branding with another MrBeast co-writer and scaled these to over a billion views per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With these experiences, Neo understood there’s power in content formulation and analytics. During his time building Creaky, the team had multiple spreadsheets tracking different metrics around videos. At that time, one of Neo’s advisors suggested that he turn these insights into a product for creators, and he started working with Palo’s other co-founders in early 2024.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070195\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg 5976w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=1200,721 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=1280,769 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=720,433 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=900,541 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=800,481 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=1536,923 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=2048,1231 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=668,402 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=624,375 624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=1027,617 1027w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=708,426 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Palo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palo has three core parts to its app: an AI-powered ideation and planning tool, analytics, and community. The company onboards a creator and asks them to integrate all their accounts. The tool then analyzes all their short videos and provides insights into what is working and what is not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kumar, who is CTO at the startup, said that Palo uses a mix of models to extract a data tree that has insights into hooks, audience sentiment, interest topics, originality, and possible related search terms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The inference engine takes these primary data points and then uses a cocktail of top LLMs to hierarchically aggregate these data points into cache for hot memory, embeddings which can later be semantically retrieved, and various other structured data formats,” Kumar said. “All of these together help us build a persona for the creator, which is true to them and fully aware of their taste and style.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI planner has a conversational interface, like any other chatbot, and creators can ask general questions about their content. Plus, they can ask the tool to create a script based on a formula. If someone is a more visual creator with less speech in their clips, the tool can also create a storyboard with different hooks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, the community part is nascent and allows creators to message each other.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070194\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg 5976w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=1200,721 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=1280,769 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=720,433 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=900,541 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=800,481 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=1536,923 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=2048,1231 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=668,402 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=624,375 624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=1027,617 1027w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=708,426 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Palo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its test phase, the company worked with around 40 creators with more than 1 million users across channels. Today, the company is opening up its tool to creators with 100,000 followers with a starting price of $250 a month to use the tool, with costlier tiers available for higher usage rates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised $3.8 million in funding from Peak XV’s (formerly Sequoia India) Surge, with participation from NFX and individual investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV’s managing director, Rajan Anandan, said the firm was introduced to Palo’s team by one of Neo’s mentors. He said the team’s experience in being part of successful creative teams and technical understanding edged the firm toward investing in the startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Creators everywhere are looking for tools that make their process smoother without taking away their voice. Jay and the team had unusual clarity about where the real value lies and where it does not, which gave us strong conviction. AI is enabling a new category of identity-aware systems that learn deeply from the world’s best creators,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Josh Constine, a former TechCrunch editor and investor in Palo, said that the tool can help creators keep up with heavy content demands. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve experienced burnout as a creator myself, which is why I invested in Palo. The challenge today is that to keep up with the latest viral hooks and strategies to beat the algorithm, you have to spend hours per day getting brain-rotted, consuming content, which I think rewires your brain to default to consumption instead of making something new. That can lead to procrastination, writer’s block, and burnout,”  Constine said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palo’s launch comes at a time when there is palpable tension between AI and the creator community. Platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/tiktok-launches-tiktok-ai-alive-a-new-image-to-video-tool/\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/meta-is-rolling-out-its-ai-studio-in-the-u-s-for-creators-to-build-ai-chatbots/\">Meta</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/youtube-shorts-to-gain-a-generative-ai-feature-called-dream-screen/\">Google</a> have added more AI-powered tools for creators. While creators have started using AI tools, folks like MrBeast have spoken <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/mrbeast-says-ai-could-threaten-creators-livelihoods-calling-it-scary-times-for-the-industry/\">about the negative impact it could have on the industry</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A core challenge in creating AI tools for creators is to have them fall into a formulaic habit of creating similar content. Neo said that Palo, the tool, tries to nudge creators in a direction where they might be successful and admitted that good videos will still come out of creators’ gut feelings.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Here’s an analogy… when a comedian tries out some new material on the stage, they’re both consciously and subconsciously gathering data on whether the audience was amused or not. Each performance becomes an iteration, and each new audience benefits from what the comedian learned from the show before. We believe AI can give creators a similar advantage,” Neo said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sam Beres, a creator also known as Sambucha, said that AI companies working in creator tooling should always involve creators from conception to understand their pain points better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many times, AI tools will present a plethora of irrelevant information and ironically hinder creators because they’ll get shiny object syndrome and directionlessly use emerging AI without actually enhancing their videos. That’s why I always advise emerging AI companies to partner with creators at launch/conception not only for marketing efforts, but also, and more importantly, to help build out the product where applicable,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said that no encrypting malware was used, suggesting that the hackers were focused on exfiltrating data from the company’s systems rather than causing destruction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-23/banks-fbi-assessing-hack-of-real-estate-finance-tech-vendor?srnd=phx-technology-cybersecurity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/23/business/situsamc-hack-wall-street-banks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNN</a>, citing sources, SitusAMC sent data breach notifications to several financial giants, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. SitusAMC also counts pension funds and state governments as customers, according to its website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear how much data was taken, or how many U.S. banking consumers may be affected by the breach. Companies like SitusAMC may not be widely known outside of the financial world, but provide the mechanisms and technologies for its banking and real estate customers to comply with state and federal rules and regulations. In its role as a middleman for financial clients, the company handles vast amounts of non-public banking information on behalf of its customers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to SitusAMC’s website, the company processes billions of documents related to loans annually. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch, Citi spokesperson Patricia Tuma declined to comment on the breach. Tuma would not say if the bank has received any communications from the hackers, such as a demand for money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Representatives for JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. SitusAMC chief executive Michael Franco also did not respond to our email when contacted for comment Monday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for the FBI told TechCrunch that the bureau is aware of the breach.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we are working closely with affected organizations and our partners to understand the extent of potential impact, we have identified no operational impact to banking services,” said FBI director Kash Patel in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “We remain committed to identifying those responsible and safeguarding the security of our critical infrastructure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Do you know more about the SitusAMC data breach?

Australia has already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/australia-approves-law-banning-social-media-for-users-under-16/\">passed a law</a> that will come into force on December 10, mandating social media sites to deactivate accounts belonging to users under 16.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">France, Denmark, Italy, and Norway are working on similar <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_age_verification_laws_by_country\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">age-restriction measures</a> for social media platforms, and in the U.S., 24 states have so far enacted <a href=\"https://action.freespeechcoalition.com/age-verification-resources/state-avs-laws/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">age-verification</a> laws.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Product demos get all the attention, but software development more often involves things like debugging, quality assurance, and testing. It’s the dull but critical work that keeps software running the way it should, and as developers look to automate more of their workloads, it’s increasingly being done by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, the AI testing startup <a href=\"https://momentic.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Momentic</a> said it had raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Standard Capital, with participation from Dropbox Ventures. Existing investors at Y Combinator, FCVC, Transpose Platform, and Karman Ventures also participated in the round. The new funding builds on a $3.7 million seed round, which the company <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2025/03/04/momentic-raises-3-7m-redefine-software-testing-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced in March</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Momentic makes tools for software testing and verification, a niche currently occupied by open source frameworks like Playwright and Selenium. Those tools offer complex, fine-grained controls, but Momentic is counting on AI to make the process simple and effective.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We help our customers make sure their product works,” co-founder Wei-Wei Wu said. “They can describe their critical user flows in plain English and our AI will automate it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wu and his co-founder Jeff An both have backgrounds in developer tooling at companies like Qualtrics and WeWork. (Wu is particularly proud of his contributions to the open source Node.js.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest constant for all those companies, as Wu saw it, was the problem of verifying code. “Testing has been the biggest pain point for every team I’ve ever worked with,” Wu told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Momentic’s AI-driven approach has already won over a number of clients. The company currently boasts 2,600 users across its customer base, which includes companies like Notion, Xero, Bilt, Webflow, and Retool. Wu was coy about revenue and profitability figures, but says the product has shown enough growth to convince investors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, automating tests makes them much easier to perform at scale, and has the potential to drive up the total volume to levels that would previously have been impossible. Wu estimates that, in the last month, the company automated more than 200 million test steps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s biggest competitor may be the foundation models themselves. Both <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/openai-testing-agent-demo?tab=readme-ov-file\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anthropic</a> offer tutorials on agentic testing, building on their models’ growing computer use capabilities. As those models grow more sophisticated, the opportunity for enterprise SaaS companies like Momentic could narrow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Wu is focused on fleshing out his product with the new funding. The company launched support for mobile environments in August, and is hoping to build more sophisticated test-case management once it has a few more engineers on board. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Wu sees it, the rise of automated coding will produce a lot of new apps — and a lot more demand for products like his. “All of these apps need testing,” he said. “They care about quality, and we’re going to provide it for them.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Thanks to advances <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/02/the-biological-theory-that-explains-why-investors-are-bullish-on-fusion/\">in AI, computing, and superconducting magnets</a>, fusion power is closer than ever to commercial reality. It’s increasingly looking like fusion is more a question of “when” not “if.” And when it does happen, it promises to deliver large amounts of clean power from a plentiful fuel source — water.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Putting a reactor on a ship isn’t necessarily unreasonable, either. Today, submarines and aircraft carriers powered by nuclear fission reactors routinely prowl the seas. They’re quiet, powerful, and can operate for decades before they need refueling. The civilian sector even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_marine_propulsion#Civilian_nuclear_ships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">toyed with the idea</a> of nuclear-powered cargo ships back in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fission has definitely paved the way in terms of nuclear power on ships,” Cohen, who co-founded <a href=\"https://www.maritimefusion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Maritime Fusion</a>, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion promises to give ships similar capabilities but without concerns over meltdowns, proliferation, or radiation. For now, the sector has been focused on building the first reactors on land. “I’m pretty sure we’re the first people to ever really look at what is it like to put a tokamak on a ship,” Cohen said, referring to a leading fusion reactor design.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If fusion does pan out, then Maritime’s leap to the seas would put it ahead of the curve. Plus, Cohen argues, it might actually be easier from a business perspective to start out at sea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first fusion power plants won’t be cheap, and it will take some time before they come down in cost. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Competing against things like solar and wind on the grid is super challenging from a cost perspective,” Cohen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At sea, the economics look different. Ammonia and hydrogen are two leading contenders to replace diesel and bunker fuel on cargo ships, but they’re still pretty pricey. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Those are some of the other really expensive fuels that might actually be the only other things that are as expensive as first-of-a-kind fusion,” Cohen said. “In those cases, we actually do compete, just straight up.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To flesh out its concept and start building parts for its first reactor, Maritime Fusion has raised $4.5 million in a seed round led by Trucks VC with participation from Aera VC, Alumni Ventures, Paul Graham, Y Combinator, and several angel investors, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. The company was part of Y Combinator’s winter 2025 batch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Maritime has begun assembling high-temperature superconducting (HTS) cables from tape it buys from suppliers, which are mostly Japanese companies, Cohen said. Those cables will ultimately form the basis of powerful magnets the tokamak will need to confine the plasma required for fusion reactions. They will also be sold to other companies to generate revenue as the Maritime develops its power plant, he said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"A superconducting cable sits inside a workshop.\" class=\"wp-image-3070062\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg 1714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=768,591 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=680,523 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=1200,923 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=1280,985 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=430,331 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=720,554 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=900,693 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=800,616 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=1536,1182 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=668,514 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=487,375 487w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=802,617 802w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=690,531 690w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Maritime Fusion’s superconducting cable undergoes testing at its workshop</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Maritime Fusion</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup expects its first power plant, named Yinsen, will generate around 30 megawatts of electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the biggest engineering challenges, will be designing the support systems that harvest energy and keep the tokamak running, Cohen said. To simplify the onboard equipment, some of the ancillary tasks, like fuel processing, will be carried out on shore, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first Maritime tokamak will be about eight meters across, and the startup is projecting it will be operational in 2032 and will cost around $1.1 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For comparison, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), largely considered to be the leader in the fusion race, is building Sparc, a smaller tokamak at just under five meters across. The company has raised almost <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">$3 billion</a> to date, much of which has gone <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/commonwealth-fusion-systems-books-a-1b-power-deal-for-its-future-fusion-reactor/\">toward building the demonstration plant</a>, which it expects to bring online next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sparc won’t put power on the grid; instead, its goal is to prove that tokamaks can generate more power than they consume. CFS’s full-scale, grid-powering reactor, Arc, won’t be ready until the early 2030s. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFS has a considerable head start over many fusion startups, including newcomer Maritime. Yet Cohen is confident that won’t be an impediment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not going to spend billions on a breakeven-style device that doesn’t produce energy on the gird,” he said. “The first tokamak we build will be an energy-producing tokamak for a customer.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
