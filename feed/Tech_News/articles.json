The order affects lesser-known, but wildly popular services like Ullu and ALTT that cater to the country’s mass-market appetite for adult and edgy entertainment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued directives to block access to websites and apps linked to 25 streaming services, citing provisions of the Information Technology Act of 2000 and the IT Rules of 2021, TechCrunch learned.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order came months after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology raised concerns about mature content being streamed on these platforms without adequate safeguards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government contacted internet service providers and app stores, including Google Play and the Apple App Store earlier this week to restrict these streaming services, a source privy to the matter told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of these services, especially the major ones with millions of subscribers, remained live at the time of filing this article.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. The information and broadcasting minister also did not respond to an email sent Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of the 25 streaming services, 10 offered in-app purchases through their apps on Google Play and the App Store, generating a cumulative $5.7 million since launch with nearly 105 million downloads, per the Appfigures data exclusively shared with TechCrunch. The wide gap between in-app purchases and downloads is primarily due to their low subscription costs — significantly lower than Netflix and other global platforms in India.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031363\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg 1265w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=300,235 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=768,602 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=680,533 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=1200,941 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=430,337 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=720,565 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=900,706 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=800,627 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=668,524 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=478,375 478w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=787,617 787w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=677,531 677w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1265px) 100vw, 1265px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Lifetime totals of banned streaming services from Google Play and Apple App Store</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Appfigures</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, some of these streaming services were either never listed on traditional app stores or had been removed earlier, and instead offered their apps as direct APK downloads. As of publication, some of these APK files were still accessible through their websites or third-party platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Indian production company Balaji Telefilms, the parent of ALTT, <a href=\"https://www.balajitelefilms.com/pdf/quaterlyreports/fy2024-25/PRESSRELEASEMARCH25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disclosed</a> that its streaming app generated ₹202.6 million ($2.3 million) in revenue by adding 1.06 million subscribers in 2025. ALTT’s content was watched for more than 5.8 million hours, garnering 160 million annual views, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ALTT’s app was no longer available for download through Google Play and the App Store in India, and its website was inaccessible on most Indian ISPs at the time of filing this article.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Balaji Telefilms did not respond to a request for comment on the ban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ullu, another relatively prominent streaming service named by the Indian government, remained available via its app on the Indian Play Store, and its website was accessible as well. The service’s iOS app, however, was not available for download from the Indian App Store.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ullu Digital, the parent company of Ullu, reported a net profit of ₹212.3 million ($2.5 million) for the financial year 2024, per its regulatory filing reviewed by TechCrunch. The company posted a revenue of ₹931.4 million ($11 million) and declared a net worth of ₹2.08 billion ($24 million).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ullu Digital did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside millions of dollars in subscription revenue, these streaming services were also attracting millions of global visits to their

the first time the streaming business has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/20/india-netflix-amazon-movies-self-censorship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">seen a crackdown</a> in India. Global platforms, including Amazon Prime Video and Netflix often <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/netflix-bows-to-censorship-stops-streaming-uncut-indian-films-globally/article67641054.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">face instances of censorship</a> by the Indian government. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, even stricter actions are seen in cases of obscenity despite a lack of clarity on regulations, as watching explicit content featuring fully consensual interactions between adult actors in a private space <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cant-stop-an-adult-from-watching-porn-in-his-room-says-sc/article7400690.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is not a crime</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023, the then Indian information broadcasting minister warned streaming platforms <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/20/india-wont-tolerate-abusive-obscene-content-on-streaming-services-minister-warns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not to serve abusive and obscene content</a>. New Delhi has also blocked <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/did-india-porn-ban-reduce-traffic-popular-adult-sites/article67247600.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">thousands of websites streaming pornographic content</a>.

Smaller streaming services — like those targeted in this crackdown — often reappear under new names, apps, and domains. It is equally difficult for intermediaries like Google, Apple, and internet providers to fully block access, as these platforms often spread through alternative channels and use social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube to attract viewers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But Index Ventures partner <a href=\"https://www.indexventures.com/team/jahanvi-sardana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jahanvi Sardana</a> has a reminder for all those founders worried about finding TAM for their product or service: many startups have emerged from markets that, at the time, were essentially nonexistent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What was the market for search before Google?” Sardana asked the audience at TechCrunch’s 2025 All Stage event in Boston, held earlier this month. “What was the market for operating systems before Microsoft, or the market for cloud before Amazon?” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sardana compares TAM to surfing. Every few years, there are massive waves founders must ride — first came the internet, then the mobile wave, then the cloud, and now, she said, the biggest wave of all: artificial intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Have you shaped the right product to ride this wave?” she continued. “That’s what we call product market fit.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which TAM bucket are you in?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sardana places TAM into three buckets: known market, emerging market, and invisible market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first, known market, already exists, and it is when a founder seeks to replace a legacy incumbent and must prove to an investor why their startup idea is better. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everyone brushes their teeth,” she said. “You have to tell me why you’re building a better toothbrush.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The emerging market is when a certain sector of the market is using a product, and there is potential for it to go mainstream.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Think about non-alcoholic beer before it became cool,” Sardana said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there is the invisible market, which Sardana calls “the biggest trap,” and “also a little bit of a dark art.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The market doesn’t exist, and a founder has to essentially create the one and provide investors with evidence of how innovative they can be. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Think about smartphones in 2006, nobody knew they wanted them and they changed the world,” she said, later adding that “people don’t know what they’re looking for and sometimes you have to show them what’s possible.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The audience at All Stage, many of whom are early-stage founders, peppered Sardana with questions, largely about what investors want to see. For instance, do investors want to see a TAM slide in a pitch deck? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s OK to create that slide and talk about the math behind your TAM,”  Sardana said, though she added that sometimes investors get annoyed when founders rely too much on industry metrics rather than having their own unique insight. Sardana also cautioned founders not to rely too much on industry reports. If a founder is too dependent on an external service to dictate how they think about the market, it can signal that they haven’t thought deeply about the market they are trying to build in, she commented.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“How do you size the TAM in the marketplaces, especially big marketplaces?” one audience member asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, that question hurts, Sardana quipped. After all, Index once passed on Airbnb, having believed its TAM was too small. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reality is Airbnb created a whole new inventory, which is now bigger than some of the largest hotel brands, and that led to a big change in behavior on how people travel,” she said, adding that marketplace TAMs are tricky. “You want to focus on, again, what is unlocking supply, and once you unlock the supply, how will behavior change?” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The audience also asked Sardana what makes a company stand out to an investor like herself. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A tough one, Sardana said, but a really important one. Ultimately, if a founder can understand who the customer is and why they are willing to purchase their product, then a company should have no problem standing up to investors, she added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in the business of evaluating founders more than markets or products or anything else,” she said. “When you talk about your market, it’s really a lens on your ambition.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Zhao contributed to several of OpenAI’s largest breakthroughs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4, and the company’s first AI reasoning model, o1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m excited to share that Shengjia Zhao will be the Chief Scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs,” Zuckerberg said in a <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DMiwjXJSYCd?xmt=AQF0HI08Kz8AqNItYYFe01Q_5l6uKht16W7cSsKSjxjJAA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on Threads</a> Friday. “Shengjia co-founded the new lab and has been our lead scientist from day one. Now that our recruiting is going well and our team is coming together, we have decided to formalize his leadership role.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zhao will set a research agenda for MSL under the leadership of Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of Scale AI who was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/scale-ai-confirms-significant-investment-from-meta-says-ceo-alexandr-wang-is-leaving/\">recently hired to lead the new unit</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wang, who does not have a research background, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/can-scale-ai-and-alexandr-wang-reignite-metas-ai-efforts/\">was viewed as a somewhat unconventional choice</a> to lead an AI lab. The addition of Zhao, who is a reputable research leader known for developing frontier AI models, rounds out the leadership team. To further fill out the unit, Meta has hired several high-level researchers from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Safe Superintelligence, Apple, and Anthropic, as well as pulling researchers from Meta’s existing Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab and generative AI unit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerberg notes in his post that Zhao has pioneered several breakthroughs, including a “new scaling paradigm.” The Meta CEO is likely referencing Zhao’s work on OpenAI’s reasoning model, o1, in which he is listed as a foundational contributor alongside OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. Meta currently doesn’t offer a competitor to o1, so AI reasoning models are a key area of focus for MSL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Information reported in June that <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-hires-four-openai-researchers?rc=dp0mql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Zhao would be joining Meta Superintelligence Labs</a>, alongside three other influential OpenAI researchers — Jiahui Yu, Shuchao Bi, and Hongyu Ren. Meta has also recruited <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/meta-hires-key-openai-researcher-to-work-on-ai-reasoning-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trapit Bansal</a>, another OpenAI researcher who worked on AI reasoning models with Zhao, as well as three employees from OpenAI’s Zurich office who worked on multimodality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerberg has gone to great lengths to set MSL up for success. The Meta CEO has been on a recruiting spree to staff up his AI superintelligence lab, which has entailed sending personal emails to researchers and inviting prospects to his Lake Tahoe estate. Meta has reportedly offered some researchers eight- and nine-figure compensation packages, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-recruiting-mark-zuckerberg-sam-altman-140d5861?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhYlCQz6I7O3bBSCvr65nRBKlKY-LemkHL9X_xE2byDCqhQF89oRJKE7-4S5A%3D%3D&amp;gaa_ts=687e9892&amp;gaa_sig=MVoR4KgaPwnfqcwSe0U0AmsF7FfXjaD7jM8HPaId3kxDMubbq47E3_XX0t6LF8eN5heIHAoeFK7_2Sm-o9MvXQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some of which are “exploding offers”</a> that expire in a matter of days.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has also upped its investment in cloud computing infrastructure, which should help MSL conduct the massive training runs required to create competitive frontier AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2026, Zhao and MSL’s researchers should have access to<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\"> Meta’s 1 gigawatt cloud computing cluster, Prometheus,</a> located in Ohio. Once online, Meta will be one of the first technology companies with an AI training cluster of Prometheus’ size — 1 gigawatt is enough energy to power more than 750,000 homes. That should help Meta conduct the massive training runs required to create frontier AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the addition of Zhao, Meta now has two chief AI scientists, including Yann LeCun, the leader of Meta’s FAIR lab. Unlike MSL, FAIR is designed to focus on long-term AI research — techniques that may be used five to 10 years from now. How exactly Meta’s three AI units will work together remains to be seen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevertheless, Meta now seems to have a formidable AI leadership team to compete with OpenAI and Google.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to new data from market intelligence provider <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Similarweb</a>, AI platforms in June generated over 1.13 billion referrals to the top 1,000 websites globally, a figure that’s up 357% since June 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Google Search still accounts for the majority of traffic to these sites, accounting for 191 billion referrals during the same period of June 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One particular category of interest these days is news and media. Online publishers are seeing traffic declines and are preparing for a day they’re calling “Google Zero,” when <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google stops sending traffic to websites</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, The Wall Street Journal recently reported on data that showed how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/googles-ai-overviews-are-killing-traffic-for-publishers/\">AI overviews were killing traffic to news sites</a>. Plus, a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pew Research Center study</a> out this week found that in a survey of 900 U.S. Google users, 18% of some 69,000 searches showed AI Overviews, which led to users clicking links 8% of the time. When there was no AI summary, users clicked links nearly twice as much, or 15% of the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarweb found that June’s AI referrals to news and media websites were up 770% since June 2024. Some sites will naturally rank higher than others that are blocking access to AI platforms, as The New York Times does, as a result of its lawsuit with OpenAI over the use of its articles to train its models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the news media category, Yahoo led with 2.3 million AI referrals in June 2025, followed by Yahoo Japan (1.9M), Reuters (1.8M), The Guardian (1.7M), India Times (1.2M), and Business Insider (1.0M). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of methodology, Similarweb counts AI referrals as web referrals to a domain from an AI platform like ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, Claude, and Liner. ChatGPT dominates here, accounting for more than 80% of the AI referrals to the top 1,000 domains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s analysis also looked at other categories beyond news, like e-commerce, science and education, tech/search/social media, arts and entertainment, business, and others. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031349\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg 1534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=300,271 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=768,694 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=680,614 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=1200,1084 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=1280,1157 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=430,389 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=720,651 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=900,813 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=800,723 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=668,604 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=415,375 415w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=683,617 683w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=588,531 588w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/top-ai-referrals-june-2025.jpg?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Similarweb</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In e-commerce, Amazon was followed by Etsy and eBay when it came to those sites seeing the most referrals, at 4.5M, 2.0M, and 1.8M, respectively, during June. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among the top tech and social sites, Google, not surprisingly, was at the top of the list, with 53.1 million referrals in June, followed by Reddit (11.1M), Facebook (11.0M), Github (7.4M), Microsoft (5.1M), Canva (5.0M), Instagram (4.7M), LinkedIn (4.4M), Bing (3.1M), and Pinterest (2.5M). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The analysis excluded the OpenAI website because so many of its referrals were from ChatGPT, pointing to its services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across all other domains, the No. 1 site by AI referrals for each category included YouTube (31.2M), Research Gate (3.6M), Zillow (776.2K), Europa.eu (992.9K), Wikipedia (10.8M), NIH.gov (5.2M), Investing.com (1.2M), Home Depot (1.2M), Kayak (456.5K), and Zara (325.6K). </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the AI industry hasn’t yet figured out how to protect user privacy when it comes to these more sensitive conversations, because there’s no doctor-patient confidentiality when your doc is an AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec made these comments on a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYn8VKW6vXA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent episode</a> of Theo Von’s podcast, This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sam Altman | This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von #599\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYn8VKW6vXA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to a question about how AI works with today’s legal system, Altman said one of the problems of not yet having a legal or policy framework for AI is that there’s no legal confidentiality for users’ conversations. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People talk about the most personal sh** in their lives to ChatGPT,” Altman said. “People use it — young people, especially, use it — as a therapist, a life coach; having these relationship problems and [asking] ‘what should I do?’ And right now, if you talk to a therapist or a lawyer or a doctor about those problems, there’s legal privilege for it. There’s doctor-patient confidentiality, there’s legal confidentiality, whatever. And we haven’t figured that out yet for when you talk to ChatGPT.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This could create a privacy concern for users in the case of a lawsuit, Altman added, because OpenAI would be legally required to produce those conversations today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that’s very screwed up. I think we should have the same concept of privacy for your conversations with AI that we do with a therapist or whatever — and no one had to think about that even a year ago,” Altman said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company understands that the lack of privacy could be a blocker to broader user adoption. In addition to AI’s demand for so much online data during the training period, it’s being asked to produce data from users’ chats in some legal contexts. Already, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has been fighting a court order</a> in its lawsuit with The New York Times, which would require it to save the chats of hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users globally, excluding those from ChatGPT Enterprise customers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement on its website, OpenAI said it’s appealing this order, which it called “an overreach.” If the court could override OpenAI’s own decisions around data privacy, it could open the company to further demand for legal discovery or law enforcement purposes. Today’s tech companies are regularly subpoenaed for user data in order to aid in criminal prosecutions. But in more recent years, there have been additional concerns about digital data as laws began limiting access to previously established freedoms, like a woman’s right to choose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, for example, customers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/27/consumers-swap-period-tracking-apps-in-search-of-increased-privacy-following-roe-v-wade-ruling/\">began switching to more private period-tracking apps</a> or to Apple Health, which encrypted their records. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman asked the podcast host about his own ChatGPT usage, as well, given that Von said he didn’t talk to the AI chatbot much due to his own privacy concerns.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it makes sense … to really want the privacy clarity before you use [ChatGPT] a lot — like the legal clarity,” Altman said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Catwatchful relied on Firebase to host and store vast amounts of data stolen from thousands of phones compromised by its spyware.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve investigated these reported Firebase operations and suspended them for violating our terms of service,” Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez told TechCrunch in an email this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked by TechCrunch, Google would not say why it took a month to investigate and suspend the operation’s Firebase account. The company’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/terms/aup?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">own terms of use</a> broadly prohibit its customers from hosting malicious software or spyware operations on its platforms. As a for-profit company, Google has a commercial interest in retaining customers who pay for its services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of Friday, Catwatchful is no longer functioning nor does it appear to transmit or receive data, according to a network traffic analysis of the spyware carried out by TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Catwatchful was an Android-specific spyware that presented itself as a child-monitoring app “undetectable” to the user. Much like other phone spyware apps, Catwatchful required its customers to physically install it on a person’s phone, which usually requires prior knowledge of their passcode. These monitoring apps are often called<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#stalkerware\"> “stalkerware” (or spouseware)</a> for their propensity to be used for non-consensual surveillance of spouses and romantic partners, which is illegal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once installed, the app was designed to stay hidden from the victim’s home screen, and upload the victim’s private messages, photos, location data, and more to a web dashboard viewable by the person who planted the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch first learned of Catwatchful in mid-June after <a href=\"https://ericdaigle.ca/posts/taking-over-60k-spyware-user-accounts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">security researcher Eric Daigle identified a security bug</a> that was exposing the spyware operation’s back-end database.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bug allowed unauthenticated access to the database, meaning no passwords or credentials were needed to see the data inside. The database contained more than 62,000 Catwatchful customer email addresses and plaintext passwords, as well as records on 26,000 victim devices compromised by the spyware. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The data also exposed the administrator behind the operation, a Uruguay-based developer called Omar Soca Charcov. TechCrunch contacted Charcov to ask if he was aware of the security lapse, or if he planned to notify affected individuals about the breach. Charcov did not respond. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With no clear indication that Charcov would disclose the breach, TechCrunch provided a copy of the Catwatchful database to <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/Catwatchful\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Catwatchful is the latest in a long list of surveillance operations that have experienced a data breach in recent years, in large part due to shoddy coding and poor cybersecurity practices. Catwatchful is by TechCrunch’s count <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/\">the fifth spyware operation this year</a> to have spilled users’ data, and the most recent entry in a list of more than two-dozen known spyware operations since 2017 that have exposed their banks of data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As we noted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/data-breach-reveals-catwatchful-stalkerware-spying-on-thousands-android-phones/\">in our previous story</a>: Android users can identify if the Catwatchful spyware is installed, even if the app is hidden, by dialing <strong>543210</strong> into your Android phone app’s keypad and pressing the call button. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Remember to have<a href=\"https://stopstalkerware.org/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> a safety plan in place</a> before removing spyware from your phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-paragraph\">—</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>If you or someone you know needs help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) provides 24/7 free, confidential support to victims of domestic abuse and violence.

So far, it is only allowed to do that for employees. Business Insider reports that the company plans to send invites to Tesla owners to test the service; on Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk said on a conference call that it is in the process of getting regulatory approval in California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push into California comes as the DMV is currently trying to <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/california-dmv-claims-tesla-misled-drivers-driving-capabilities-looks-suspend-business-30-days/17234677/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stop Tesla from selling vehicles</a> in the state as part of a years-long lawsuit over the promises the company has made about its cars’ self-driving abilities. Tesla is also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/22/tesla-california-dmv-autopilot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">currently on trial in a lawsuit</a> over deaths related to the use of its less-capable driver assistance system, Autopilot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has been running an invite-only version of its robotaxi service in Austin since June 22. It’s so far been a far cry from what Musk has spent years teasing. The service is mostly limited to Austin’s downtown core and main corridors. There is a safety operator in the front passenger seat who can intervene if the car is about to do something wrong or dangerous. While the service launched with around 10 vehicles, it’s not clear how many Model Y SUVs are in operation in the city, nor is it clear how many times those safety operators have had to intervene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s a long way from the “general solution” that Musk said Tesla was working on for a decade. Musk was once so confident in the autonomous software Tesla was developing that he said it would take a car from Los Angeles to New York — a stunt that never happened. Musk said this week that Tesla is also trying to expand to Florida and Arizona. TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/tesla-is-already-trying-to-expand-its-robotaxi-service-to-arizona/\">reported earlier this month</a> that Tesla had begun the required certification process to test and operate with and without a driver in Arizona.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple is expanding its age-rating system for apps. The company on Thursday <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ks775ehf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> it has updated its age-rating system to add 13+, 16+, and 18+ ratings to the existing slate of 4+ and 9+ ratings, and remove the 12+ and 17+ age ranges. In addition, app developers will need to answer a new set of age-rating questions to help identify the sensitive content in their app. Developers will also be able to update their apps’ age ratings to one of the new options, if needed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says it has automatically updated all apps and games across the App Store to align with the new system, which is available in the beta versions of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26. The public betas went live yesterday, and the general release will roll out this September to all customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the updated system, developers will need to inform Apple about their in-app controls and app capabilities, answer questions about medical and wellness topics, and disclose whether their app or game contains violent themes. Apple will then calculate the appropriate age rating, which developers can view and modify in App Store Connect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ratings are intended to offer parents more specific guidance about the apps their kids want to download, and will prevent kids from installing apps that exceed their age range. On Apple’s side, the App Store also won’t feature certain apps in areas like the editorial stories, Today, Games, and Apps tabs if they’re not age-appropriate for the child using the device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expanded age ranges are part of a broader update around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/apple-introduces-new-child-safety-initiatives-including-an-age-checking-system-for-apps/\">child safety initiatives announced earlier this year.</a> For parents, Apple is making it easier to set up child accounts and share information about their kids’ ages. This data will be shared with app developers to help provide age-appropriate content. (Some of the changes for child accounts were first made available in the public beta of 18.4, out earlier this year.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">App Store product listings will also be updated to include more information to help guide guardians’ decisions about whether or not an app or game is right for their child or teen. For instance, guardians will be informed if the app features user-generated content or ads, both of which could expose younger children to adult content. Plus, they’ll be informed if an app offers built-in parental controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Increasing an app’s age rating could reduce its visibility and distribution, which could encourage app developers to introduce parental controls or other age-appropriate experiences. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes to the App Store arrive as legislative disputes grow at both the state and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/21/meta-require-apple-google-verify-users-ages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">federal</a> levels about how children should be protected online, with U.S. states introducing <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/child-online-safety-protections-laws-0ffb9308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new bills and laws</a> that would require app store operators to check kids’ ages to get parental consent for downloading apps. Apple and Google would prefer that the app makers themselves handle the age-verification process, but larger tech companies like Meta <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/15/meta-law-parental-controls-apple-google-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/21/meta-require-apple-google-verify-users-ages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lobbied</a> for app stores to do the verification.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s solution is a system that will protect the child’s personal information, like their birth date, by offering a developer API that gives them access to the age range information they need to customize their app experience appropriately. Because this information would be provided by the parent during the set-up of a new device, it’s more likely to be accurate than if kids entered their birthday or age into an app directly, as kids may lie about their age to access an app’s full experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, for this to work, developers will have to opt to integrate with the new API.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s a reasonable aspiration.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recall that Musk has made bold claims like this before.

The company said it had consulted with the EU extensively, but came to the conclusion that it would either have to alter its services to offer an ad service that “doesn’t work for advertisers or users,” or stop offering such ads altogether.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Once again, we’re seeing regulatory obligations effectively remove popular products and services from the market, reducing choice and competition,” Meta wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, another advertising giant that also <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/political-advertising-in-eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> it would stop selling political ads in the EU by October, raised similar points, arguing that the law brings significant operational challenges and legal uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the latest of a string of tussles between the EU and Big Tech as the bloc tries to rein in the influence and power of these platforms. Tech companies have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/meta-refuses-to-sign-eus-ai-code-of-practice/\">battling the EU’s AI Act</a>, its enforcement of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/\">competition rules</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/europes-dma-forces-meta-towards-less-personalized-ads/\">ad-tracking regulation</a>, and more.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Once a no-go zone for institutional investors, defense and resilience tech last year reached <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/defense-and-resilience-tech-reached-an-all-time-high-10-of-all-vc-funding-in-europe/\">an all-time high of 10% of all VC funding</a> in Europe, where nearly all of NIF’s backers are located.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This boom should have given NIF a first-mover advantage, but the fund was hampered by management challenges and a series of high-profile departures. After the 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague reaffirmed its importance last June, NIF is now emerging with an almost entirely new investment team. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While NIF originally had four partners and one managing partner, it is now composed of three partners. A person familiar with NIF said this flat, three-partner structure will remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two of the partners are new hires: Ulrich Quay and Sander Verbrugge, who will be based in Amsterdam. Quay, a German national, was most recently in charge of corporate investments as a vice president at BMW, where he previously founded and led corporate venture fund <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/bmw-i-ventures-announces-new-300-million-fund-to-invest-in-sustainable-technology/\">BMW i Ventures</a>. Verbrugge, who is Dutch and has a PhD in molecular biophysics, was previously a partner at deep tech VC fund Innovation Industries, which he joined after working at semiconductor design and manufacturing company NXP. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third partner is London-based VC Patrick Schneider-Sikorsky, who is the last remaining member of the original investment team.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the new hires, the fund announced the departure of founding team partner Kelly Chen, who tells TechCrunch that leaving was her decision and that she will be building a new venture. Chris O’Connor, another founding team partner, left NIF earlier this year with similar plans.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chen currently sits on the board of several startups backed by NIF but will transition her board responsibilities once her employment at the NIF has wrapped up, TechCrunch learned from its chief communications and marketing officer, Amalia Kontesi. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some observers wish the fund had deployed capital faster, Kontesi said NIF “is on track to meet [its] investing goals for the year.” Since its inception, NIF has made 19 investments: seven into funds such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/otb-ventures-deep-tech/\">OTB Ventures</a> and 12 into startups, including <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/05/31/space-forge-raises-30m-series-a-to-make-chip-materials-in-space/\">Space Forge</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/portugals-tekever-raises-74m-for-dual-use-drone-platform-deployed-to-ukraine/\">Tekever</a>, which make dual-use drones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adding new partners with industrial and scientific backgrounds, no matter how impressive, may not satisfy those who wish the fund could invest in Ukraine or pure defense, as opposed to dual use, in response to Russia’s war economy. But the NIF’s broader thesis is to “empower deep tech founders to address challenges in defence, security, and resilience.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, NIF has also ramped up its efforts on the defense side. Its team was heavily involved in the development of <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_236539.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NATO’s Rapid Adoption Action Plan</a>, aimed at accelerating the adoption and integration of new technological products for defense. NIF has also been building up its Mission Platform Group with strategic hires, including John Ridge, who was hired as chief adoption officer in 2024 to help portfolio startups navigate military procurement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for its new partners, they were once again hired through a process previously described by VC Michael Jackson as <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaeljacksonvc_yikes-the-nif-has-sadly-but-predictably-activity-7335946802615013378--Thd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">akin to “building a boy band.”</a> They weren’t teamed up based on shared history or chemistry, in other words; they were identified by NIF’s board of directors and approved by LPs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That process may be inevitable for an organization that now counts 24 countries as limited partners but is widely believed to be one reason the previous team didn’t gel. This time, all three partners got to meet throughout the recruitment process and spend time together to “ensure a smooth transition and to position the team for long-term success,” Kontesi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement shared exclusively with TechCrunch, NIF’s vice chair, Professor Fiona Murray, compared the organization to a startup. “We are proud of what we accomplished, but like any effective team we are learning, experimenting, improving: speeding up our processes, expanding our platform support for startups, doubling down on ecosystem building and more broadly recognizing the need to build the sector and the capital stack.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murray expressed pride in having brought together a qualified team that can collaborate effectively, creatively, and quickly. “They will enable us to move even more rapidly and decisively to drive the Alliance’s technological agenda and support the best founders across European ecosystems,” she previously wrote in a joint statement with NIF’s chair, Klaus Hommels. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hommels’ other activities as an investor have prompted questions <a href=\"https://www.ftm.eu/articles/nato-tech-fund-public-money-private-investors?share=DUMuuGSBFtnQJn3t0AwVmo79bwj7ve4C20sWZc7pHM6r7g4TNTNG80Bb4d57GcA%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about possible conflicts of interest</a>, but no change appears to have been made to his role during NIF’s recent LP meeting in Venice. Rather than dwelling further on its reorganization, NIF seems set on helping NATO become more resilient.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In this next phase,” NIF’s vice chair said, “you’ll see us refocus on DSR opportunities and emphasize building companies that can drive industrial scale and really support ecosystems across Europe.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It also lets customers see what their friends have ordered and bookmark places to try out. The app plays on how young people engage with content — through short-form videos and recommendations from friends. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McDaniel posted the video and went back to work. Fifteen minutes later, his sister texted him that their post was going viral. “We were at 20,000 views in 15 minutes,” McDaniel told TechCrunch. Excitement came, but then chaos ensued as “parts of our app started to break as we got more users.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The engineering team worked around the clock to keep BiteSight functional, while McDaniel took to making TikToks about the chaos, which ended up going viral, too. He said people loved the “authenticity” behind seeing what happens when “your app explodes overnight.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The video of McDaniel presenting this idea has since amassed <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@realeater.flou/video/7517648679847693623?_t=ZT-8yDFr8jRL0h&amp;_r=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">almost 4 million likes</a> on TikTok and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFjM5NM5Tj/?igsh=M2YxZDgzNDNzYnN2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a quarter of a million on Instagram</a>, joining a trend of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-startups-announce-new-funding-rounds-video-2025-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">young entrepreneurs using TikTok and Instagram Reels to gain traction and deal flow. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McDaniel told TechCrunch that the idea to make this video came after watching a friend partake in the same internet trend for his dating app. “It got over a million views, and he suggested I try it for BiteSight.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Twenty-four-year-old McDaniel said he, like many young people, realized he was eating too much takeout, ordering from the same three places because he couldn’t discover new restaurants on delivery apps. “I’d hit this wall of identical-looking restaurants with stock photos, and somehow every place had 4.6 stars.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He started keeping a spreadsheet of restaurants he’d found on Instagram and TikTok, tracking actual reviews, and seeing what his friends thought about said places. “When I realized other people were doing the exact same thing, my co-founder Zac and I decided to build something better: an app that actually reflects how we discover food today,” he said, referring to Zac Schulwolf, the company’s CTO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McDaniel is no stranger to the tech industry. He previously worked at General Atlantic, where one of his main focus areas was restaurant technology. He previously founded a payments company called Phly, led product for a recruitment software, and has even angel invested in a few companies, including the fintech Mercury. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He and Schulwolf, 25, spent over a year building BiteSight, including participation in Y Combinator’s Winter 2024 cohort. They then did a limited beta around New York University in April. In mid-May, the company launched an early version and did a bit of social media marketing. In June, they made their viral video.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What made our video stand out was that what we are building resonates,” said McDaniel, who is BiteSight’s CEO (also known as chief eating officer). He added that “it’s clear that consumers, and especially Gen Z, are ready for something that feels fresh and built for the way they engage.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the video, BiteSight briefly became No. 2 in the App Store’s Food and Beverage category, bypassing Uber Eats, Starbucks, and even McDonald’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McDaniel said the app also gained more than 100,000 new users, and though it is only available in New York at the moment, people in other cities started messaging for a nationwide release. On the restaurant side, McDaniel said everyone from small family-owned spots to chain restaurants has reached out to partner and, of course, “we’ve had a surge of investor interest from folks who see that this is where food delivery is going.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He declined to comment on the size of any upcoming funding deals, except to say he expects to have news to share soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, BiteSight has a lot of big, well-funded competition like DoorDash and Uber Eats. McDaniel believes, however, that being a startup in the age of AI will be to his advantage. For example, while most of its competitors needed hundreds of engineers in their early days, BiteSight can work with AI tools that perform 10x the work of a human for much less the cost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By using AI to avoid massive overhead and infrastructure costs, we can do much more with much less and pass on the savings to the small business owners and customers who need it most while still maintaining healthy margins,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What also differentiates BiteSight is its focus on food and video, rather than other categories at the moment. <br><br>“We’re trying to be the go-to app for the generation that discovers everything through social recommendations and short-form video.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Wildlife raised money from a multitude of VCs, including Benchmark.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his two years at Benchmark, Lazarte invested in recruiting and data labeling startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/mercor-an-ai-recruiting-startup-founded-by-21-year-olds-raises-100m-at-2b-valuation/\">Mercor</a>, AI video intelligence platform HeyGen, and AI infrastructure company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/decart-adds-another-32m-at-a-500m-valuation/\">Decart AI</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lazarte is leaving Benchmark to “build a new investment practice,” he wrote in the post. He had recently informed his portfolio companies about his plans to leave Benchmark, according to a source.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lazarte is the second investor to step down from Benchmark’s partnership this year.

And that includes spiking several manufacturing projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The semiconductor giant reported Thursday in its second-quarter earnings report that it will delay, and in some cases not move forward with, multiple manufacturing projects. Specifically, Intel said it was no longer going forward with its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland. Those projects included an assembly and testing facility in Poland and a chip factory in Germany. Both projects have been sitting in limbo since being suspended in 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/intel-plans-to-build-a-19-billion-chip-plant-in-germany/\">shortly after being announced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also plans to consolidate its test operations in Costa Rica and concentrate these operations to its sites in Vietnam and Malaysia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Unfortunately, the capacity investment we make over the last several years were well ahead of demand and were unwise and excessive,” Tan said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call. “Our factory footprint has become needlessly fragmented. Going forward, we will grow our capacity based solely on the volume commitments and deploy <mark class=\"has-inline-color\">capex lockstep</mark> with the tangible milestones, and not before.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intel also said it was going to further delay its $28 billion Ohio chip factory. The factory was initially supposed to open in 2025 and was already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/28/intel-delays-its-ohio-chip-factory-to-2030/\">delayed once this year in February.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second quarter was the first full quarter with Tan at the helm of Intel. He was named <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/intel-appoints-lip-bu-tan-as-its-next-ceo/\">CEO of the semiconductor company on March 12</a> and started the role a week later. Shortly after, Tan said his plan was to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/lip-bu-tan-says-intel-will-spin-off-non-core-units/\">eliminate inefficiencies</a> at the company by selling off its noncore units and streamlining operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have much work to do in building a clean and streamlined organization, which we have started in earnest, and it remain an area of focus for me during Q3,” Tan said on the Q2 earnings call. “Our goal is to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies and increase accountability at every level of the company.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also gave an update on its workforce, which has gone through several rounds of layoffs. Intel reduced its workforce by about 15% and plans to end the year with 75,000 employees, the company said. Intel was able to eliminate 50% of management layers through its recent layoffs, Tan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intel announced in June in an internal memo that it was going to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/intel-to-layoff-up-to-20-of-intel-foundry-workers/\">lay off 15% to 20%</a> of workers in its Intel Foundry unit, which designs and manufactures chips for external clients. The company had 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, according to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000050863/000005086325000009/intc-20241228.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">annual report</a> filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

While X’s system has been criticized for being too slow and unable to keep up with the massive amounts of misinformation that circulate on the platform, this same idea has since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/meta-drops-fact-checking-and-loosens-its-content-moderation-rules/\">been adopted by Meta</a> as a replacement for fact-checking. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now X intends to see if Community Notes could help identify the best posts, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starting today, the company says that a subset of Community Notes contributors will begin seeing a new callout in the product when a post is gaining attention in the form of Likes. Contributors will then be able to rate and provide feedback about the post, which will inform the algorithm if the post is being well-received by people with different perspectives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a href=\"https://x.com/CommunityNotes/status/1930634452046163986/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> on the Community Notes X account, the company explains the experiment could bring awareness to “what resonates broadly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People often feel the world is divided, yet Community Notes shows people can agree, even on contentious topics. This experimental new feature seeks to uncover ideas, insights, and opinions that bridge perspectives,” the post states. “Following the path we used to develop Community Notes, we’re building in public with a small pilot so that this concept can be shaped by the people. We look forward to learning and iterating with you all as we do with Community Notes every day.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Last month, Chime went public at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/chime-almost-died-in-2016-turned-down-by-100-vcs-today-it-ipod-at-14-5b/\">$14.5 billion valuation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kolodny, who appeared on the Forbes Midas List three years in a row, is still passionate about investing in tech solutions that help consumers maximize their resources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She recently led a $20 million Series A investment in <a href=\"https://www.meetalix.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alix</a>, a startup that leverages AI to automate the estate settlement process.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alix’s founder, Alexandra Mysoor, realized the burden of executing a family estate after she offered to help her best friend settle her late mother’s affairs. Mysoor told TechCrunch that it took her 900 hours and 18 months to complete tasks such as calling the bank to transfer assets, locating all the 401(k)s, canceling accounts, and distributing assets among family members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was shocked that this process was so hard,” Mysoor said. “It’s paper-driven. It’s archaic. You’re googling to-do lists that are not helpful. You’re calling attorneys who might do a sliver of the work, and they cost thousands and thousands of dollars.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That experience gave Mysoor the idea that some of the most labor-intensive aspects of trust administration, including scanning and extracting data from documents, pre-populating complex forms, and communications with banks, can now be handled by AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Kolodny met Mysoor and learned about the problem Alix was addressing, the issue resonated so deeply with the Midas List investor that she couldn’t get it out of her mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kolodny realized that even though economists are estimating that<a href=\"https://www.ml.com/articles/great-wealth-transfer-impact.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> trillions of dollars</a> will transfer to millennial and Gen Z generations over the next two decades, the paperwork surrounding estate settlement largely remains a burden on those grieving the loss of their parents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/empathy-raises-30m/\">Empathy</a> provide assistance with closing accounts as part of their bereavement support, Kolodny discovered that no companies offered comprehensive, start-to-finish estate settlement services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“How is it possible that there’s this messy problem that involves so much project management that there aren’t even meaningful services around?” Kolodny told TechCrunch. “It was this real aha moment for me. This is exactly the kind of problem that AI should be solving.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kolodny said that she believes Alix is among the first of many startups powered by AI that will democratize financial services and administrative processes, which were historically available only to the ultra-wealthy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alix’s fee structure is 1% of an estate’s value. However, for inheritances under $1 million, customers can expect to pay between $9,000 and $12,000, with the exact cost determined by the complexity of the estate.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
