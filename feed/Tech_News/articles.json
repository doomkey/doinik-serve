            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has ordered social media platforms to step up policing of deepfakes and other AI-generated impersonations, while sharply shortening the time they have to comply with takedown orders. It’s a move that could reshape how global tech firms moderate content in one of the world’s largest and fastest growing market for internet services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes, <a href=\"https://egazette.gov.in/(S(0ct2e1fwl2vycvmqacrzmxxm))/ViewPDF.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published</a> (PDF) on Tuesday as amendments to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">India’s 2021 IT Rules</a>, bring deepfakes under a formal regulatory framework, mandating the labelling and traceability of synthetic audio and visual content, while also slashing compliance timelines for platforms, including a three-hour deadline for official takedown orders and a two-hour window for certain urgent user complaints.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s importance as a digital market amplifies the impact of the new rules. With over a billion internet users and a predominantly young population, the South Asian nation is a critical market for platforms like Meta and YouTube, making it likely that compliance measures adopted in India will influence global product and moderation practices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the amended rules, social media platforms that allow users to upload or share audio-visual content must require disclosures on whether material is synthetically generated, deploy tools to verify those claims, and ensure that deepfakes are clearly labelled and embedded with traceable provenance data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Certain categories of synthetic content — including deceptive impersonations, non-consensual intimate imagery, and material linked to serious crimes — are barred outright in the rules. Non-compliance, particularly in cases flagged by authorities or users, can expose companies to greater legal liability by jeopardising their safe-harbour protections under Indian law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rules lean heavily on automated systems to meet those obligations. Platforms are expected to deploy technical tools to verify user disclosures, identify, and label deepfakes, and prevent the creation or sharing of prohibited synthetic content in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The amended IT Rules mark a more calibrated approach to regulating AI-generated deepfakes,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner at New Delhi-based policy consulting firm The Quantum Hub. “The significantly compressed grievance timelines — such as the two- to three-hour takedown windows — will materially raise compliance burdens and merit close scrutiny, particularly given that non-compliance is linked to the loss of safe harbour protections.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aprajita Rana, a partner at AZB &amp; Partners, a leading Indian corporate law firm, said the rules now focus on AI-generated audio-visual content rather than all online information, while carving out exceptions for routine, cosmetic or efficiency-related uses of AI. However, she cautioned that the requirement for intermediaries to remove content within three hours once they become aware of it departs from established free-speech principles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The law, however, continues to require intermediaries to remove content upon being aware or receiving actual knowledge, that too within three hours,” Rana said, adding that the labelling requirements would apply across formats to curb the spread of child sexual abuse material and deceptive content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New Delhi-based digital advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation <a href=\"https://x.com/internetfreedom/status/2021229955217228082\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> the rules risk accelerating censorship by drastically compressing takedown timelines, leaving little scope for human review and pushing platforms toward automated over-removal. In a statement posted on X, the group also raised concerns about the expansion of prohibited content categories and provisions that allow platforms to disclose the identities of users to private complainants without judicial oversight.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These impossibly short timelines eliminate any meaningful human review,” the group said, warning that the changes could undermine free-speech protections and due process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two industry sources told TechCrunch that the amendments followed a limited consultation process, with only a narrow set of suggestions reflected in the final rules. While the Indian government appears to have taken on board proposals to narrow the scope of information covered — focusing on AI-generated audio-visual content rather than all online material — other recommendations were not adopted. The scale of changes between the draft and final rules warranted another round of consultation to give companies clearer guidance on compliance expectations, the sources said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Government takedown powers have already been a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/india/india-accused-of-censorship-for-blocking-social-media-criticism-amid-covid-surge-11619435006\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">point of contention</a> in India. Social media platforms and civil-society groups have long criticized the <a href=\"https://x.com/apar1984/status/1757431828124995804\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">breadth and opacity of content removal orders</a>, and even Elon Musk’s X <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/x-sues-india-over-unrestrained-censorship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">challenged New Delhi in court</a> over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/elon-musk-x-to-withhold-specific-accounts-and-tweets-in-india-to-comply-with-executive-orders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">directives to block or remove posts</a>, arguing that they amounted to overreach and lacked adequate safeguards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta, Google, Snap, X, and the Indian IT ministry did not respond to requests for comments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest changes come just months after the Indian government, in October 2025, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/india-limits-content-takedown-powers-fewer-officials-after-spat-with-musks-x-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reduced</a> the number of officials authorized to order content removals from the internet in response to a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/x-says-will-fight-indian-court-ruling-on-content-takedown-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legal challenge by X</a> over the scope and transparency of takedown powers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The amended rules will come into effect on February 20, giving platforms little time to adjust compliance systems. The rollout coincides with India’s hosting of the <a href=\"https://impact.indiaai.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Impact Summit in New Delhi</a> from February 16 to 20, which is expected to draw <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">senior global technology executives</a> and policymakers to the country.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://entire.io\">Entire</a>, has raised $60 million at a $300 million valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Entire offers an open source tool to help developers better manage code written by AI agents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Entire’s tech has three components. One is a git-compatible database to unify the AI-produced code. Git is a distributed version control system popular with enterprises and used by open source sites like GitHub and GitLab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another component is what it calls “a universal semantic reasoning layer” intended to allow multiple AI agents to work together. The final piece is an AI-native user interface designed with agent-to-human collaboration in mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first product Entire is releasing is an open-source tool it calls Checkpoints that automatically pairs every bit of software the agent submits for use in a software project with the context that created it, including prompts and transcripts. The idea is to allow the human developer to review, search, and perhaps even learn from why the AI did what it did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Entire hopes to help developers better deal with the large volumes of software created by AI coding agents. Popular open-source projects are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/4129056/is-ai-killing-open-source.html\">particularly overwhelmed these days with suggested code contributions</a> that may or may not be AI slop — meaning poorly designed and possibly unusable code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dohmke explains in the press release: “We are living through an agent boom, and now massive volumes of code are being generated faster than any human could reasonably understand. The truth is, our manual system of software production — from issues, to git repositories, to pull requests, to deployment — was never designed for the era of AI in the first place.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dohmke was CEO of Microsoft’s GitHub for four years, leaving in August 2025 to found a startup, he said in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/ashtom/status/1954920157853172064\">post</a> on X at the time.

Paying subscribers increased by 10% to 290 million in the quarter. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify said the “Wrapped” campaign resulted in more than 300 million engaged users and 630 million shares on social media in 56 languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revenue came in at €4.53 billion ($5.39 billion), about 7% more than a year earlier, thanks to an 8% increase in subscription revenue.

Gross margin, an important metric investors watch for indications of improvements to Spotify’s profitability, improved by 83 basis points to a record high of 33.1% as the company sold more ads for podcasts and music.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The solid performance comes as Spotify’s new co-CEOs Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/spotifys-founder-and-ceo-daniel-ek-is-stepping-down/\">take over</a> the reins from co-founder Daniel Ek, and they will now oversee a business that has far outgrown what it initially set out to do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After launching as a music streaming pure-play, Spotify has expanded its remit to include podcasts, audiobooks, and even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/spotify-ventures-into-physical-book-sales-adds-new-audiobook-features/\">physical bookstores</a>.

It perhaps showcases how the size of early-stage rounds has dramatically increased in the age of AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ben Sun, a co-founder and general partner at Primary Ventures, told TechCrunch the average check size for this fund will range from $5 million to $10 million, and that he hopes the firm will invest in 40 to 50 companies over the course of three years. He said the fund will also go as early as pre-seed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fund will also continue to spread its investments nationwide. Primary is one of New York’s most well-known venture firms, and at one point, most of its investments were focused in the Big Apple. Sun said the location thesis has changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm, which overall focuses on early-stage investing, has now done deals in Chicago, Seattle, Virginia, and D.C. “The talent, the founder, and the startups are happening everywhere,” he said. “The potential outcomes are so much bigger than they’ve ever been.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He sees seed investing as headed toward its own asset class, especially as the quality of talent and their startups continue to rise, paired with tech’s current transformation. Firms are competing, after all, to find the hottest deals. “I think [a fund of this size] allows you to go in and compete and bring more resources to the table to work with the best founders and opportunities.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sequoia also recently raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/sequoia-unveils-950m-in-new-early-stage-funds-as-it-strives-to-be-only-as-good-as-our-next-investment/\">$200 million seed fund, </a>as did UnCorck Capital, which announced <span>a </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uncork-capital-raises-300-million-to-back-the-next-generation-of-category-defining-companies-302443713.html\"><span>$2</span>25 million seed fund</a> earlier last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Primary calls itself a generalist, Sun said the firm has sector specialists, each with their own focus. He likes consumer, but also has investors focused on vertical AI, fintech, healthcare, enterprise, cybersecurity, and infrastructure. “We pretty much cover probably 80% or 90% of the seed sector activities out there.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fund V has already invested in three companies.

His friends were coordinating deals on WhatsApp or storing critical information in PDFs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There was no unified data layer, no consistent modeling, and no easy way to reason about risk, liquidity, or execution end to end,” Mohamed continued. “Decisions involving millions of dollars were being made without anything resembling a modern intelligence stack. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, he left his job at Boston Consulting Group to strike out on his own.

Even after a deal has been brokered, Smart Bricks uses fresh data to continuously update the deal, monitor performance, simulate refinancing, and recommend actions as the market changes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091105\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png 1995w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=1200,651 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=1280,695 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=430,233 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=720,391 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=900,489 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=800,434 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=1536,834 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=668,363 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=1137,617 1137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=708,384 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced Tuesday a $5 million pre-seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz.

The startup is also currently partaking in a16z’s prestigious Speedrun program. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mohamed met the team at a16z last year while exhibiting at TechCrunch Disrupt. At the time, he said, the company was still under the radar, but the investment from a16z has allowed them to scale. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh capital will be used to expand the product’s infrastructure into additional markets (right now it just operates in the U.S., UK, and the UAE, the latter of which is Mohamed’s home country). The money will also go toward product advancement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mohamed said the last wave of proptech didn’t focus enough on the sector’s true bottleneck: cognition and execution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Real estate transactions are slow and opaque because the reasoning lives in people’s heads and the process spans too many disconnected systems,” he said, adding that the company is betting that the next era of proptech looks like what happened in the public markets — “intelligence layers, automated execution, and continuous decision-making powered by software,” he continued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Smart Bricks is building the AI infrastructure that allows real estate to operate more like a modern financial system, even across borders,” Mohamed said</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in this space include reAlpha and RoofStock. Mohammed said Smart Bricks is different because others are building on top of a tech stack, but this product has built the stack itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re closer to what Bloomberg did for public markets or what algorithmic trading platforms did for equities than to a consumer property portal,” he said. “The goal is not to show more options, but to enable better outcomes through autonomous reasoning systems.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While the company has historically built a strong customer base in media, entertainment, and advertising –  including a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.adobe.com/news/2025/12/adobe-and-runway-partner\">recent partnership with Adobe</a> – a spokesperson told TechCrunch that Runway is increasingly seeing adoption in gaming and robotics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Runway’s shift comes amid intensifying competition among labs pursuing world models. Rivals include Fei-Fei Li’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\">World Labs</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/i-built-marshmallow-castles-in-googles-new-ai-world-generator-project-genie/\">Google DeepMind</a>, both of which recently made their models publicly available. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding follows the release of Gen 4.5, Runway’s latest video generation model. Gen 4.5 allows users to generate high-definition videos from text prompts and introduces native audio, longform, multi-shot generation capabilities, character consistency, and advanced editing tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The model has earned Runway significant credibility within the AI industry after outperforming video generation offerings from both Google and OpenAI on several benchmarks — a milestone that likely factored into investor interest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond model development, Runway has also been expanding its infrastructure. The company recently signed a deal with CoreWeave to expand its compute capacity, a move that may have helped reassure investors about Runway’s ability to operate in a highly compute-intensive space. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, Runway plans to use the new capital to rapidly expand its roughly 140-person team across research, engineering, and go-to-market, according to a company spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was led by General Atlantic with participation from Nvidia, Fidelity Management &amp; Research, AllianceBernstein, Adobe Ventures, Mirae Asset, Emphatic Capital, Felicis, Premji, and AMD Ventures.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s that AI will save you from it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the version the industry has spent the last three years selling to millions of nervous people who are eager to buy it. Yes, some white-collar jobs will disappear. But for most other roles, the argument goes, AI is a force multiplier. You become a more capable, more indispensable lawyer, consultant, writer, coder, financial analyst — and so on. The tools work for you, you work less hard, everybody wins.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it\">new study</a> published in Harvard Business Review follows that premise to its actual conclusion, and what it finds there isn’t a productivity revolution. It finds companies are at risk of becoming burnout machines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of what they describe as “in-progress research,” UC Berkeley researchers spent eight months inside a 200-person tech company watching what happened when workers genuinely embraced AI. What they found across more than 40 “in-depth” interviews was that nobody was pressured at this company. Nobody was told to hit new targets. People just started doing more because the tools made more feel doable. But because they could do these things, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees’ to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As one engineer told them, “You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less. But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over on the tech industry forum Hacker News, one commenter had the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945755\">same reaction</a>, writing, “I feel this. Since my team has jumped into an AI everything working style, expectations have tripled, stress has tripled and actual productivity has only gone up by maybe 10%. It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s fascinating and also alarming. The argument about AI and work has always stalled on the same question — are the gains real? But too few have stopped to ask what happens when they are.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers’ new findings aren’t entirely novel. A separate trial last summer found experienced developers using AI tools took <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/\">19% longer on tasks</a> while believing they were 20% faster. Around the same time, a National Bureau of Economic Research study tracking AI adoption across thousands of workplaces found that productivity gains amounted to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w33777\">just 3% in time savings</a>, with no significant impact on earnings or hours worked in any occupation. Both studies have gotten picked apart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This one may be harder to dismiss because it doesn’t challenge the premise that AI can augment what employees can do on their own. It confirms it, then shows where all that augmentation actually leads, which is “fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,” according to the researchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry bet that helping people do more would be the answer to everything, but it may turn out to be the beginning of a different problem entirely. The research is worth reading, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company has signed up more than 2,600 business customers throughout the U.K. on the promise that buying energy from its utility division can save them up to 30% on their energy bills.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup recently closed an oversubscribed $75 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from AlbionVC, Allianz, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Revent, Schroders Capital, and Voyager Ventures, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round values Tem at more than $300 million, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. The startup plans to use the funding to help expand to Australia and the U.S., starting with Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in a nice position where we kind of have control over our own profitability. So I could have chosen not to raise at all and had a lovely, nice bootstrap business in some ways,” Joe McDonald, co-founder and CEO of Tem, told TechCrunch. “Well, we’re not that kind of business. We know what we want to achieve as someone who wants to go public over the years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tem is a classic marketplace play, matching electricity generators with consumers. The company intentionally started by focusing almost exclusively on renewable energy generators and small businesses to fill both sides of the ledger. “The more decentralized and the more distributed, the better it is for the algorithms,” McDonald said. “But this works all the way up to enterprise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s customers include fast-fashion retailer Boohoo Group, soft drink company Fever-Tree, and Newcastle United FC. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Tem is running what amounts to two different businesses. One, called Rosso, is the transaction engine that matches suppliers with buyers. Here, machine learning algorithms and LLMs help predict supply and demand. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal with Rosso, McDonald said, is to cut costs by eliminating several layers that are present in current energy markets. “In each of them, you’ve got different teams doing different jobs, taking different levels of profit from back office to trading, trading desks to other trading desks, and probably five to six intermediaries in total that enable the flow of money to move from one side to the other,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With AI, he said, “you now have an opportunity to replace the humans, the labor costs, and the disparate systems into one single transaction infrastructure.” The goal is to make the price that customers pay for electricity closer to the wholesale cost.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other part of Tem, called RED, is a “neo-utility” built to prove the value of Rosso. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we first started, we tried to sell our infrastructure to the energy companies, and we got nowhere,” he said. RED is currently the only utility using Rosso, and McDonald said its growth has pushed the company to prioritize it over opening Rosso to others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At some point, though, Tem plans to allow other utilities in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In reality, it doesn’t matter how good [RED] is; it’s not going to get above a 40% market share. And it shouldn’t, because that becomes a monopoly in itself. So, me, I’d much rather go to get access to all the transaction flow,” McDonald said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Long term, we really don’t mind who owns the customer, who owns the generation as long as our infrastructure is being used,” he said. “This is just an infrastructure play in the same way AWS was, or Stripe was.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Ahmedabad City Crime Branch has become the first police unit in India to integrate Aadhaar-based offline verification with PATHIK, a guest-monitoring platform launched by the police department, aimed at hotels and guest accommodations to record visitors’ information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UIDAI has also positioned the new Aadhaar app as a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/UIDAI/status/2019757027191582882\">digital visiting card</a> for meetings and networking, allowing users to share selected personal details via a QR code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Officials at the launch in New Delhi said these latest efforts are part of a broader effort to replace photocopies and manual ID checks with consent-based, offline verification. The approach, they argued, is meant to give users more control over which specific identity information they want to share, while enabling verification at scale without having to query Aadhaar’s central database.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-early-uptake-on-top-of-massive-scale\">Early uptake on top of massive scale</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While UIDAI formally launched the new Aadhaar app last month, it had been in testing since earlier in 2025. Estimates from Appfigures show that the app, which appeared in app stores toward the end of 2025, quickly overtook the older mAadhaar app in monthly downloads. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Combined monthly installs of Aadhaar-related apps rose from close to 2 million in October to nearly 9 million in December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new app is being layered onto an identity system that already operates at enormous scale considering India’s population. Figures published on<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://uidai.gov.in/aadhaar_dashboard/\"> UIDAI’s public dashboard</a> show that Aadhaar has issued more than 1.4 billion identity numbers and handles roughly 2.5 billion authentication transactions each month, alongside tens of billions of electronic “know your customer” checks since its launch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift toward offline verification does not replace this infrastructure so much as extending it, moving Aadhaar from a largely backend verification tool into a more visible and everyday interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the app’s launch, UIDAI officials said the move toward offline verification was intended to address long-standing risks <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/28/india-rajasthan-government-jan-aadhaar-bug-fix/\">associated with physical photocopies and screenshots of Aadhaar documents</a>, which have often been collected, stored, and circulated with little oversight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion comes at a time of regulatory changes, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/india-expands-aadhaar-authentication-for-businesses-raising-privacy-concerns/\">easing restrictions</a>, and a<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://uidai.gov.in/images/OVSE_Playbook.pdf\"> new framework</a> (PDF), with UIDAI now allowing some public and private organizations to verify Aadhaar credentials without querying the central database. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-consent-accountability-and-unresolved-risks\">Consent, accountability, and unresolved risks</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Civil liberties and digital rights groups say those legal changes do not resolve Aadhaar’s deeper structural risks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Raman Jit Singh Chima, senior international counsel and Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, said the expansion of Aadhaar into offline and private-sector settings introduces new threats, particularly at a time when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/india-digital-data-privacy-bill/\">India’s data protection framework</a> is still being put in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chima questioned the timing of the rollout, arguing that the federal government should have waited for India’s Data Protection Board to be established first, and allow for independent review and wider consultation with affected communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fact that this has gone ahead at this point of time seems to indicate a preference to continue the expansion of the use of Aadhaar, even if it is unclear in terms of the further risks that it might pose to the system, as well as to the data of Indians,” Chima told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indian legal advocacy groups also point to unresolved implementation failures. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prasanth Sugathan, legal director at New Delhi-based digital rights group SFLC.in, said that while UIDAI has framed the app as a tool for citizen empowerment, it does little to address persistent problems, such as inaccuracies in the Aadhaar database, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/security-bug-in-indias-income-tax-portal-exposed-taxpayers-sensitive-data/\">security lapses</a>, and poor mechanisms for redress, which have disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also cited a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cag-report-uidai-audit-aadhaar-data-7857808/\">2022 report</a> by India’s Comptroller and Auditor General, which found UIDAI had failed to meet certain compliance standards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Such issues can often result in disenfranchisement of people, especially those who were meant to be benefited by such systems,” Sugathan told TechCrunch, adding that it remains unclear how data shared through the new app would prevent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/13/aadhaar-leak-pm-kisan/\">breaches or leaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Campaigners associated with Rethink Aadhaar, a civil society campaign focused on Aadhaar-related rights and accountability, argue that the offline verification system risks reintroducing private-sector use of Aadhaar in ways the Supreme Court has already explicitly barred. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shruti Narayan and John Simte of the group said enabling private entities to routinely rely on Aadhaar for verification amounts to “Aadhaar creep”, normalizing its use across social and economic life despite a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sflc.in/key-highlights-aadhaar-judgment/\">2018 judgment</a> that struck down provisions allowing private actors to use Aadhaar to verify people’s information. They warned that consent in such contexts is often illusory, particularly in situations involving hotels, housing societies, or delivery workers, while India’s data protection law <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/india-data-law-surveillance-privacy-big-tech-data-protection-press-freedom/a-74923737\">remains largely untested</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Together, the new app, regulatory changes, and expanding ecosystem are shifting Aadhaar from a background identity utility into a visible layer of daily life that is increasingly hard to avoid. As India doubles down on Aadhaar, governments and tech companies are watching closely, attracted by the promise of population-scale identity checks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian IT ministry and UIDAI CEO did not respond to requests for comments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Riders will initially hail rides directly through the Waymo app. Once the service expands, Waymo will also make its self-driving vehicles available through the Lyft app. Lyft has said it will handle fleet services, such as vehicle readiness and maintenance, charging infrastructure, and depot operations, through its wholly owned subsidiary Flexdrive.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has accelerated its robotaxi expansion and today operates commercial services in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Phoenix. It also has driverless test fleets in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company tends to follow the same rollout strategy in every new market, starting with a small fleet of vehicles that are manually driven to map the city. The autonomous vehicles are then tested with a human safety operator in the driver’s seat. Eventually, the company conducts driverless testing, often allowing employees to hail rides, before launching a robotaxi service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is the most-subscribed creator on YouTube, with over 466 million subscribers, but his ambitions stretch beyond his over-the-top videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,” the 27-year-old <a href=\"https://x.com/MrBeast/status/2020910218360782929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a>. “I want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This acquisition makes sense, considering that a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/mrbeast-reportedly-plans-to-launch-a-phone-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">leaked pitch document</a> from last year showed this was an area of interest for Beast Industries.

What’s going to happen to all these companies? What’s AI going to do with all these companies?’ For us, it’s just increasing the usage,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be sure, he also wants to distance Databricks from the SaaS label, given that private markets value it as an AI company. Databricks on Monday also officially closed on its massive, previously announced $5 billion raise <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/databricks-raises-4b-at-134b-valuation-as-its-ai-business-heats-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">at a $134 billion valuation</a>, and nabbed a $2 billion loan facility as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the company is straddling both worlds. Databricks is still best known as a cloud data warehouse provider. A data warehouse is where enterprises store massive amounts of data to analyze for business insights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ghodsi called out, in particular, one AI product that’s driving usage of its data warehouse: its LLM user interface named Genie.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Genie is an example of how a SaaS business can <a href=\"https://x.com/buccocapital/status/2019598551228223526\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">replace its user interface</a> with natural language. For instance, he uses it to ask why warehouse usage and revenue spike on particular days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just a few years ago, such a request required writing queries in a specific technical language, or having a special report programmed. Today, any product with an LLM interface can be used by anyone, Ghodsi noted. Genie is one reason for the company’s usage growth numbers, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The threat of AI to SaaS isn’t, as <a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2019494196953154011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one AI VC jokingly tweeted</a>, that enterprises will rip out their SaaS “systems of record” to replace them with vibe-coded homegrown versions. Systems of record store critical business data, whether it’s on sales, customer support, or finance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Why would you move your system of record? You know, it’s hard to move it,” Ghodsi said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The model makers aren’t offering databases to store that data and become systems of record anyway. Instead, they hope to replace the user interface with natural language for human use, or APIs or other plug-ins for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So the threat to SaaS businesses, Ghodsi says, is that people no longer spend their careers becoming masters of a particular product: Salesforce specialists, or ServiceNow, or SAP. Once the interface is just language, the products become invisible, like plumbing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Millions of people around the world got trained on those user interfaces. And so that was the biggest moat that those businesses have,” Ghodsi warned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SaaS companies that embrace the new LLM interface could grow, as Databricks is doing. But it also opens up possibilities for AI-native competitors to offer alternatives that work better with AI and agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Databricks created its Lakebase database designed for agents. He’s seeing early traction. “In its eight months that we’ve had it in the market, it’s done twice as much revenue as our data warehouse had when it was eight months old. Okay, obviously, that’s like comparing toddlers,” Ghodsi says. “But this is a toddler that’s twice as big.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, now that Databricks has closed on its massive funding round, Ghodsi tells us that the company is not immediately working on another raise, nor prepping for an IPO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now is not a great time to go public,” Ghodsi said. “I just wanted to be really well capitalized” should the markets go “south” again as they did in the 2022 downturn, when interest rates rose sharply after years of near-zero rates. A thick bank account “protects us, gives us many, many years of runway,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The firm is seeking recognition of its prior use and relief to prevent further confusion, along with ₹10 million (about $110,000) in damages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic Software founder and director Mohammad Ayyaz Mulla told TechCrunch that the Indian company was not seeking confrontation, but clarity and recognition of its prior use in India, adding that litigation was a fallback if clean coexistence could not be achieved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As of now, I am exercising my legal right as it’s causing huge confusion to my customers,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, the world’s most populous nation and one of the fastest-growing internet markets, has become a key battleground for AI companies like Anthropic and its rival OpenAI. The country is also set to host an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit in New Delhi</a> next week, where Anthropic co-founder and chief executive Dario Amodei is appearing alongside other industry leaders like Sam Altman, Jensen Huang, and Sundar Pichai.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A court order dated January 20 and seen by TechCrunch shows that the court has issued notice and suit summons to Anthropic.

Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-users-are-about-to-get-hit-with-targeted-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">which the company announced last month</a>, drew ridicule in a series of Super Bowl ads that ran on Sunday from a top rival, Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its TV commercials, Anthropic poked fun at the idea that some AI companies, like OpenAI, would soon include advertising by showing how poorly integrated ads could disrupt the consumer experience. This was portrayed on-screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI CEO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/sam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sam Altman got extremely testy</a> about the jabs, <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2019139174339928189%7Ctwgr%5Ef7936706cec58630b15e0db69484ae55fcea10e0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fsam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">calling</a> the ads “dishonest” and Anthropic an “authoritarian company.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Consumers have so far resisted the idea of ads in AI responses. OpenAI faced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/openai-slammed-for-app-suggestions-that-looked-like-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">backlash late last year</a> when it tested app suggestions that looked like unwanted ads. Still, the AI company needs to generate revenue from its popular chatbot to cover the costs of developing its technology and growing the business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While understandable, critics fear that ads could influence ChatGPT’s answers. OpenAI denies this in its announcement, saying that ads will be optimized based on “what’s most helpful to you.” The company says ads will also always be clearly labeled as sponsored and separated from the organic content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In tests, OpenAI has tried matching ads to users based on the subject of their conversations, past chats, and previous ad interactions. For instance, users researching recipes might see ads for grocery delivery services or meal kits, the company says. OpenAI said advertisers won’t have access to user data, only aggregate information about ad performance, like views and clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users will also be able to view their history of interactions with ads and clear it at any time. Plus, OpenAI said users can dismiss ads, share feedback, view why they were shown an ad, and manage ad personalization settings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ads won’t be shown to users under 18, nor will they be placed near sensitive or regulated topics like health, politics, or mental health. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just last month, MicroVision bought the lidar assets of the buzzy-but-now-bankrupt Luminar <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/luminar-sale-approved-despite-last-minute-mystery-bid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">for $33 million</a>. Ouster itself has played the M&amp;A game a fair amount, too. In 2022, the company merged with rival player Velodyne. The year before that, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/ouster-and-velodyne-agree-to-merger-signaling-consolidation-in-lidar-industry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bought lidar startup Sense Photonics</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This consolidation is happening right as companies and investors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/techcrunch-mobility-physical-ai-enters-the-hype-machine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rush to build businesses</a> around “physical AI” — a broad term that encompasses everything from humanoid robotics and drones to self-driving cars and automated systems in warehouses. Even more obscure suppliers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/ethernovia-raises-90m-as-investors-rush-to-fund-physical-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raising big funding rounds</a> as these technologies develop. Some startups are even trying to spin up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/teradar-exits-stealth-with-an-all-weather-sensor-for-autonomy-and-150m-in-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">entirely new sensor modalities</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ouster co-founder and CEO Angus Pacala told TechCrunch in an interview that he had been eyeing StereoLabs for years. He said he sees lidar as “the core component of safety-critical, capable systems,” but that he wanted to “move up the stack.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “obvious additional sensors” to start working with in addition to lidar, Pacala said, are cameras. Pacala said 15-year-old StereoLabs is “best in class” on the hardware side, but he was especially drawn to how the company has been getting the most out of those cameras by being “incredibly savvy in adopting the cutting edge of AI models and edge compute.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In particular, Pacala highlighted StereoLabs’ development of a foundational AI model that can determine depth of objects from stereo cameras. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was a no-brainer for us to go out and approach them and basically pitch this vision of working with us to become a unified sensing and perception platform — a tier one [supplier] for these advanced physical AI systems,” Pacala said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the focus on integration, Ouster said StereoLabs will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while the hype has been feverish, Pacala said he didn’t buy StereoLabs simply because of the attention and money being thrown at physical AI. In fact, he committed maybe the gravest sin one can during a hype cycle: he poured some cold water on the buzz, especially around humanoid robotics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The business model here is not to just sell the fervor, it’s to actually make working systems that are certified, that are safe, that are really solving customer problems,” he said. “There’s going to be a little bit of disillusionment in physical AI as it turns out that it’s much longer time to market for all these humanoids.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pacala isn’t the only one trying to take a realistic view. In a recent interview with TechCrunch, MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said the sensor industry is “ripe for consolidation” because he believes there isn’t enough revenue to support all the current competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re going to get consolidation, or you’re going to get kind of a weeding out of the industry as people fall to the wayside,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is reportedly in talks to raise another $200 million at an $11 billion valuation led by Sequoia and Singapore’s GIC, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2026/02/09/legal-ai-startup-harvey-in-talks-to-raise-200-million-at-11-billion-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sources told Forbes.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the deal closes, Harvey’s valuation would jump by $3 billion in a matter of months. In December the company confirmed it had raised $160 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/legal-ai-startup-harvey-confirms-8b-valuation/\">at an $8 billion valuation</a> led by Andreessen Horowitz <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2025/10/29/legal-ai-startup-harvey-raises-150-million-at-8-billion-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last fall</a>. (Harvey declined to comment on its potential new raise.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Back in June, it announced a $300 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins and Coatue. A few months before that, in February 2025, it gobbled up a Sequoia-led <a href=\"https://www.harvey.ai/blog/harvey-raises-series-d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$300 million Series D</a> at a $3 billion valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, which offers an LLM AI for law firms, hit an annual recurring revenue rate of $190 million by the end of 2025, founder CEO Winston Weinberg shared <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/winston-weinberg_2025-was-a-big-year-for-harvey-a-few-highlights-activity-7415020362184187905-Cnia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on LinkedIn</a>. That was up from a $100 million ARR in August (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/a16z-vc-wants-founders-to-stop-stressing-over-insane-arr-numbers/\">depending on what the company means by ARR</a>), so that’s nearly double the contracted revenue in less than six months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How has it become one of the breakout winners of AI enterprise applications? Weinberg recently told TechCrunch’s editor-in-chief Connie Loizos <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/inside-harvey-how-a-first-year-legal-associate-built-one-of-silicon-valleys-hottest-startups/\">an incredible story of how the company originally</a> claimed the hearts of Silicon Valley’s powerhouse VCs. <br></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Workday co-founder and former CEO Aneel Bhusri will return as CEO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eschenbach joined Workday in December 2022 as co-CEO alongside Bhusri and had been operating as the company’s sole CEO since February 2024. Bhusri, who had led the company since 2009 — sometimes as co-CEO, sometimes as sole CEO — has been serving as the company’s executive chairman since 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Workday confirmed to TechCrunch that Bhusri is returning to the role permanently, as opposed to taking the helm during a search for a replacement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Workday says it made this leadership change to focus on its next chapter, which, unsurprisingly, is AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re now entering one of the most pivotal moments in our history,” Bhusri said in the company’s press release Monday. “AI is a bigger transformation than SaaS — and it will define the next generation of market leaders. I’m energized to return as CEO, working alongside our presidents Gerrit Kazmaier and Rob Enslin, and I’m excited about the opportunity in front of us.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last February, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/workday-cuts-nearly-2000-employees/\">Workday laid off 8.5% of its headcount</a>, or 1,750 people, with Eschenbach stating at the time that the company needed a new approach to labor in the age of AI.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"
