Companies started pushing out new versions of their software more frequently — and producing significantly more data because of it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Observe is responding to the latest big shift in technology: AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">San Mateo-based Observe helps companies get an inside look at the status of their software, which makes it easier for engineers to spot and solve disruptions and outages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recent advancements in AI are both a blessing and a burden for the company. Observe’s observability product incorporates AI agents to help make finding and fixing issues faster for its customers. But advancements in AI mean companies are shipping software even faster than before and seeing their data balloon because of it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO Jeremy Burton told TechCrunch that with the continual advancement of AI agents, observability continues to get more complex.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In a few years, you’re going to have hundreds or thousands of agents on your network that are all interacting with employees or interacting with each other,” Burton said. “That’s all great until something goes wrong, and you’ve got to try and, you know, do a Sherlock Holmes and figure out who done it, you know?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Observe is adapting to how the industry is changing, Burton said. The company released a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server earlier this year that allows developers to access their observability data from AI coding tools and LLMs. This is to help meet developers where they are already working, Burton said, and help them accomplish tasks easier.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have customers already that are using the MCP server and really trying fairly radical workflows,” Burton said. “They’re sitting in their development environment, and they say, ‘Hey, take a look at this ticket. Use Observe to go figure out what’s happening, and then describe to me the code that you think is problematic, and then suggest the effects.’ That would have been in the realm of science fiction even a year ago.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also working toward supporting Apache Iceberg, an open source data table format that allows businesses to own and standardize their own data. Burton said companies really like that approach, and Observe expects to be able to support that format by the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s revenue nearly tripled in 2024, and it saw 93% gross retention of its customers, although Burton declined to share specific numbers. The company counts large enterprises, including CapitalOne, Paramount, and Dialpad, as customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Observe raised $156 million in a Series C round led by Sutter Hill Ventures with participation from Madrona Ventures, Alumni Ventures, and strategic investors like Snowflake, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company will put the capital toward research and development and hiring. Observe hopes to roll out its private preview for Apache Iceberg support shortly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve got a couple of really good things out there, but I feel like we’ve just gotten started,” Burton said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Companies likely to be affected by these rules include major names such as Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI, as well as several other large generative models, and they will have two years to comply fully with the AI Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/eu-ai-code-practice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> on Wednesday, Kent Walker, president of global affairs at Google, conceded that the final version of the code of practice was better than what the EU proposed initially, but he still noted reservations around the AI Act and the code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing Europe’s development and deployment of AI. In particular, departures from EU copyright law, steps that slow approvals, or requirements that expose trade secrets could chill European model development and deployment, harming Europe’s competitiveness,” wrote Walker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By signing the EU’s <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">code of practice</a>, AI companies would agree to follow a slate of guidelines, which include providing updated documentation about their AI tools and services; no training AI on pirated content; and complying with requests from content owners to not use their works in their datasets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/eu-council-gives-final-nod-to-set-up-risk-based-regulations-for-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">risk-based regulation</a> for AI applications, the EU’s landmark AI Act bans some “unacceptable risk” use cases, such as cognitive behavioral manipulation or social scoring. The rules also define a set of “high-risk” uses, including biometrics and facial recognition, and the use of AI in domains like education and employment. The act also requires developers to register AI systems and meet risk- and quality-management obligations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The technology will initially roll out to U.S. users as a pilot program, allowing contributors to both write and rate Footnotes on TikTok videos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All U.S. TikTok users are able to view the notes that have been rated as helpful and submit their own ratings in return.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/tiktok-begins-testing-footnotes-a-new-community-notes-like-feature/\">announced its plans to test Footnotes</a> in April. At the time, it described the feature as a way to give the community more context around TikTok’s content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like X’s Community Notes and other, similar programs, TikTok uses a bridging algorithm that tries to find consensus among people who typically have different views. If both sides rate a note as helpful, then it’s more likely to be true, according to this method. This also guards against brigading, where one side tries to sway a decision their way by voting similarly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says notes can help people better understand what they’re seeing on the platform by adding more information and context. Sometimes the person who posted the video that gets a note is actively trying to misrepresent a situation, while other times they may have simply missed other information or updates that could be helpful for viewers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3032119\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg 5832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=300,94 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=768,240 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=680,212 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=1200,374 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=1280,399 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=430,134 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=720,225 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=900,281 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=800,250 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=1536,479 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=2048,639 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=668,208 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=1440,449 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=708,221 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=50,16 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 5832px) 100vw, 5832px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TikTok</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok began allowing U.S. users to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/falcon/communitysafety/page/footnotes/index.html?container_color_auto_dark=1&amp;hide_nav_bar=1&amp;should_full_screen=1&amp;use_spark=1&amp;enter_from=blog_post_link\">apply</a> to be a contributor back in April, as long as they were at least 18, had been on TikTok for more than six months, and had no recent history of violating TikTok’s Community Standards.

Plus, users who previously commented the phrase or who comment the phrase in the future will be muted for the creator’s chosen duration.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3032156\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54686604762_7888b7e340_b.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TikTok</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To help creators better manage messages, TikTok is launching a new professional inbox experience called the “Creator Inbox,” which includes “Unread” and “Starred” folders.

The Space Force has already awarded contracts to defense primes Boeing and Northrop Grumman to develop prototype payloads for satellites heading to far-away geostationary orbit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the program is entering a new phase. On Tuesday, the Space Force awarded five additional contracts for the design and demonstration of purpose-built satellites to provide jam-resistant comms to tactical forces. The winners include previous winners Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Viasat, and Intelsat, plus a relative newcomer: Astranis, a venture-backed startup based in San Francisco. (Intelsat will buy its satellite bus from K2 Space, another venture-backed startup.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The initial awards are relatively small, totaling $37.3 million combined. But the program has a $4 billion award ceiling, so the winners could sign on to a much more lucrative defense deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each firm will develop its architectures through January 2026. After that, the Space Force will select one design and award an additional contract for the first satellite, with a launch planned in 2028. Additional production awards will be doled out, also in 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The PTS-G contracts are a notable departure from how the military has historically procured geostationary satellites, which have typically had extremely long timelines from contract award to launch, and would cost hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars per spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In contrast, the Space Force is clearly trying to leverage the speed of commercial entrants and encourage competition by selecting multiple vendors for the initial phase of the program.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our PTS-G contract transforms how SSC acquires SATCOM capability for the warfighter,” program executive officer Cordell DeLaPena Jr. said in a news release. “The incorporation of commercial baseline designs to meet military capability significantly enhances the Space Force’s speed and efficiency to add capability to meet emerging threats.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But one U.S. senator wants to know if other tech giants, like Google, have also received secret backdoor demands from the U.K. government. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google refused to answer the lawmaker’s questions but has since told TechCrunch that the technology giant has not received a backdoor demand, marking the first time that Google has confirmed it is not subject to a similar U.K. order.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, The Washington Post reported that the U.K. Home Office <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sought a secret court order in the U.K.’s surveillance court</a> demanding that Apple allow U.K. authorities to access the end-to-end encrypted cloud data stored on any customer in the world, including their iPhone and iPad backups. Apple encrypts the data in such a way that only customers, and not Apple, can access their data stored on its servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under U.K. law, tech companies subject to secret surveillance court orders, such as Apple, are legally barred from revealing details of an order, or the existence of the order itself, despite <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">details of the demand publicly leaking earlier this year</a>. Critics called the secret order against Apple “draconian,” saying it would have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/uks-secret-apple-icloud-backdoor-order-is-a-global-emergency-say-critics/\">global ramifications for users’ privacy</a>. Apple has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/apple-is-challenging-u-k-s-icloud-encryption-backdoor-order/\">since appealed the legality of the order</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26035106-wyden-dni-google-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a new letter</a> sent to top U.S. intelligence official Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday, Sen. Ron Wyden, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that while tech companies cannot say whether they have received a U.K. order, at least one technology giant has confirmed that it hasn’t received one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta, which uses end-to-end encryption to protect user messages sent between WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, told Wyden’s office on March 17 that the company has “not received an order to backdoor our encrypted services, like that reported about Apple.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, for its part, would not tell Wyden’s office if it had received a U.K. government order for accessing encrypted data, such as Android backups, “only stating that if it had received a technical capabilities notice, it would be prohibited from disclosing that fact,” said Wyden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google spokesperson Karl Ryan told TechCrunch in a statement: “We have never built any mechanism or ‘backdoor’ to circumvent end-to-end encryption in our products. If we say a product is end-to-end encrypted, it is.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When explicitly asked by TechCrunch, Ryan said: “We haven’t received a technical capabilities notice,” referring to any U.K. surveillance order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wyden’s letter, first reported by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/29/uk-encryption-backdoor-wyden-letter-gabbard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26035106-wyden-dni-google-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared with TechCrunch</a>, called on Gabbard to make public its “assessment of the national security risks posed by the U.K.’s surveillance laws and its reported secret demands of U.S. companies.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated with additional comment from Google, shared in response to a TechCrunch inquiry.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The potential power source works by compressing fuel until it turns into a dense plasma, so dense that atoms begin fusing, releasing energy in the process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s so much here. The best ideas have yet to come to unlock a lot of potential in the fusion space,” Duncan Turner, general partner at SOSV, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But fusion is just the tip of the iceberg, Turner said. The company has already invested in two companies, including YPlasma, which uses plasma actuators to cool data center chips and control airflow over wind turbine blades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finding new uses for plasma in semiconductor manufacturing, where the state of matter already plays a role, could unlock new materials and processes, Turner said. Spacecraft could benefit from plasma thrusters, which are more fuel efficient than traditional thrusters.

The company expects to introduce Study Mode to its Edu subscribers, which largely consists of young people whose school administrator’s have purchased a plan for the entire student body, in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Study Mode is OpenAI’s attempt to address <a href=\"https://campustechnology.com/articles/2024/08/28/survey-86-of-students-already-use-ai-in-their-studies.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the millions of students who use ChatGPT in school</a>. Studies have shown that using <a href=\"https://nssa.stanford.edu/news/study-ai-assisted-tutoring-boosts-students-math-skills#:~:text=In%20all%2C%20about%201%2C000%20students,didn't%20work%20with%20AI.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT can be a helpful tutor </a>for young people, but it also <a href=\"https://www.psypost.org/study-finds-chatgpt-eases-students-cognitive-load-but-at-the-expense-of-critical-thinking/#google_vignette\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">may harm their critical thinking skills.</a> A research paper released in June found that <a href=\"https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">people who use ChatGPT to write essays exhibit lower brain activity during the process</a> compared to those who use Google Search or nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When ChatGPT first launched in 2022, its widespread use in school settings sparked fear among educators, leading to generative AI bans in many American school districts. By 2023, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/business/schools-chatgpt-chatbot-bans.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some of those schools repealed their ChatGPT bans</a>, and teachers around the country came to terms with the fact that ChatGPT would be a part of young people’s lives from now on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now with the launch of Study Mode, OpenAI hopes to improve ChatGPT as a learning tool, and not just an answer engine. Anthropic launched a similar tool for its AI chatbot Claude, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/anthropic-launches-an-ai-chatbot-tier-for-colleges-and-universities/\">called Learning Mode</a>, in April.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, there are limitations to how effective Study Mode truly is. Students can easily switch into the regular mode of ChatGPT if they just want an answer to a question. OpenAI’s VP of Education, Leah Belsky, told TechCrunch in a briefing that the company is not offering tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. However, Belsky said OpenAI may explore administrative or parental controls in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means it will take a committed student to use Study Mode — the kids have to really want to learn, not just finish their assignment.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says Study Mode is the company’s first step to improving learning in ChatGPT and aims to publish more information in the future about how students use generative AI throughout their education.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, Spotify is teasing that generative AI advances may pave the way for an even more conversational interface with the streaming service in the future, according to comments made during Spotify’s second-quarter earnings call with investors on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked about how AI was affecting its business, Spotify Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström noted that consumers today are able to talk to Spotify in plain English to request music, allowing the company to associate which phrases connect with which songs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can think of it as us getting a new dataset,” he said. “Spotify’s got this unique dataset from all of its playlists, which was really song-to-song — like which song goes well with another song, kind of the Amazon ‘people who bought this also bought that,’” he said. Meanwhile, the voice interface is delivering new insights to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And that’s completely new to us, and it’s a very, very valuable dataset that we are collecting very quickly,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, the exec says we can expect Spotify’s consumer experiences to get “much more interactive.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can already write to Spotify, talk to Spotify. You’re just going to see that expand,” Söderström said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, AI technology would allow Spotify to do more than just predict what someone might want to listen to, whether music, podcasts, or audiobooks, as it does today. Instead of only making predictions, it would be able to “reason” over the user’s listening history and what they said to the AI DJ. The reference to reasoning suggests that Spotify is looking toward AI reasoning models that can perform more complex tasks across multiple steps.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The voice data in question comes from Spotify’s AI DJ feature. In May 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/spotifys-ai-dj-now-lets-you-use-voice-commands-to-personalize-your-tunes/\">Spotify introduced a way</a> for Premium subscribers to make voice requests to the English-language AI DJ by pressing a button in the app. This lets users change the music, the genre, or the mood of a playlist using a voice command.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Consumer features aren’t the only way Spotify is leveraging AI. During the call, the exec also mentioned that Spotify is using generative AI internally to more rapidly prototype products and create efficiencies in other areas of its business, like finance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the quarter, Spotify <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/spotify-q2-2025-earnings-subscribers-profit-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hit 276 million paying subscribers</a>, up 12% year-over-year, and 696 million monthly active users, but swung to a loss after missing revenue targets.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube on Tuesday announced it’s beginning to roll out age-estimation technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in order to provide a more age-appropriate experience. The company says it will use a variety of signals to determine the users’ possible age, regardless of what the user entered as their birthday when they signed up for an account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When YouTube identifies a user as a teen, it <span>intr</span>oduces new protections and experiences, which include disabling personalized advertising, safeguards that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/youtubes-new-teen-safeguards-limit-repeated-viewing-of-some-video-topics-and-more/\">limit repetitive viewing</a> of certain types of content, and enabling <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/48055830/bedtime-reminders-other-features-to-help-you-manage-screen-time?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">digital well-being tools</a> such as screen time and bedtime reminders, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These protections already exist on YouTube, but have only been applied to those who verified themselves as teens, not those who may have withheld their real age. For instance, in 2023, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/youtubes-new-teen-safeguards-limit-repeated-viewing-of-some-video-topics-and-more/\">YouTube began limiting repeated viewing of videos</a> that could trigger body image issues or those that display social aggression. The company has also been developing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/youtube-rolls-out-new-tools-to-help-you-stop-watching/\">digital well-being tools since 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the new system incorrectly identifies a user as under 18 when they are not, YouTube says the user will be given the option to verify their age with a credit card, government ID, or selfie. Only users who have been directly verified through this method or whose age has been inferred to be over 18 will be able to view the age-restricted content on the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The machine learning-powered technology will begin to roll out over the next few weeks to a small set of U.S. users and will then be monitored before rolling out more widely, the company says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plans to introduce age inference technology were <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-big-bets-for-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced in February</a> as part of YouTube’s 2025 roadmap. The plans are also the latest step in attempting to make YouTube safer for younger users, following the <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-kids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2015 launch of the YouTube Kids app</a> and the <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/a-collaborative-approach-to-teen-supervision-on-youtube/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2024 rollout of supervised accounts</a>. The features also arrive as social media more broadly is coming under increased government scrutiny in the United States, where platform makers, including Apple and Google, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-25/meta-clashes-with-apple-google-over-child-age-check-legislation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have pitted their lobbyists against those from big tech companies</a> like Meta over who’s responsible for age verification and children’s safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, a handful of U.S. states have taken matters into their own hands, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_age_verification_laws_in_the_United_States\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over a dozen</a> states have passed or proposed laws to regulate minors’ use of social media. Many of these require age verification or parental consent, including those in Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Utah, Texas, Maryland, Tennessee, and Connecticut, among others. (However, some laws, like those in Utah and Arkansas, are blocked by litigation at this time and are not enforceable, while others are still pending implementation.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.K. also began enforcing its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/u-k-starts-enforcing-online-age-check-rules/\">own age-verification checks</a> this week following the 2023 passing of the Online Safety Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube isn’t sharing specifics about the signals it’s using to infer a user’s age, but notes that it will look at some data like the YouTube activity and the longevity of a user’s account to make a determination if the user is under 18. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new system will apply only to signed-in users, as signed-out users already cannot access age-restricted content, and will be available across platforms, including web, mobile, and connected TV.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The announcement said that the solutions the company is implementing will gradually restore services by Wednesday, and that “there is no evidence to suggest that any internal or customer data has been exfiltrated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Orange did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment, which included questions about the nature of the cyberattack, and whether the company has the technical means to detect any data exfiltration. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said in the announcement that it is engaging and informing affected customers, and filed a complaint with “relevant authorities,” without providing specifics. Companies in Europe that are subject to GDPR, the bloc’s data protection rules, are required to notify their local data protection authorities within three days of a suspected data breach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Orange serves 291 million customers worldwide, across 26 different countries, and has 127,000 employees, <a href=\"http://orange.com/en/group/overview/orange-group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the company</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Boring Company, Elon Musk’s tunnel-digging company, and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee have <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/governor/news/2025/7/28/gov--lee--the-boring-company-unveil-transformative-underground-music-city-loop-project.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> a plan to build a 10-mile “loop” that will connect Nashville’s downtown and its convention center to the area’s airport. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The project will be privately funded by The Boring Company “and its private partners,” according to the Governor’s press release, though those partners are not named. The Boring Company and local officials will now begin a “public process to evaluate potential routes, engage community stakeholders, and finalize plans for the project’s initial 10-mile phase.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Construction won’t begin until the project clears the approvals process. But the governor’s office said the first segment of the loop could be operational as “early as fall of 2026.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that happens, Nashville would become the second city where The Boring Company has opened such a system, with the first being Las Vegas. The company has spent the last few years in Sin City digging and opening tunnels around the Las Vegas Convention Center, and claims to have given 3 million rides in Teslas to date.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk launched The Boring Company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/elon-musk-doesnt-just-want-to-bore-tunnels-he-wants-to-make-boring-better/\">in early 2017</a> (after publicly noodling about the idea on Twitter while stuck in traffic in late 2016), and it has taken many forms since then. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The original video detailing Musk’s idea — now set to private on YouTube — showed vehicles getting removed from surface street gridlock by an elevator-meets-sled system and lowered into a three-dimensional underground network of tunnels. Musk also claimed during the first Trump administration that The Boring Company had received “verbal govt approval” to dig tunnels from New York City to Washington, D.C. that, leveraging hyperloop technology, could make the trip in just 29 minutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of that ever happened. The Boring Company abandoned plans to dig a major tunnel system underneath <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16737488/boring-company-los-angeles-map-tunnels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the greater Los Angeles area</a> after pushback from locals. A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236075/elon-musk-chicago-boring-company-tunnel-politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">similar thing happened in Chicago</a>. And the Boring Company has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-boring-company-tunnel-traffic-11669658396?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhfvMIXMbeiC55gLg73wrgyCcOXRL3f0FVR-EWU-4pIfdr3q13zGHUhfzekY18%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6888d934&amp;gaa_sig=IRGHAhqL20ytOkZQLuePilNsoc3Mmmp0_wCVJQnQCrjXXoJX3YrzYPV_ecIYHGxqogF5Tbp9UkA7h5anONPIWw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">essentially ghosted many other cities around the country</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea of the hyperloop, which Musk admitted to biographer Ashlee Vance came from his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/22/hyperloop-one-elon-musk-high-speed-rail/\">hatred of California’s high-speed rail system</a>, was also cast aside. Even the Teslas that traverse the Las Vegas tunnels are being driven by humans, despite Musk’s obsession with self-driving cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, The Boring Company now more closely resembles a glorified convention center people-mover, although there are some potential benefits to its approach versus the typical monorail setup. Construction should be less disruptive to Nashville’s daily traffic. And, in its current form at least, it’s not costing taxpayers money.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Tennessee governor’s office cites The Boring Company’s safety record in Las Vegas in the announcement — the loop “recently earned a 99.57% safety and security rating” from the Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration, according to the press release — it is careful not to mention the trouble that Musk’s tunnel-digging effort has experienced during construction. (The governor’s office could not be reached for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/spacex-worker-injury-rates-at-starbase-outpace-industry-rivals/\">other Musk companies</a>, the pace at which The Boring Company operates — the same speed that the Tennessee governor’s office praised in its announcement — has been a concern for some of its workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Fortune’s Jessica Mathews <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that a Boring Company employee told his then-safety manager: “I have watched my friends get injured due to the fast pace we’ve been running… I refuse to be the first fatality in this company’s history. No tunnel is worth a single person’s life.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That same safety manager even spoke to Fortune on the record, saying: “The conditions they were told to work in were honestly almost unbearable … I couldn’t fix any of the things that were wrong.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Dorsey says he coded the basis of the app over the course of a weekend in early July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bitchat operates through Bluetooth mesh networks, which means that users can send messages to others within the range of Bluetooth connectivity — usually around 100 meters — without cell reception or a Wi-Fi connection. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app’s UX is very minimal. There is no log-in system, and you’re immediately brought to an instant messaging box, where you can see what nearby users are saying (if anyone is actually around you and using the app) and set your display name, which can be changed at any time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bitchat is sparking interest due to Dorsey’s reputation, the concept of Bluetooth-powered messaging apps is not new. These apps are also popular in settings like large music festivals, where cell service may be limited, or in the aftermath of natural disasters, where cell service and Wi-Fi availability may be impacted. The Bluetooth messaging app <a href=\"https://bridgefy.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bridgefy</a> was notably used during pro-democracy <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49565587\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">protests</a> in Hong Kong, since its ability to function without the internet made it harder for authorities to detect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey advertised Bitchat as a secure, private messaging platform when it went live for beta use earlier this month. But security researcher Alex Radocea <a href=\"https://www.supernetworks.org/pages/blog/agentic-insecurity-vibes-on-bitchat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pointed out in a blog post</a> that it’s easy to impersonate other people within Bitchat, calling into question how secure the “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/vibe-coding/\">vibe-coded</a>” app really is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In cryptography, details matter,” Radocea wrote. “A protocol that has the right vibes can have fundamental substance flaws that compromise everything it claims to protect.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey later admitted that the software had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/jack-dorsey-says-his-secure-new-bitchat-app-has-not-been-tested-for-security/\">not been subject to an external security review</a> and thus may contain vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bitchat’s concerns around impersonation also extend to the app itself. As of now, the app can be downloaded for iOS via the App Store, or it can be loaded onto an Android device by <a href=\"https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat-android/releases/tag/0.8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">downloading the app from GitHub</a>. However, the Google Play store hosts multiple apps that appear to be pretending to be Dorsey’s app, which have garnered thousands of downloads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey has not directly addressed the fake Bitchat apps on the Google Play store, but he did repost <a href=\"https://x.com/callebtc/status/1949950406995374379\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">another user’s X post</a> that said that Bitchat is not yet on Google Play, and to “beware of fakes.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
