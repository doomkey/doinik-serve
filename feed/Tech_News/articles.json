Plasmas inside the company’s Polaris prototype reactor have reached 150 million degrees Celsius, three-quarters of the way toward what the company thinks it will need to operate a commercial fusion power plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re obviously really excited to be able to get to this place,” David Kirtley, Helion’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Polaris is also operating using deuterium-tritium fuel — a mixture of two hydrogen isotopes — which Kirtley said makes Helion the first fusion company to do so. “We were able to see the fusion power output increase dramatically as expected in the form of heat,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is locked in a race with several other companies that are seeking to commercialize fusion power, potentially unlimited source of clean energy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That potential has investors rushing to bet on the technology. This week, Inertia Enterprises announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/twilio-co-founders-fusion-power-startup-raises-450m-from-bessemer-and-alphabets-gv/\">$450 million Series A</a> round that included Bessemer and GV. In January, Type One Energy told TechCrunch it was in the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/bill-gates-backed-type-one-energy-raises-87m-ahead-of-250m-series-b/\">midst of raising $250 million</a>, while last summer Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">$863 million</a> from investors including Google and Nvidia. Helion itself raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/helion-raises-425m-to-help-build-a-fusion-reactor-for-microsoft/\">$425 million</a> last year from a group that included Sam Altman, Mithril, Lightspeed, and SoftBank.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While most other fusion startups are targeting the early 2030s to put electricity on the grid, Helion has a contract with Microsoft to sell it electricity starting in 2028, though that power would come from a larger commercial reactor called Orion that the company is currently building, not Polaris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every fusion startup has its own milestones based on the design of its reactor. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, needs to heat its plasmas to more than 100 million degrees C inside of its tokamak, a doughnut-shaped device that uses powerful magnets to contain the plasma.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helion’s reactor is different, needing plasmas that are about twice as hot to function as intended. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s reactor design is what’s called a field-reversed configuration. The inside chamber looks like an hourglass, and at the wide ends, fuel gets injected and turned into plasmas. Magnets then accelerate the plasmas toward each other. When they first merge, they’re around 10 million to 20 million degrees C. Powerful magnets then compress the merged ball further, raising the temperature to 150 million degrees C. It all happens in less than a millisecond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of extracting energy from the fusion reactions in the form of heat, Helion uses the fusion reaction’s own magnetic field to generate electricity. Each pulse will push back against the reactor’s own magnets, inducing electrical current that can be harvested. By harvesting electricity directly from the fusion reactions, the company hopes to be more efficient than its competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last year, Kirtley said that Helion had refined some of the circuits in the reactor to boost how much electricity they recover.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the company uses deuterium-tritium fuel today, down the road it plans to use deuterium-helium-3. Most fusion companies plan to use deuterium-tritium and extract energy as heat. Helion’s fuel choice, deuterium-helium-3, produces more charged particles, which push forcefully against the magnetic fields that confine the plasma, making it better suited for Helion’s approach of generating electricity directly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helion’s ultimate goal is to produce plasmas that hit 200 million degrees C, far higher than other companies’ targets, a function of its reactor design and fuel choice. “We believe that at 200 million degrees, that’s where you get into that optimal sweet spot of where you want to operate a power plant,” Kirtley said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked whether Helion had reached scientific breakeven — the point where a fusion reaction generates more energy than it requires to start it — Kirtley demurred. “We focus on the electricity piece, making electricity, rather than the pure scientific milestones.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helium-3 is common on the Moon, but not here on Earth, so Helion must make its own fuel. To start, it’ll fuse deuterium nuclei to produce the first batches. In regular operation, while the main source of power will be deuterium-helium-3 fusion, some of the reactions will still be deuterium-on-deuterium, which will produce helium-3 that the company will purify and reuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Work is already underway to refine the fuel cycle. “It’s been a pleasant surprise in that a lot of that technology has been easier to do than maybe we expected,” Kirtley said. Helion has been able to produce helium-3 “at very high efficiencies in terms of both throughput and purity,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Helion is currently the only fusion startup using helium-3 in its fuel, Kirtley said he thinks other companies will in the future, hinting that he’d be open to selling it to them. “Other folks — as they come along and recognize that they want to do this approach of direct electricity recovery and see the efficiency gains from it — will want to be using helium-3 fuel as well,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside its experiments with Polaris, Helion is also building Orion, a 50-megawatt fusion reactor it needs to fulfill its Microsoft contract “Our ultimate goal is not to build and deliver Polaris,” Kirtley said. “That’s a step along the way towards scaled power plants.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Alas, this driverless future comes with its own set of problems. These vehicles can be rendered inert if a passenger accidentally leaves the door open.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorDash_Dasher/comments/1r170zc/craziest_offer/?share_id=-Q9fJkDiV5VLbNB2mHnnT&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1\">a Reddit post</a>, one DoorDash driver discovered this issue when an odd request appeared in their queue. Instead of making a delivery, the driver was offered $6.25 to drive less than one mile to a Waymo vehicle and close its door. After “verified completion,” they would get an extra $5.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You actually ‘door’ dashed,” one commenter noted.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?w=314\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3092771\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=555,1200 555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=592,1280 592w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=199,430 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=333,720 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=416,900 416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=370,800 370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=309,668 309w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=285,617 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=245,531 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/craziest-offer-v0-83q95pe2cpig1.webp?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorDash_Dasher/comments/1r170zc/craziest_offer/?share_id=-Q9fJkDiV5VLbNB2mHnnT&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems too ironic to be real. Waymo vehicles represent technological breakthroughs that once seemed unfathomable. The Alphabet-owned company just raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/waymo-raises-16-billion-round-to-scale-robotaxi-fleet-london-tokyo/\">$16 billion</a> to take its driverless cars international!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Waymo and DoorDash confirmed to TechCrunch that this Reddit post is legitimate. This is, in fact, a real problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” Waymo and DoorDash said in a joint response. (The door-closing partnership, which began <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.404media.co/waymo-is-getting-doordashers-to-close-doors-on-self-driving-cars/\">earlier this year</a>, is just one facet of Waymo and DoorDash’s broader relationship. In October, the companies launched an autonomous delivery service in Phoenix, where Waymo vehicles deliver food and groceries to DoorDash customers.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If a Waymo door is left open, it’s worth it to the company to pay someone to close it — the car cannot complete any more rides if it’s left immobile. Not to mention, an unmoving car could block the flow of traffic. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t the first time Waymo has enlisted help with its door troubles. In Los Angeles, Waymo works with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/honk-the-uber-for-towing-services-raises-18-million/\">Honk</a>, an app that’s like Uber for towing services. According to reports, Honk users in L.A. have been offered <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/25/waymo-robots-human-work/\">up to $24</a> to close a Waymo door — more than double what Atlanta DoorDash drivers receive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company noted that Waymo’s future vehicles will have automated door closures.

According to third-party data, ChatGPT sees 75 billion searches per month, while Pinterest sees 80 billion searches and generates 1.7 billion monthly clicks, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That makes us one of the largest search destinations in the world. And importantly, more than half of those searches are commercial in nature, compared to, I think . . . approximately 2% [of ChatGPT searches],” Ready added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pinterest in the fourth quarter missed expectations on both revenue and earnings per share, reporting $1.32 billion in revenue versus $1.33 billion expected, and earnings per share of 67 cents, compared to the 69 cents projected. It also forecast that first-quarter 2026 sales will come in between $951 million to $971 million, below the $980 million expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company blamed its shortfall on larger advertisers pulling back on spend, particularly in Europe, and a new furniture tariff implemented in October that caused issues within the home category. It said those trends could worsen in the first quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Surprisingly, Pinterest missed on earnings despite a user base that’s growing faster than expected. The company reported monthly active users were up 12% year-over-year to 619 million, when Wall Street had forecast 613 million users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shares <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/pinterest-pins-q4-earnings-report-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped</a> 20% in after-hours trading.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pinterest has long struggled to translate the high usage of its platform into ad dollars, as its users often go to Pinterest to plan and dream, not shop and buy. That challenge could become even more acute in the AI era, especially if advertisers shift their dollars to platforms where intent to buy is clearer — such as chatbot requests that ask for product recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked about how Pinterest will navigate the shift toward AI-powered shopping, Ready pointed to the company’s visual search, discovery, and personalization features, which he said would point users to relevant products when they open the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re helping them complete those commercial journeys without having to type in a single prompt,” he said, also noting that Pinterest had benefited from an easier checkout flow that came from its partnership with Amazon. He said customers didn’t yet seem ready to allow an AI to make a purchase on their behalf, but said Pinterest would be ready if that time came.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’ll actually be one of the easiest parts of the commercial journey to solve,” he claimed. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In IBM’s case, it’s going all in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hardware giant IBM plans to triple entry-level hiring in the U.S. in 2026, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-12/ibm-plans-to-triple-entry-level-hiring-in-the-us-in-2026?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting from Bloomberg</a>. Nickle LaMoreaux, IBM’s chief human resource officer, announced the initiative at Charter’s Leading with AI Summit on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And yes, it’s for all these jobs that we’re being told AI can do,” LaMoreaux said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These jobs will look different than the entry-level jobs IBM used to offer, she explained. According to LaMoreaux, she went through and changed the descriptions for these entry-level jobs so they were less focused on areas AI can actually automate — like coding — and more focused on people-forward areas like engaging with customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This strategy makes sense. Even if an enterprise like IBM doesn’t necessarily need the same amount of entry-level talent that it did before, fostering less experienced workers helps ensure these employees have the skills needed for the higher-level roles down the road.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IBM didn’t specify how many people they would be hiring in this initiative. TechCrunch reached out to IBM for more information on the hiring plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year could be a pivotal one regarding what the impact of AI on the hiring market will look like. An MIT study in 2025 estimated that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/26/mit-study-finds-ai-can-already-replace-11point7percent-of-us-workforce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">11.7% of jobs could likely already be automated by AI</a>.

But in 2025, it was the company’s software and services that helped its annual revenue grow by 8%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian reported Thursday $5.38 billion in total revenue in 2025, up from $4.97 billion from the prior year. That rosy picture dulls a bit when looking just at its automotive revenue, which fell 15% to $3.8 billion in 2025. The fall was fueled by a $134 million drop in regulatory credit sales and lower vehicle deliveries, which were partially offset by higher average selling prices, according to Rivian. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, software and services revenue grew more than threefold to $1.55 billion for the year. And the joint venture with Volkswagen Group was behind most of that growth, according to Rivian. The “services” component of this line item, which Rivian doesn’t break out, includes a variety of items, including vehicle repair, vehicle trade-ins, and maintenance services. The remainder, and the bulk of the revenue, is from software, and specifically due to the joint venture with VW Group. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">VW and Rivian formed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/the-rivian-volkswagen-joint-venture-deal-is-now-up-to-5-8b/\">technology joint venture</a> in 2024 that is worth up to $5.8 billion. The joint venture is milestone-based and in 2025 Rivian hit the mark, which meant a $1 billion payout in the form of a share sale. Under the terms of the JV, Rivian will supply VW Group with its existing electrical architecture and software technology stack. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian received an initial $1 billion convertible note in 2024 and another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/rivian-receives-the-next-1b-from-volkswagen-as-sales-struggles-continue/\">$1 billion payment</a> in July 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian is expected to continue to receive payments from VW Group through 2027. Rivian is expected to receive an additional $2 billion of capital as part of the joint venture in 2026, CFO Claire McDonough said Thursday on the company earnings call. About $1 billion of that is subject to the successful completion of winter testing, which is underway. The remaining $1 billion is nonrecourse debt, which is expected to be received in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while the funds provide a hefty stopgap, Rivian’s financial success in 2026 will hinge largely on the rollout of its next EV, the R2. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian confirmed in its earnings report Thursday that the R2 SUV, which is designed to be cheaper to build and less expensive for customers, will come to market by June 2026. That “cheaper to build” line item is particularly crucial for Rivian, which has historically lost money on every vehicle it makes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian has spent years trying to push the cost of goods sold figure down. And it has made progress with the rollout of its second-generation flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV. For instance, McDonough said “in the fourth quarter it was able to deliver $92,000 of cogs per unit and that was about a $4,000 per unit improvement relative to the third quarter.” Rivian’s cogs per unit was $99,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company saw its total automotive cost of revenue decrease year-over-year from $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 to $898 million in the same quarter in 2025. Notably, the company’s cost of revenue for software steadily inched up throughout 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The R2 SUV, which will initially launch as a dual motor all-wheel-drive model, is an opportunity to further reduce costs. The company is expected to release more information about the R2, including final specs, on March 12. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian’s guidance for 2026 suggests that it is banking on demand for R2 and its ability to ramp up production. The company said Thursday it expects to deliver between 62,000 and 67,000 vehicles in 2026 — which could provide up to a 59% bump from last year. Rivian delivered 42,247 vehicles in 2025, which includes its two R1 consumer vehicles and the electric delivery van (EDV). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe noted that the company expects some growth in EDV sales in 2026. Rivian plans to produce an all-wheel-drive version and a larger battery pack variant of the EDV, for which Amazon is its primary customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Both of those are to help unlock specific use cases within the Amazon network,” Scaringe said. “We’re working really closely with Amazon in defining the requirements of those and excited to get those launched.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company isn’t signaling profitability — on an adjusted basis — just yet. But it is offering up considerable improvement on that front. Rivian reported a $3.6 billion net loss in 2025; it expects an adjusted net loss of between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for 2026. Rivian also projects capital expenditures will be between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion this year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And furthermore, Musk says the best way to achieve that is to build a city on the moon to manufacture space computers and hurl them into the solar system using a big maglev train.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that all feels a bit much, veteran Musk watchers know there’s a clue about where the discussion appears in a video of an <a href=\"https://x.com/xai/status/2021667200885829667\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">all-hands meeting</a> xAI shared with the public. The slide describing the moon base comes at the end of the presentation deck, where, during SpaceX pep talks, Musk typically shares renderings of SpaceX rockets landing on Mars and waxes rhapsodic about the future of multi-planetary humanity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the moon base comes just after SpaceX has publicly backed away from its long-held goal of colonizing Mars. Now, with xAI in the corporate fold, Musk needs a new science fiction metaphor for the future: In this case, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kardashev Scale</a>, a theoretical measure of galactic civilizations coined by the eponymous Soviet astronomer in the 1960s. The idea is climbing the scale of energy usage — early civilizations figure out how to leverage all the power sources on their planets, and then (hypothetically) go to space and build infrastructure to capture the energy of the sun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the moon base, Musk says the company could harness “maybe even a few percent of the sun’s energy” to train and operate AI models. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he told his staff, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the nine years since Musk unveiled his plan for Martian exploration and colonization, the vision has been an effective hiring tool for SpaceX: The founding tale of Musk’s interest in the Red Planet offered a long-term vision that united the company’s various development efforts, and signaled the company’s ambition among other space contractors that settled for incremental work on government priorities. “Occupy Mars” t-shirts offered a visible symbol of SpaceX’s aspirations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s where the hypothetical moon base fits in — part of a long history of Musk wrapping his companies in a powerful narrative.

Plans announced in 2016 to repurpose the company’s Dragon spacecraft as a Mars lander were abandoned the next year after the technical challenges became too costly. And since Musk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unveiled</a> the vehicle that would become Starship in 2016, its capabilities, initially intended for Mars colonization, have been scaled back to focus on two more remunerative tasks: launching satellites for the Starlink comms network and $4 billion worth of contracts to land astronauts on the moon for NASA.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike a multi-planetary civilization, there may be some logic in having SpaceX purchase a money-burning AI and social media to build data centers in Earth orbit, particularly if forecasts of rising demand and costs on the ground come true. Experts suggest that it might be possible in the 2030s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hypothetically, building satellites on the moon would require a lot more of Musk’s other dreams coming true first. Scientists and startups are experimenting with <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-push-to-make-semiconductors-in-space-just-took-a-serious-leap-forward/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">building chips</a> and other precision components in space. But mass-producing many tons of advanced computers on the moon means we’re living in a universe where it is dramatically cheaper to get to space, which is the central requirement for those technologies, getting all the raw materials for such an effort to the moon, plus whatever is required for a “self-sustaining city.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a sense, that’s the point: This is the, uh, stretch goal. If meme-happy retail investors buy the argument, they could turn SpaceX shares into the next Tesla. The engineers, AI or aerospace, who Musk needs to achieve his goals may find the shift jarring. But the vision is one way to explain what xAI is about, other than an LLM perhaps best known <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/coalition-demands-federal-grok-ban-over-nonconsensual-sexual-content/\">as a pervert</a>.

His staff was overwhelmed by the manual complexity of sourcing suppliers, negotiating pricing, tracking orders, and managing payments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I found myself running this big team that was not really set up for success,” he said. He sold Markai in 2023, just as it was becoming clear that generative AI could streamline the most time-consuming procurement hurdles for manufacturers and distributors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Later that year, Spencer launched <a href=\"https://www.didero.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Didero</a> with Lorenz Pallhuber (pictured center), a veteran of McKinsey’s procurement practice, and Tom Petit, the former technical co-founder of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/landis-grabs-40m-to-turn-renters-into-homeowners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Landis</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Didero, whose mission is to automate many of the complexities of global procurement, just raised a $30 million Series A co-led by Chemistry and Headline, with participation from Microsoft’s venture fund M12.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Global trade runs on natural language communication,” Spencer said. “It’s emails, WeChat, phone calls, purchase orders, and packing lists.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until the advent of generative AI, these fragmented pieces had to be tracked by humans who spent their days chasing suppliers and manually updating systems of record. Didero claims its platform can ingest that communication, putting a significant portion of the procurement workflow on autopilot.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Didero functions as an agentic AI layer that sits on top of a company’s existing ERP, acting as a coordinator that reads incoming communications and automatically executes the necessary updates and tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The goal is to go from ‘I need a good’ to payment without having to lift a finger,” Spencer said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike Levelpath, Zip, or Oro Labs, which use AI to streamline corporate purchasing, Didero focuses on the supply chain. Its platform is designed for manufacturers and distributors who need to source raw materials and inputs required to build or sell their products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Didero has a few smaller competitors that can handle some of the tasks that the company does. <span>For instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/cavela-lands-6-6m-to-help-brands-beat-pre-tariff-manufacturing-costs/\" target=\"_blank\">Cavela</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/pietra-creators-dtc-commerce/\" target=\"_blank\">Pietra</a> help brands source and negotiate pricing with manufacturers, but according to Spencer, these companies serve </span>small and medium-sized companies and don’t handle the full procurement process, from the first quote to the final payment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Didero has dozens of customers but named only one, <a href=\"https://www.footprintus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Footprint</a>, a provider of sustainable, plant-based packaging.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Until now, anyone wanting to watch YouTube on the headset has missed out on helpful features like offline downloads — making it much less useful for travel or offline viewing. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To fill the gap, third-party options, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/juno-the-youtube-app-for-vision-pro-pulled-from-app-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Juno</a>, briefly appeared on visionOS before being removed for violating YouTube’s Terms of Service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today’s announcement changes the game, allowing users to enjoy their favorite content — including all standard videos and YouTube Shorts —on a theater-sized virtual screen in a fully immersive environment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Standout features include a Spatial tab that lets users discover spatial videos, including 3D, VR180, and 360-degree formats. For consumers with the latest Apple Vision Pro models powered by the M5 chip, the app supports 8K playback, a notable upgrade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, users can interact with the new visionOS app using gesture controls, such as resizing windows or scrubbing through videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of this app’s release is interesting, as YouTube initially hesitated to invest in a dedicated visionOS experience, possibly waiting to gauge the headset’s traction. Most major streaming services have offered native experiences on the platform since launch, including Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount, and Peacock, among others. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another reason why YouTube’s decision to launch the app now is interesting is that the initial hype surrounding the headset appears to have diminished. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the Apple Vision Pro introducing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/apple-brings-apple-intelligence-to-the-vision-pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple Intelligence-powered features</a> almost a year ago, user engagement with the headset has reportedly been lukewarm.

He was still listed on both pages as of last week. Iozzo had been on the Black Hat review board since 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement shared with TechCrunch through a spokesperson, Iozzo said he told Black Hat that he “will not willingly resign” and welcomed “a full investigation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spokespeople for Black Hat did not respond to requests for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iozzo, currently the founder and chief executive of cybersecurity startup SlashID, has had a long career in the industry. Iozzo authored one of the first manuals for hackers researching Apple’s mobile software, and in 2015, founded cybersecurity startup IperLane, which was later bought by CrowdStrike, leading him to serve as a senior director at the company for almost four years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iozzo’s name appears in more than 2,300 documents, some of which contain <a href=\"https://jmail.world/search?q=%22iozzo%22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">several emails</a>, released on January 30 as part of the Department of Justice’s legally required effort to publish materials from its investigation into the late financier and sex trafficker. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iozzo’s interactions with Epstein span from October 2014 until December 2018. In late 2018, the Miami Herald <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article221404845.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published news stories</a> <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">detailing allegations</a> that Epstein <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">abused more than 60 women</a>, some of them teenage girls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After these stories were published, newly released <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02263876.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">emails show</a> Iozzo was trying to meet with Epstein at his New York town house.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Epstein’s connections in the cybersecurity world??

However, some of the identifying details included in the document strongly suggest that the informant believed Iozzo was Epstein’s hacker. Italian newspaper <a href=\"https://www.corriere.it/tecnologia/26_febbraio_01/hacker-italiano-epstein-files-84f975f4-415c-45c7-b22d-bb28ea2fexlk.shtml?refresh_ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Il Corriere della Sera</a> reported on the emails earlier this month and named Iozzo as the person likely redacted in the informant document. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s important to note that the claims and allegations by the FBI informant were not confirmed by the FBI and may be partially wrong. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the emails that suggests Iozzo did anything unlawful for Epstein.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iozzo said in his statement to TechCrunch that he “knew Epstein for professional reasons” and that he wished he had not, but he denied claims that he was Epstein’s hacker or did any hacking for him. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were introduced in 2014 when I was a 25-year-old at MIT fundraising for my startup, by people whom I trusted and admired. Because of this, I failed to ask the right questions that, in retrospect, seem obvious,” read the statement, sent by his spokesperson Joan Vollero. “I foolishly accepted the narrative that was presented to me by others that greatly minimized the magnitude of his horrific actions. I regret the past association and take full responsibility for not exercising greater judgment at the time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My interactions with Epstein were limited to business opportunities that never materialized, as well as discussions of the markets and emerging technologies. I never observed nor participated in any illegal activity or behavior,” Iozzo added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2008, Epstein <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/02/usa.internationalcrime1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pleaded guilty to soliciting sex</a> from girls as young as 14 and registered as a sex offender in Florida and New York. In 2018, new reports emerged that Epstein was allegedly a serial sex abuser and had trafficked underage girls at his private island. After these new reports, the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">formally charged</a> Epstein in 2019 of trafficking, exploiting, and abusing dozens of underage girls. Epstein later <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/27/1184380805/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-department\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">died</a> in jail. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neither Iozzo’s spokesperson Vollero, nor his attorney Emma Spiro, explained why Iozzo was removed from Black Hat’s website, but did not dispute the removal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mr. Iozzo welcomed an independent investigation from Black Hat, rather than a knee-jerk removal decision, because he is confident that he would be cleared through that process,” said Vollero.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Code Blue spokesperson Ken-ichi Saito confirmed to TechCrunch that the conference removed Iozzo’s name from its review board. Saito said the conference had been “preparing for this update for several months” to remove Iozzo and two other review board members “who had not been active” and that the “the timing of our website update coincidentally overlapped with the public release of the Epstein documents.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company now claims that Mullenweg intended to target 10 different hosting companies with royalty payments for their use of the WordPress trademark and tried to get payment processor Stripe to cancel its contract with WP Engine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the heart of the dispute, Mullenweg believes WP Engine is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/matt-mullenweg-calls-wp-engine-a-cancer-to-wordpress-and-urges-community-to-switch-providers/\">profiting</a> from the open source WordPress project without contributing back to the community, and demanded the hosting company pay 8% of its monthly gross revenues as a royalty fee for using the WordPress brand.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The suit, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/wp-engine-sues-automattic-and-wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg/\">originally filed</a> by WP Engine in <a href=\"https://automattic.com/2024/10/31/legal-response-to-wp-engine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">October 2024</a>, accused Automattic and Mullenweg of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/12/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/\">defamation and abuse of power</a>. Automattic filed its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/24/automattic-files-counterclaims-against-wp-engine-in-wordpress-lawsuit-alleging-trademark-misuse/\">counterclaims</a> last year, alleging that the hosting company has been abusing the WordPress trademark and engaging in deceptive marketing practices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this latest filing, WP Engine has amended its complaint for the third time after gaining access to information that was uncovered during the discovery process. The information, now unredacted, had been previously sealed at Automattic’s request.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, one of the new claims accuses Automattic of allegedly planning to target 10 other competitors with royalty claims similar to those aimed at WP Engine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The complaint also states that Newfold, a company whose portfolio includes hosting providers like Bluehost and HostGator, among others, is already paying Automattic for use of its trademarks and that Automattic is in conversations with others. (Names of the other hosts were redacted in the complaint, which referenced email conversations between those companies and Mullenweg.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WP Engine is also alleging that Mullenweg reached out to a Stripe executive via email to pressure the company to cancel WP Engine’s contract. This occurred after WP Engine had filed its lawsuit against Automattic, the complaint states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The filing also challenges the 8% rate for the royalty payments as being somewhat arbitrary. Referencing Mullenweg’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg-says-a-fork-would-be-fantastic/\">comments at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024</a>, WP Engine claims that the Automattic founder essentially came up with the rate because it was what he thought WP Engine “could afford to pay.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Matt Mullenweg: The Future of WordPress and the Web | TechCrunch Disrupt 2024\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn_HzfI_sW0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Disrupt, Mullenweg had responded to a question about how he settled on the 8% fee by saying it was based on a “business analysis.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you estimate that would be about $32 million — they still would have been free cash-flow positive, and based on our estimates, and the negotiations over the past 18 months, we felt like that was a fair amount,” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn_HzfI_sW0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">he said at the event.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other new claims in the filing point to aggressive language Mullenweg allegedly used against WP Engine, like threats that if the web hosting provider didn’t comply, he would start stealing its customers. “If they don’t take the carrot, we’ll give them the stick,” was one of the quotes cited from internal correspondence at Automattic, for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The complaint also includes allegations that Mullenweg used the term “nuclear war” to describe his approach to WP Engine’s defiance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked about the new filing, Automattic shared the following statement with TechCrunch: “There is nothing new here. This is the same narrative WP Engine has been pushing for over a year, and the Court has already dismissed many of its central claims. The lawsuit is going nowhere. This latest filing simply repackages the same tired allegations in an effort to keep the story alive. WP Engine is trying to recast robust competition as something nefarious. We are confident the courts will continue to reject that theory.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated after publication with Automattic’s statement. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That seems to be the case for Spotify at least, which shared this week during <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/spotify-hits-a-record-751m-monthly-users-thanks-to-wrapped-new-free-features/\">its fourth-quarter earnings call</a> that the best developers at the company “have not written a single line of code since December.” That statement, from Spotify co-CEO Gustav Söderström, came alongside other comments about how the company is using AI to accelerate development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of note, Spotify pointed out it shipped more than 50 new features and changes to its streaming app throughout 2025. And, most recently, it has rolled out more features, like AI-powered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/spotify-brings-ai-powered-prompted-playlists-to-the-u-s-and-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Prompted Playlists</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/spotify-ventures-into-physical-book-sales-adds-new-audiobook-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Page Match</a> for audiobooks, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/spotifys-new-feature-lets-you-explore-the-story-behind-the-song-youre-listening-to/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">About This Song</a>, which all launched within the past few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Spotify, engineers are using an internal system called “Honk” to speed up coding and product velocity, the company told analysts on the call. This system allows for things like remote, real-time code deployment using generative AI, and specifically Claude Code. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a concrete example, an engineer at Spotify on their morning commute from Slack on their cell phone can tell Claude to fix a bug or add a new feature to the iOS app,” Söderström said. “And once Claude finishes that work, the engineer then gets a new version of the app, pushed to them on Slack on their phone, so that he can then merge it to production, all before they even arrive at the office.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify credited the system in helping to speed up coding and deployment “tremendously.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We foresee this not being the end of the line in terms of AI development, just the beginning,” Söderström said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec also touted Spotify’s ability to build a unique dataset that other LLMs could not commoditize, the way they could other online resources, like Wikipedia. That’s because there’s not always a factual answer for music-related questions, he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if you asked what workout music is, you’d get different answers from different people, sometimes based on their geography. Americans tend to prefer hip-hop overall, though millions prefer death metal. And while a number of Europeans would work out to EDM, many Scandinavians like heavy metal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a dataset that we are building right now that no one else is really building. It does not exist at this scale. And we see it improving every time we retrain our models,” Söderström noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Analysts on the call also asked about Spotify’s approach to AI-generated music. The company explained that it’s allowing artists and labels to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/spotify-updates-ai-policy-to-label-tracks-cut-down-on-spam/\">indicate in a track’s metadata</a> how the song was made but is still policing the platform for spam.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is described by the company as a “smaller version” of that model, one that is designed for faster inference. To power that inference, OpenAI has brought in a dedicated chip from its hardware partner Cerebras, marking a new level of integration in the company’s physical infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/cerebras-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnership</a> between Cerebras and OpenAI was announced last month, when OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/openai-signs-deal-reportedly-worth-10-billion-for-compute-from-cerebras/\">said that</a> it had reached a multi-year agreement with the firm worth over $10 billion. “Integrating Cerebras into our mix of compute solutions is all about making our AI respond much faster,” the company said at the time. Now, OpenAI calls Spark the “first milestone” in that relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spark, which OpenAI says is designed for swift, real-time collaboration and “rapid iteration,” will be powered by Cerebras’ Wafer Scale Engine 3. The WSE-3 is Cerebras’ <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-chip-cs3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">third-generation</a> waferscale megachip, decked out with 4 trillion transistors. OpenAI describes the new lightweight tool as a “daily productivity driver, helping users with rapid prototyping” rather than the longer, heavier tasks that the original 5.3 is designed for. Spark is currently enjoying a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users in the Codex app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2021984777470193767\">tweet</a> in advance of the announcement, CEO Sam Altman seemed to hint at the new model. “We have a special thing launching to Codex users on the Pro plan later today,” Altman tweeted. “It sparks joy for me.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its official statement, OpenAI emphasized Spark as designed for the lowest possible latency on Codex. “Codex-Spark is the first step toward a Codex that works in two complementary modes: real-time collaboration when you want rapid iteration, and long-running tasks when you need deeper reasoning and execution,” OpenAI shared. The company added that Cerebras’ chips excel at assisting “workflows that demand extremely low latency.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras has been around <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">for over a decade</a> but, in the AI era, it has enjoyed an increasingly prominent role in the tech industry. Just last week, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/benchmark-raises-225m-in-special-funds-to-double-down-on-cerebras/\">announced that</a> it had raised $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/press-release/cerebras-systems-raises-usd1-billion-series-h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$23 billion</a>.

Human truck drivers take much longer to complete the same distance due to federal regulations that limit how long they can be behind the wheel. For instance, truck drivers must stop for a 30-minute break after eight hours and can operate a semitruck for a maximum of 11 hours at a time, according to federal regulations. Once drivers hit that threshold, they cannot get behind the wheel for another 10 hours. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This represents more than a technological achievement,” Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson said during the company’s earnings call Wednesday afternoon. “It is the dawn of a superhuman future for freight.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also offers compelling economics to its customers, which includes Uber Freight, Werner, FedEx, and Schneider. The company said that eventually it can cut transit times nearly in half, a stat that has won over companies like Hirschbach, an early customer on the Fort Worth-to-Phoenix route. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora said in a <a href=\"https://ir.aurora.tech/_assets/_34bf7c715e4760047d5e07c538ed5bb5/aurora/db/956/10012/shareholder_letter/25Q4+Shareholder+Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">letter to shareholders</a> that it is poised to expand across the Sun Belt of the United States. Today, the company operates driverless trucks — some with a human observer still in the cab — on routes between Dallas and Houston, Fort Worth and El Paso, El Paso and Phoenix, Fort Worth and Phoenix, and Laredo and Dallas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion has helped Aurora transition from a developer of autonomous trucks to a commercial operator who is earning money on its driverless routes. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora has brought in revenue since April 2025 when it first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/aurora-launches-commercial-self-driving-truck-service-in-texas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deployed driverless, heavy-duty trucks for commercial use</a> on public roads.

The company’s CFO, David Maday, said total year adjusted revenue, which includes money earned through pilot programs early last year, was $4 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s a tiny figure, especially when compared to its expenses. Aurora reported a net income loss of $816 million in 2025, up 9% from the year before as it focuses on scaling its operations. Still, it shows measurable progress from 2024, when it didn’t recognize any revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revenue is projected to continue as the company adds more trucks and driverless routes to its network. Today, the company has 30 trucks in the fleet, 10 of which are operating driverlessly. That fleet is expected to grow to more than 200 trucks by the end of the year. Urmson said the company’s trucks have racked up 250,000 driverless miles as of January 2026 with a perfect safety record.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the second quarter, Aurora plans to deploy a fleet of driverless International Motors LT trucks, which will not have a human observer on board. Aurora’s driverless operations that use Paccar trucks currently have a human safety observer in the cab as requested by the truck manufacturer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Urmson took a bullish view of Aurora’s future, buoyed by advancements in its self-driving software, an impending second-generation hardware kit that will lower costs, and expansion of its driverless routes. The expansion of its driverless trucking routes has been propelled by a new software release, its fourth since launching commercial service in April 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first release validated initial driverless operations between Dallas and Houston, the second validated operations at night, and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/aurora-expands-self-driving-trucks-route-to-el-paso/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">third validated El Paso</a>, according to Aurora. The company said this latest software release will give its self-driving system the capabilities to navigate the diverse geography and climate of the southern United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just as the last two years brought robotaxis into the mainstream, we expect 2026 to mark the inflection point where the market recognizes that self-driving trucks have arrived and are quickly becoming a permanent fixture in our transportation landscape,” Urmson said on the company’s earnings call. “If you’re in the Sun Belt in 2026, you won’t just read about the Aurora driver. You’ll see it every day.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora currently operates driverless routes through Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and has future driverless operations planned for Nevada, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, the company said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On January 23, 2026, U.S. investment firms Greenoaks and Altimeter <a href=\"https://www.immigration.go.kr/bbs/moj/183/602757/artclView.do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a notice</a> with South Korea’s Ministry of Justice, saying they suffered losses from what they characterized as the government’s discriminatory investigation into the data breach. They said they plan to pursue investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS) arbitration under the U.S.-Korea FTA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea’s Ministry of Justice <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moj.go.kr/moj/222/subview.do?enc=Zm5jdDF8QEB8JTJGYmJzJTJGbW9qJTJGMTgzJTJGNjAzNDc2JTJGYXJ0Y2xWaWV3LmRvJTNGcGFzc3dvcmQlM0QlMjZyZ3NCZ25kZVN0ciUzRCUyNmJic0NsU2VxJTNEJTI2cmdzRW5kZGVTdHIlM0QlMjZpc1ZpZXdNaW5lJTNEZmFsc2UlMjZwYWdlJTNEMSUyNmJic09wZW5XcmRTZXElM0QlMjZzcmNoQ29sdW1uJTNEJTI2c3JjaFdyZCUzRCUyNg%3D%3D\">said</a> Thursday that three more investors, including Abrams Capital, Durable Capital Partners, and Foxhaven Asset Management have now joined the case. They are alleging the government acted unlawfully toward the e-commerce company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To recap the incident: In December, Coupang disclosed that nearly 34 million Korean customers’ personal information had been leaked in a data breach that had been going on for more than five months. The breach involved customer names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and certain order histories, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While other tech breaches in Korea resulted in less severe penalties, Coupang has faced extraordinary government pressure. The government reportedly threatened <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/companies/20251201/coupang-faces-potential-770-mil-fine-after-data-breach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">massive fines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/companies/20251221/coupang-faces-possible-business-suspension-after-massive-data-breach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suspension of operations</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/companies/20260112/police-mull-overseas-travel-ban-on-coupang-chief-in-data-breach-investigation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">travel bans</a> for executives while Coupang’s investors allege it also sought <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.sedaily.com/society/2025/12/31/labor-minister-warns-officials-against-contact-with-ex\">to block public communication</a> and repeatedly misrepresented the scope of the breach.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Korea’s Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) said that more than 30 million Coupang accounts were exposed — but the facts point to just 3,000 affected accounts, according to Coupang’s investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, South Korea’s government and the <a href=\"https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/12/17/NXHCHEF2B5BWTB5WZ5UGYKYU4A/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PIPC said</a> the Coupang breach was serious enough to justify higher fines. Under current law, penalties are capped at 3% of revenue, more than $800 million for Coupang, according to the U.S. investors, but some lawmakers have proposed raising the limit to 10% and applying it retroactively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if the new law passes, it wouldn’t apply to Coupang, since the breach occurred before the rules changed. But a Democratic Party lawmaker in the country suggested imposing punitive fines, through either new legislation or a special parliamentary act, and PIPC backed the idea, <a href=\"https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20251217_0003445328\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per news reports</a>.  South Korean president Lee Jae Myung also <a href=\"https://v.daum.net/v/20260110090249624#:~:text=2025%EB%85%84%2012%EC%9B%94%2011%EC%9D%BC%2C%20%EA%B8%B0%ED%9A%8D%EC%9E%AC%EC%A0%95%EB%B6%80%20%EC%97%85%EB%AC%B4%EB%B3%B4%EA%B3%A0%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C%20%EC%9D%B4%EC%9E%AC%EB%AA%85%20%EB%8C%80%ED%86%B5%EB%A0%B9%EC%9D%B4,%EC%9C%A0%EC%B6%9C%EB%90%9C%20%EC%82%AC%EA%B1%B4%EC%9D%84%20%EB%91%90%EA%B3%A0%20%EA%B0%95%EA%B2%BD%20%EB%8C%80%EC%9D%91%EC%9D%84%20%EC%9A%94%EA%B5%AC%ED%95%9C%20%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%B4%EB%8B%A4.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">publicly</a> <a href=\"http://www.marketnews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=73489\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called for heavy penalties</a>, suggesting the company had not faced sufficient consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on the <a href=\"https://www.moj.go.kr/bbs/moj/439/603008/artclView.do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">notice of intent filing</a> released by the investors’ legal adviser, the investors argue that the South Korean government’s actions constitute an “unprecedented assault” on Coupang. In the filing, they argue:  </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Government’s unprecedented assault on a U.S. company to benefit its Korean and Chinese competitors is an egregious violation of the Treaty, principles of international law, and the historic partnership between Korea and the United States … The Government’s shocking conduct has left the U.S. investors with no choice. If the Government does not immediately cease its attacks against Coupang, fully restore the company’s ability to operate its business, and permanently end its longstanding campaign of discrimination against the company, then the U.S. investors will be forced to seek billions of dollars in damages from Korea to protect their investments in Coupang and remedy the Government’s ongoing Treaty violations, including attempted expropriation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The filing is a preliminary, pre-litigation step. South Korea’s <a href=\"https://www.moj.go.kr/bbs/moj/439/603008/artclView.do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ministry of Justice</a> is now reviewing the notice of intent, which kicks off <a href=\"https://cil.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SIAA-Day3-AndreaMenaker-Pre-arbitration-Requirements.pdf#:~:text=notice%20of%20its%20intention%20to%20submit%20a%20claim%20to%20arbitration%20at%20least%2090&amp;text=%E2%80%A2%20%E2%80%9CRequest%20for%20consultations%E2%80%9D%20triggers%206%2Dmonth%20period.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a mandatory 90-day consultation period</a> before formal arbitration can begin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coupang, Abrams Capital, and Foxhaven Asset Management did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Durable Capital Partners could not be reached.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the investors’ filing, South Korea’s handling of data breaches has been inconsistent, specifically citing other recent data breaches in South Korea, including KakaoPay, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/a-timeline-of-south-korean-telco-giant-skts-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SK Telecom</a>, Upbit, and Alibaba’s AliExpress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">KakaoPay reportedly transferred 54 billion customer records to Alipay Singapore, yet faced <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/economy/20250409/fss-fines-kakao-pay-10-mil-for-illegally-transferring-customer-data-to-alipay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">only a $10 million fine</a> and a CEO warning, while <a href=\"https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20260119009200315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SK Telecom was fined $91 million</a> after a massive SIM card breach. <a href=\"https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/south-korean-police-probe-30-million-upbit-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Upbit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/e-commerce/newsView/ked202407250013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AliExpress</a> also saw minimal government action. The investors say these examples underscore the stark contrast with the government’s response to Coupang.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT said Wednesday that the Coupang data breach was carried out by a former employee who had worked on the company’s authentication systems and was aware of vulnerabilities in both the authentication framework and key management system. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Ministry alleges that Coupang failed to report the breach to the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency (KISA) within 24 hours and did not fully implement a November 2025 data preservation order, leading to the deletion of key web and app access logs. The ministry has referred the matter to investigators and ordered Coupang to submit a prevention plan by February 2026, with compliance monitored through July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coupang <a href=\"https://www.aboutcoupang.com/English/news/news-details/2026/response-to-the-jit-report-regarding-the-november-2025-data-incident/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released a statement</a>, saying that the employee, a Chinese national, accessed data from over 33 million accounts but retained only about 3,000 before deleting it, and that no sensitive info such as payment data, passwords, or government IDs was accessed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coupang also replaced its CEO, Park Dae-jun, with Harold Rogers, its U.S. parent’s top lawyer, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/ceo-of-south-korean-retail-giant-coupang-resigns-after-massive-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in December</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adam Farrar, senior associate at CSIS and senior geoeconomics analyst for APAC at Bloomberg, said on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV8JR9df8U8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tuesday’s Impossible State podcast</a> that what began as a major data breach involving Coupang has grown into a broader issue between the United States and South Korea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Farrar said that the case is amplifying broader U.S. claims of unfair treatment toward American technology firms, raising trade and tariff risks for South Korea as <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-news-world/congress-targets-south-korean-regulators-over-discriminatory-treatment-us-tech-companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the U.S. Congress</a> becomes increasingly engaged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The massive data breach [by Coupang] led to a series of investigations in the National Assembly and some very combative back and forth with Coupang and a series of executives over the past several months,” Farrar said in the podcast. “The additional dynamic here is that Coupang, while driving almost all of its earnings from Korea, is now a U.S.-based company that adds to the dynamic on both sides, impacting how they’re perceived and seen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue extends beyond Coupang, raising broader questions about whether South Korea is unfairly targeting U.S. companies, Farrar continued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Critics point to digital policies they say favor domestic firms, including network usage fees on content providers like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/south-korean-isp-sk-broadband-counterclaims-against-netflix-for-bandwidth-usage-fees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/google-apple-face-fines-in-south-korea-for-breaching-in-app-billing-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple’s App Store and Google Play</a> payment rules, and data localization requirements that limit services like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/seoul-weighs-approval-for-google-apple-high-resolution-map-requests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Maps</a> on national security grounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Under the deal, which was worth just under $70 million, Apple’s in-house studio will be producing the show’s future seasons. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is similar to one Apple struck with AMC Studios for sci-fi show “Silo” after season one. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Severance” will now be one of Apple’s marquee titles, joining popular series such as “Your Friends and Neighbors” and “Stick.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Deadline, the production costs for “Severance” had exceeded what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already requested advances from Apple and was considering relocating production from New York to Canada for bigger and quicker tax rebates. Since Apple definitely has the funds to back the show, the company decided to take full control.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Severance” is important to the streamer, as the show’s second season became Apple’s most-watched series at the time.

Trump has criticized Big Tech, especially Apple, for manufacturing its devices in China, but after Cook promised to spend <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/apple-to-announce-100b-further-commitment-for-u-s-manufacturing/\">more than $600 billion</a> over the next four years stateside and moved to mend fences, relations between the administration and the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/big-tech-is-paying-for-trumps-white-house-ballroom/\">have improved</a>. Apple also <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/07/tech/trump-india-tariffs-apple-iphone-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dodged</a> planned tariffs on smartphones made overseas and imported into the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FTC last year also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/trumps-ftc-is-looking-into-censorship-on-tech-platforms/\">launched</a> an investigation into “censorship by tech platforms,” seeking input from the public who felt they were silenced due to their political ideologies or affiliations. “Tech firms should not be bullying their users,” Ferguson said at the time. “This inquiry will help the FTC better understand how these firms may have violated the law by silencing and intimidating Americans for speaking their minds.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company, which bills itself as the first “AI-native, full-stack auto retail business” for electric vehicles, already has thousands of customers buying and selling their EVs on the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now it’s looking to scale with help from a $31 million Series A funding round led by Eclipse, with Ibex Investors, Lifeline Ventures, and JIMCO — the investment arm of the Saudi Arabian Jameel family (an early investor in Rivian) — as co-investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last decade, companies like Carvana and CarMax helped usher in the digital car-buying experience. More recently, myriad startups have tried to improve the car-buying experience with AI, pitching ideas like voice agents or smarter scheduling software. Eclipse’s Jiten Behl thinks this is the wrong approach if you want to really modernize the automotive retail experience, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These bolt-on AI tools are band-aids,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch. He likened it to how many major automakers’ first EVs were essentially combustion vehicles that were repackaged to fit electric drivetrains. That approach came with major tradeoffs compared to designing a new EV from the ground up, which was the approach companies like Tesla and Rivian took.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Auto retail is a perfect candidate for disrupting with AI, you know? It’s a lot of process, lot of labor, [very] rules-based,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lasse-Mathias Nyberg, Ever co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that buying or selling a car typically triggers “hundreds or thousands of different actions” that a retailer needs to perform in order to complete the transaction. “There’s massive complexities or frictions on both sides.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, he and his team set out to reduce or remove those complexities. What they settled on after a year of research was a digital-first auto retailer. The core tech is an orchestration layer or “operating system” that can handle all the different workflows behind a transaction, whether it’s processing information submitted by a prospective buyer or seller, or managing the vehicle inventory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you do appraisals, or pricing, or titling, it’s very deterministic in terms of what steps need to be taken. And today, there are lots of single point solution tools that are used,” he said. Most companies “use these tools together in a very inefficient manner, and you think that you are on a digital journey — but if you actually could clean-sheet it, and if you actually could use the power of agentic AI, and you can create one unified customer experience and remove all these micro-frictions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nyberg claimed that building the company this way has allowed Ever’s sales team to be two to three times more productive than they would be otherwise, and he expects that to scale as the company grows. He said this extra efficiency and productivity beefs up their margins, which can be booked as profit or passed along to the customer by offering lower prices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ever applies this fresh approach to both its online marketplace and physical locations. Nyberg said the hybrid model is important because seeing and trying a car in person remains crucial to the shopping experience for a lot of buyers — especially those who might be assessing EVs for the first time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early reviews of Ever’s product have been mixed. Users on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/electriccars/comments/1jykj9z/has_anyone_ever_bought_from_evercarscom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one particular Reddit thread</a> from last year were split, with some drawn to how Ever is making EVs easier to buy, while others detailed struggles getting in touch with the startup’s team. Ever was just getting off the ground and was more or less operating in stealth, and so Nyberg chalks that up to a learning experience. He said his team is working hard to make sure its system can be flexible enough to accomplish everything the company has set out to do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger challenge may be overall interest in EVs, which has cooled a bit in the United States. Nyberg said he hasn’t ruled out Ever buying or selling used combustion cars in the future, but wants to stick to EVs in the near-term since there isn’t a retailer that is laser-focused on these vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Behl, who spent eight years on Rivian’s leadership team, admitted he’s a “hopeless romantic when it comes to EVs,” and said he still believes the industry is moving toward electric propulsion because of the inherent benefits. And he said his “first thought” when he started doing diligence on Ever was: “I wish Rivian was doing this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More broadly, Behl said, companies like Carvana are still in the single digits of market share when it comes to automotive retail. That’s why he sees so much upside in Ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Customers are going to continue to gravitate towards better experience when it comes to buying cars, which means it is going to be a digitally-led customer experience which takes away all the friction of buying and selling a car,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
