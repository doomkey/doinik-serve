This year, Spotify is doubling down on what it knows works best: deep dives into your streaming data, creative experiences, messages from favorite artists, and other social features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims that Wrapped 2025 is its biggest, as it’s introducing nearly a dozen new features in addition to its old standbys, like top songs and artists. Plus, it’s offering more visibility into users’ data than in years past. For the first time, Spotify Wrapped is adding a live multiplayer feature to compare your listening data with friends.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wrapped Party, Wrapped’s first live interactive experience, allows you to invite up to nine friends to compare listening stats.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

And what we tried to build was the most creative, most innovative, most engaging Wrapped ever,” he added, setting a high bar for the 2025 edition of the now 11-year-old annual year-in-review feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re the original and, we believe, still the best,” Luhks said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071967\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, AI was a part of the Wrapped experience. Though the company claims the overall experience was not made with AI, it does leverage a LLM (large language model) to add a storytelling layer to Wrapped’s facts and figures, and natural language summaries in other parts of its experience, looking back on your data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify’s attempt to fix Wrapped after a notable stumble comes as the streamer faces increased competition from Apple, Amazon, YouTube, and others, which have all launched their own annual review features, inspired by Wrapped. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everyone seems to have their own version of Wrapped. Now, there’s a lot of reviews and replays and rewinds out there, but we believe that Wrapped still sets the bar for these year-end recaps,” Luhks said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with the consumer experience, Spotify shared its top artists, songs, albums, podcasts, and audiobooks for the year, with top winners that included, respectively, Bad Bunny (top song and album), Joe Rogan (“The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast), and Rebeca Yarros (author of “Fourth Wing”). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new round, which opens on December 10, will enable consumers to buy the company’s shares at its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/nothing-closes-200m-series-c-led-by-tiger-global-plans-ai-first-device-launch/\">Series C valuation of $1.3 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it has so far raised $8 million in total from over 8,000 people across two previous community investment rounds. It held its first community <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/want-to-invest-in-nothing-carl-pei-opens-investment-opportunity-to-community/\">funding event in 2021, aiming to raise $1.5 million</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This isn’t about raising capital, it’s about giving our community/fans a chance to invest while we’re private and join us on the journey,” a spokesperson for Nothing told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Community investors have a rotating seat on the company’s board, but it is unclear what else they get for investing in the company through such rounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nothing raised $200 million in its Series C back in September from investors including Tiger Global, GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF and Tapestry. The company has raised $450 million to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The community round comes as Nothing makes changes to its corporate structure as it tries to increase its share of a smartphone market dominated by giants like Samsung and Apple. The company is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/smartphone-maker-nothing-to-spin-off-its-affordable-cmf-brand/\">spinning off its budget CMF brand</a>, and plans to explore AI-centric devices while it keeps building smartphones and audio products. And Nothing claims it crossed $1 billion in cumulative revenue this year, up 150% from 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is working to be “IPO-ready” in three years, CEO Carl Pei told TechCrunch in an email. “The timing will depend on market conditions and what makes sense for the business at that point in time,” he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What’s important is that we’re already operating with that discipline now.

News of the mandate soon ignited concerns over privacy and state overreach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, the government has decided not to make pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” the ministry said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the government has not yet issued an official notification to smartphone makers reflecting the withdrawal, and manufacturers are still waiting for formal instructions, two manufacturer sources involved with the proceedings told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its release in January 2025, Sanchar Saathi has so far been downloaded 14 million times, and contributes information on roughly 2,000 cyber-fraud incidents per day, per the Indian government. The recent controversy boosted interest in the platform, and the ministry noted that about 600,000 citizens registered to download the app on December 2 alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The telecom ministry’s notice follows much confusion over whether the app was truly voluntary, as the government claimed. Telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia had <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/JM_Scindia/status/1995772731455926362\">insisted</a> earlier this week that users could delete Sanchar Saathi at any time, even though the directive circulating among manufacturers stated that the app’s functionalities “must not be disabled or restricted.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conflicting signals fueled criticism that the government was attempting to downplay the extent of its mandate. Critics warned that forcing a government app onto every smartphone, and preventing its features from being disabled would give authorities excessive visibility into users’ devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The directive had also raised concerns within the industry, with manufacturers privately questioning the feasibility of enforcing a permanent, system-level app without clear legal backing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deputy telecom minister Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/aseemmanchanda/status/1995824109465600365\">said</a> in media interviews that Apple did not participate in the working group for the initiative, though other smartphone makers did.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sanchar Saathi had more than 3 million monthly active users in November, according to marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Web traffic to Sanchar Saathi has also surged, with monthly unique visitors rising by more than 49% year-over-year, per Sensor Tower.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Internet Freedom Foundation, a New Delhi-based digital rights group, called the reversal a “welcome development,” but <a href=\"https://x.com/internetfreedom/status/1996160746753765423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">urged caution</a>, noting that it is still awaiting the legal order that should accompany the announcement. The group added that “cautious optimism, not closure,” was warranted until revised directions under the Cyber Security Rules, 2024, are published and independently verified.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other parts of the Sanchar Saathi ecosystem continue to expand. Recommerce and trade-in platforms are still required to validate devices through a central IMEI database, and the telecom ministry is also piloting an API that could allow these firms to submit customer and device information directly to the state. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The service comes with a few caveats, however, including the addition of a human safety operator behind the wheel, and a limited operating area. The companies said fully driverless operations, without a safety operator, will begin in the future and the service area will expand.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Uber, the launch closes out a year of rapid dealmaking — and deployments — with a variety of autonomous vehicle technology companies, including Waymo, China’s WeRide and San Francisco-based startup Nuro. To date, Uber has locked in 20 partnerships with AV companies across freight, delivery and robotaxis, some of which are now in commercial operation. Uber offers autonomous vehicles through its ride-hailing app in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/uber-and-werides-robotaxi-service-in-abu-dhabi-is-officially-driverless/\">Abu Dhabi and Riyadh with WeRide</a>, and in Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix with Waymo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber said it plans to have autonomous vehicles on its network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. Over the next two years, the plan is to launch AVs on its app in Arlington, Texas, Dubai, London, Los Angeles, Munich and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of these partnerships have included an investment by Uber, and Avride, an Austin-based startup that sits under parent company Nebius Group, is one of those.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October 2024, the ride-hailing company struck a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/uber-taps-yandex-spinout-avride-for-autonomous-delivery-and-ride-hail-partnership/\">multi-year deal</a> with Avride to bring its sidewalk delivery robots and autonomous vehicles to both Uber Eats and Uber. Within months, Avride’s sidewalk robots began delivering food via the Uber Eats app in Austin, Dallas and Jersey City.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This fall, Avride secured strategic investments and commercial commitments worth $375 million from Uber and Nebius, which was previously known as Yandex NV, the Netherlands-based company that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/05/yandex-to-sell-its-remaining-russian-businesses-for-5-2b-half-its-market-value/\">sold off its Russian business</a> in 2024.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber’s use of Avride sidewalk robots for its food delivery business was notable, but this robotaxi launch has arguably higher stakes for both companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The robotaxi fleet of all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles is equipped with Avride’s self-driving system, and will service a 9-square-mile area of Dallas that includes downtown.

The match is not guaranteed, and riders can increase their chances of getting a robotaxi by changing a setting in the Uber app. Robotaxi rides will cost the same as those operated by a human driver, according to Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When an Uber user is notified they’ve been matched with an Avride robotaxi, they can choose to accept or switch to a human-driven ride. Once the robotaxi arrives, riders can use the Uber app to unlock the vehicle, open the trunk and start the trip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new goal is to create interfaces and modalities that make it easier for users to create a habit of logging their meals or workouts, along with having an ever-present AI assistant that can guide people in areas like nutrition and exercise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khosla-backed health startup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.healthifyme.com/in/\">Healthify</a> on Tuesday launched a new version of its health assistant Ria, which you can converse with live, via voice, and by using the camera for getting input about your food.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is using OpenAI’s tech to power this conversational mode. With this release, Ria supports more than 50 languages, including 14 Indian languages. The company said that it can also support mixed language input like Hinglish or Spanglish. While the company is largely utilizing OpenAI’s models for this release, it said that in the future it could use other models if needed.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071955\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Healthify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through the new version of Ria, users can ask for their health overview for specified time frames like day, week, or month, or an overall summary. The app can pull data from different sources like fitness trackers, sleep trackers, or glucose monitors to give users insights about exercise, sleep, readiness, and glucose spikes, and give suggestions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just like Google Gemini’s Live Conversation mode, you can point the camera to ask about different food items and their nutritional value, then log them. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Healthify App Demo AUG'25\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdjklamL25A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Healthify also showed off a demo of using Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to converse with Ria in real time and use the device’s camera to log food. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup believes its users will feel more comfortable chatting in real time with an assistant. Plus, they can do multiple things in one session, such as getting insights, generating an exercise plan, or logging their goals. If you forget to log your food for the day, you can describe your meals in one go instead of typing them out, and the assistant will log them for you.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, the company is looking to utilize its updated AI in more places. In the coming months, it plans to make the conversational assistant a central piece of user onboarding so it can gather more insights from unstructured conversations. (Notably, new-age dating apps have opted for this kind of interface to create better matches for users.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also creating a more persistent memory layer over OpenAI’s models and its assistant to have the app remember long-term context around preferences and health changes to give more personalized suggestions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Healthify is also making the assistant available in conversations with your coach or nutritionist to help either of you pull data or answer your questions when they are not available. Plus, it’s adding Ria to your calls with coaches and nutritionists so it can transcribe the calls for insights. Users or coaches can also ask Ria for data while they are on a call.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s CEO, Tushar Vashisht, said that the team trained Ria on years of conversational data between coaches and users to give grounded and accurate advice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apart from Healthify, other apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/former-whoop-execs-new-app-alma-uses-ai-for-all-things-nutrition/\">Alma</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/16/photo-calorie-app-cal-ai-downloaded-over-a-million-times-was-built-by-two-teenagers/\">Cal AI</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\">MyfitnessPal</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/workout-app-ladder-launches-nutrition-tracking-experience/\">Ladder</a> have created ways for users to input food intakes using voice, text, or images. Healthify believes that with its live conversation mode, data aggregation from various platforms, and AI trained on years of data, it has an edge over its competitors. What’s more, the company has added a way to access your gallery and automatically detect food photos to give you options for adding meals that you might have missed logging in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are focusing on creating a health ecosystem of nutrition-driven data with other integrations. From an AI perspective, we are putting in levers to solve for accountability in users when it comes to health,” the company’s CPO Paritosh Kumar told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Healthify, which has more than 45 million registered users and a few million active monthly users, is also launching a new AI plan in the U.S with updated Ria assistant and meal planning at $20 per month. Prior to this, the company had been testing various plans with text-based AI and certified nutrition coaches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it’s hoping to soon announce partnerships around its GLP-1-aided weight loss programs. In the coming months, Healthify also plans to partner with health tracking device companies to bring their data into Ria.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vashisht said the company may raise a new funding round in the near future, given its strong U.S. adoption and growth. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Here is a roundup of the announcements that got our attention. TechCrunch will continue to update this article through the end of AWS re:Invent, so be sure to check back.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-training-chip-and-nvidia-compatibility\">An AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS introduced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new version of its AI training chip</a> called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expanded-agentcore-capabilities\">Expanded AgentCore capabilities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-announces-new-capabilities-for-its-ai-agent-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform</a>. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-nonstop-ai-agent-worker-bee\">A nonstop AI agent worker bee</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called “Frontier agents,” including one called “Kiro autonomous agent” that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-nova-models-and-services\">New Nova models and services</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is rolling out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-launches-new-nova-ai-models-and-a-service-that-gives-customers-more-control/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">four new AI models</a> within its Nova AI model family — three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS’s big pitch is flexibility and customization.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lyft-s-argument-for-ai-agents\">Lyft’s argument for AI agents</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/aws-and-lyft-bringing-agentic-ai-to-life-for-riders-and-drivers\">piped up during the event</a> to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-factory-for-the-private-data-center\">An AI Factory for the private data center</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced “AI Factories”</a> that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia’s tech and AWS’s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon’s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon’s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ojyZCM6qk?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Or as AWS puts it: Customers supply the power and the data center, and AWS plunks in the AI system, manages it, and can tie it into other AWS cloud services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea is to cater to companies and governments concerned with data sovereignty, or absolute control over their data so it can’t wind up in a competitor’s or foreign adversary’s hands. An on-prem AI Factory means not sending their data to a model maker and not even sharing the hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that product name sounds familiar, it should. That’s what Nvidia calls its hardware systems that are chock-full of tools needed to run AI, from its GPU chips to its networking tech. This AWS AI Factory is, in fact, a collaboration with Nvidia, <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/aws-partnership-expansion-reinvent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">both companies say</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this case, the AWS Factory will use a combination of AWS and Nvidia technology. Companies that deploy these systems can opt for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs or Amazon’s new Trainium3 chip. It uses AWS’ homegrown networking, storage, databases, and security and can tap into Amazon Bedrock — the AI model selection and management service, and AWS SageMaker AI, the model building and training tool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, AWS is far from the only giant cloud provider installing Nvidia AI Factories. In October, Microsoft showed off its first of many-to-come <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/while-openai-races-to-build-ai-data-centers-nadella-reminds-us-that-microsoft-already-has-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Factories rolling out into its global data centers</a> to run OpenAI workloads. Microsoft didn’t announce at the time that these extreme machines would be available for private clouds. Instead, Microsoft highlighted how it was leaning on a host of Nvidia AI Factory data center tech to build and connect its new “AI Superfactories,” aka new <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-microsoft-ai-superfactories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">state-of-the-art data centers being built in Wisconsin and Georgia.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/06/16/announcing-comprehensive-sovereign-solutions-empowering-european-organizations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Microsoft also outlined the data centers and cloud services</a> that would be built in local countries to address the data sovereignty issue. To be fair, its options also include “Azure Local,” Microsoft’s own managed hardware that could be installed on customer sites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, it is a bit ironic that AI is causing the biggest cloud providers to invest so heavily in corporate private data centers and hybrid clouds like it’s 2009 all over again.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During its 12 years as a private business, the one-time tech darling raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/21/eventbrite-is-reportedly-going-public-in-the-second-half-of-this-year/\">approximately $330 million</a> in venture capital from top investors such as Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike traditional private equity firms, Bending Spoons buys companies that it intends to hold forever, aiming to turn them profitable by cutting costs, raising prices, and introducing new product features. In October, Bending Spoons announced a massive $270 million funding round that valued the company at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/what-is-bending-spoons-everything-to-know-about-aols-acquirer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$11 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides Bending Spoons, other investors follow the strategy of acquiring, fixing, and holding stalled software firms, often referred to as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/why-hold-forever-investors-are-snapping-up-venture-capital-zombies/\">“venture zombie”</a> companies. These firms include Constellation Software, <a href=\"https://www.curiousholdings.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Curious</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/ZLRLCzq8n8Hwl0OycKsOC9mENB?domain=tiny.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tiny</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/P_YLCKAo6ofMgjZYckS6C5Qqog?domain=saas.group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SaaS.group</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/sFSTCA8LmLhlyvGPsQtyCGW8vh?domain=arisingventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Arising Ventures</a>, and <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/qTZzCB1MnMHRQgzks1u9C2N0yT?domain=calmcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Calm Capital</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, told TechCrunch that the firm buys “great companies” at low prices and quickly revives them to achieve <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/why-hold-forever-investors-are-snapping-up-venture-capital-zombies/\">20% to 30% profit margins</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Audited annual revenue was flat at about $325 million for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. Bending Spoons has agreed to pay approximately 1.7 times Eventbrite’s trailing 12 months’ revenue of $295 million. Despite this seemingly low revenue multiple, Eventbrite stockholders will receive $4.50 in cash per share, an 81% premium over the previous day’s $2.48 closing price.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

That means that users who are provided with the now common AI-generated snapshot of key information on a topic or question above their search results can choose to go deeper by asking follow-up questions in a conversational interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google calls this conversational feature <a href=\"https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Mode</a>. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-ai-mode-rolls-out-to-us-will-add-support-for-deeper-research-comparison-shopping-and-more/\">launched to U.S. users this May</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/googles-ai-mode-expands-globally-adds-new-agentic-features/\">to global users this August,</a> allowing for back-and-forth chats with Google’s Gemini AI, in an experience similar to ChatGPT.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more. You may have thought you were starting a simple query, only to find yourself delving deeper into the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new test, announced on Monday, Google says users will be able to “seamlessly go deeper” in AI Mode directly from the Search results page. While the test is rolling out to users globally, it’s only available on mobile devices for the time being. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rollout comes alongside a push inside Google’s AI rival, OpenAI, which is now delaying other products to focus on improving the chatbox experience. Thanks in part to the release of Gemini’s Nano Banana image model and other Gemini improvements, Gemini has grown <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to over 650 million monthly users</a> as of November. Merging the conversational mode with AI Overviews, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\">has 2 billion monthly users</a>, could give Gemini an edge in consumer adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notes VP of Product for Google Search Robby Stein, <a href=\"https://x.com/rmstein/status/1995572911093289055\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a post on X</a>, “You shouldn’t have to think about where or how to ask your question.” Instead, he explained, users will continue to get an AI Overview as a helpful starting point, but will then be able to ask conversational follow-up questions in AI Mode from the same screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This brings us closer to our vision for Search: just ask whatever’s on your mind – no matter how long or complex – and find exactly what you need,” Stein wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ojyZCM6qk?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon Web Services on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-ai-frontier-agents-autonomous-kiro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> three new AI agents it calls “frontier agents,” including one designed to learn how you like to work and then operate on its own for days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each of these agents handle different tasks such as writing code, security processes like code reviews, and automating DevOps tasks such <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/cloudflare-blames-massive-internet-outage-on-latent-bug/\">as preventing incidents</a> when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called “Kiro autonomous agent” can work on its own for days at a time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kiro is a software coding agent based on AWS’s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced in July.</a> While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company’s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called “spec-driven development.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,” AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says Kiro maintains “persistent context across sessions.” In other words, it doesn’t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do.  It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garman described a task like updating a bit of critical code used by 15 bits of corporate software. Instead of assigning and verifying each update, Kiro can be assigned to fix all 15 in one prompt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To complete the automation of coding tasks, the cloud provider developed AWS Security Agent, an agent that works independently to identify security problems as code is written, tests it after the fact, and then offers suggested fixes. The DevOps Agent rounds out the trio, automatically testing the new code for performance issues, or compatibility with other software, hardware, or cloud settings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be sure, Amazon’s agents aren’t the first to claim long work windows. For instance OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-codex-max/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said last month </a>that GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, its agentic coding model, is designed for long runs, too, up to 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also not totally clear that the biggest hurdle to agentic adoption is the context window (aka the ability to work continuously without stalling out). LLMs still have hallucination and accuracy issues that turn developers into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">“babysitters,” they say.</a>  So developers often want to assign short tasks and verify quickly before moving on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, before agents can become like co-workers, context windows must grow bigger. Amazon’s tech is another big step in that direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ojyZCM6qk?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: Every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but also exceedingly important in this moment. There is also growing competition <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/what-is-substrate-a-thiel-backed-chip-startup-seeking-to-crack-asml-s-dominance?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">chasing after the same prize</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mina-fahmi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mina Fahmi</a>, who’s made a ring that captures your whispered thoughts and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">turns them into text</a>. Before you roll your eyes, know that he and co-founder Kirak Hong spent years at Meta working on this stuff after their company was acquired. The Stream Ring isn’t trying to be your friend — it’s trying to extend your brain. Backed by Toni Schneider, an operator who scaled WordPress in its earlier days, Sandbar just emerged from stealth and might well be onto something. (Schneider is a partner at True Ventures, whose other hardware bets have included Peloton, Ring, and Fitbit; he’s also coming to Palo Alto next week.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sciencecorporation_bringing-sight-to-the-blind-with-neural-engineering-activity-7292950930352726016-YI6a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Max Hodak</a> — Science Corp. founder, Time magazine <a href=\"https://time.com/7308925/elon-musk-memphis-ai-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cover subject</a>, and, earlier, Neuralink co-founder (along with Elon Musk) — who has already restored vision to dozens of blind people with retinal implants. Now he’s working on “biohybrid” brain-computer interfaces where chips seeded with stem cells grow into your brain tissue so paralyzed people can control devices with their thoughts. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, as Hodak views it. In fact, he thinks 2035 is going to look wildly different from today, and he’s happy to share how.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, we’re thrilled to welcome <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chchien\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chi-Hua Chien</a> of Goodwater Capital and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethweil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elizabeth Weil</a> of Scribble Ventures, two VCs who’ve backed Twitter, Spotify, TikTok, Slack, SpaceX, Figma, and Coinbase before they were household names.

Before his trip, Johnson and his Blueprint co-founder, Kate Tolo, joked they could make this stream like the Super Bowl and sell commercials. What was once a rite of passage for a certain ilk of college kids — listening to music and getting too high — was being turned into a very public, yet remarkably uncool, experiment on stretching the bounds of humanity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over a million people viewed the livestream on X, either in real time or as a replay. As Johnson ingested the shrooms and used his own technology from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/bryan-johnson-invests-100-million-in-kernel-to-unlock-the-power-of-the-human-brain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kernel</a> — a giant black helmet — to monitor his body’s reaction, a cadre of commentators with a collective net worth upward of $10 billion joined the video feed to heap praise upon Johnson for bravely tripping balls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some people see Johnson’s methods as elaborate, vampiric performance art, his Silicon Valley contemporaries think he’s a visionary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marc Benioff, founder and CEO of Salesforce, spoke about the parallels he sees between Johnson and the biblical Jacob.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My Bible study this morning was on Jacob’s Ladder … Jacob ends up with this incredible experience where he’s able to talk to God, and he’s climbing the ladder and coming back down, and finding the land he was in as holy,” Benioff said on the stream. “We’re still trying to find those bridges, and I think that’s what Bryan’s trying to do … He’s not doing this for recreational purposes, I would say.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071942\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png 3446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=1280,722 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=1536,867 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=1094,617 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Byran Johnson's livestream on X</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Naval Ravikant, the renowned investor and founder of AngelList, described Johnson as a “one-man FDA,” complaining that scientific advancement does not move forward as quickly as he would like due to regulators and bioethicists. It’s reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">manifesto</a> Marc Andreessen published two years ago, in which he decries “social responsibility” and “tech ethics” as enemies to innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Bryan’s] just like screw it, I’ll do it myself, and I’ll legitimize it, I’ll popularize it, I’ll experiment with it, and I’m gonna blaze the trail,” Ravikant said. “I hope he survives for a long time and then gives us the cheat codes. That’s really what we want. There should be a thousand Bryans, ten thousand Bryans out there doing this.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Johnson was not privy to this lavish praise — he had put on an eye mask and swaddled himself in a weighted blanket, oblivious to the proceedings of the five-hour livestream he had planned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it was a bit of a burden to have a microphone and have to be concentrating on what he wanted to say on a livestream,” explained Ashlee Vance, a journalist who has been chronicling Johnson’s pursuit to conquer death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The purpose of Johnson’s public, meticulously measured shrooms trip is to research the potential for the use of psychedelics in life extension — research that academics are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">already working on</a> in peer-reviewed studies. He’s far from the first to approach hallucinogens as a therapeutic intervention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the 1960s, Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary helped accelerate the movement to adopt psychedelics as mind-expanding tools, even sharing an interest in the same themes that captivate today’s tech elite: space migration, intelligence increase, and life extension, which Leary abbreviated as “SMI²LE.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Leary’s era, psychedelics were the focal point of a broader cultural movement that emphasized expanding the mind for the sake of music and art — he had a personal relationship with artists and writers like Allen Ginsberg, Ken Kesey, and the Grateful Dead (then called the Warlocks). <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/11/nyregion/ken-kesey-author-of-cuckoo-s-nest-who-defined-the-psychedelic-era-dies-at-66.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kesey,</a> who has said he volunteered to participate in experiments involving LSD and other psychedelic drugs, was a key influencer of the psychedelic era, whose exploits were documented in Tom Wolfe’s “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.” Even John Lennon first wrote “Come Together” as a campaign song for Leary’s political aspirations, but Leary never did run for office — instead, the song served as the opener for “Abbey Road,” one of the most iconic albums of the decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two generations later, Johnson is gearing up to take shrooms on a livestream as he tries to explain a concept he calls “longevity escape velocity,” the point at which humans would no longer have to age.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Time passes, but you stay the same age biologically,” Johnson said. “So that would be probably the most significant accomplishment for humans.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AKA, we’re going to try to make Bryan Johnson immortal, effectively, by 2039,” explained Tolo, who sat with Johnson through the duration of the stream.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So we’re basically doing this protocol and sharing it with all of you, for free, of how can we all do this together?” Johnson said. “So psilocybin is part of that journey where we’re trying to say, what therapies in the world could actually help us slow down our speed of aging, and reverse aging damage?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Johnson and Tolo portray this shrooms trip as a groundbreaking moment in the quest for immortality. The backdrop isn’t a dimly lit and smoke-filled room festooned with psychedelic colors and music, nor is it a university research lab. Instead, it could be another corporate Zoom meeting with the addition of Johnson wrapped in a weighted blanket and eye mask, happily divorced from responsibility. Looking fondly at Johnson in his cozy cocoon, Benioff remarked, “I think we’re missing a really great opportunity for a sponsorship with a sleep mask company.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071940\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png 3450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=1280,722 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=1094,617 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Byran Johnson's livestream on X</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, Johnson is roused from his swaddle, and Tolo struggles to collect his requisite saliva samples, then places a large black helmet on his head, which records his brain activity while he stares at a wall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Welcome to Johnson’s longevity revolution, which plays out in a beige room with beige furniture, equipped with laptops and tools for monitoring his biometrics, while some of the richest and most powerful in tech watch along.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A new “Notification organizer” will automatically group and silence lower-priority notifications, such as promotions, news, and social alerts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The update also brings more ways to customize devices, with users getting access to custom icon shapes, themed icons, and the option to automatically darken light apps, even those that don’t have their own native dark theme.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, there’s a new Parental Controls option within Android Settings that allows parents to set screen time limits, create downtime schedules, control app usage, and more for their children.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071853\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png 2128w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=768,586 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=680,519 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=1200,916 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=1280,977 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=430,328 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=720,549 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=900,687 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=800,611 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=1536,1172 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=2048,1563 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=668,510 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=491,375 491w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=808,617 808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=696,531 696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These updates are starting to roll out with Android 16 on eligible Pixel devices starting Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also releasing several new Android features that aren’t specific to Android 16. A new beta feature called “Call Reason” allows users to flag calls to saved contacts as “urgent.” Recipients will see this on their incoming call screen and know it’s time-sensitive. If they miss the call, the “urgent” note will stay in their call history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also launching “Expressive Captions” that display the full emotion of speech with tags like [sad] or [joyful], whether it’s a video message or a post on social media. The company says this will allow users to glean the full context of what’s being said when the sound is off.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant is making it easier to spot and exit unwanted group chats. If an unknown number invites a user to a group, they’ll get an alert that shows key information about the group. The user can then quickly choose to reply, leave the chat, or block and report the number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Pinned tabs in Chrome now work the same way as on desktop, which means pinned pages stay saved at the front of the browser, letting users pick up where they left off.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071855\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also updating Circle to Search, its feature that allows users to search from anywhere on their phone by using gestures like circling, highlighting, scribbling, or tapping. Users can now analyze suspicious messages with the feature — after initiating Circle to Search, an AI Overview will appear indicating whether the message is likely a scam.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For accessibility updates, Google is enhancing its “Guided Frame” feature in the Pixel camera app. Previously, the feature has notified users about things like a face in the frame. Now, it will provide a more in-depth description, such as “one girl with a yellow T-shirt sits on the sofa and looks at the dog.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, users no longer need to physically tap their phone to start using Voice Access, which allows users to control their Android devices with voice commands. Now, users just need to say “Hey Google, start Voice Access” to begin controlling their phone hands-free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also launching Fast Pair for hearing aids, starting with hearing aids from Demant, a Danish company that owns several major hearing aid brands, including Oticon, Sonic, and Bernafon.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s important to note that the game does not feature a multiplayer mode and players must be connected to the internet to play; offline gameplay is not available.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Originally released by Rockstar Games in 2010, Red Dead Redemption is set in the year 1911 during the Wild West era. Players assume the role of John Marston, a former outlaw searching for his kidnapped family. The mobile version includes the stand-alone expansion pack, “Undead Nightmare,” which follows Marston as he faces a zombie outbreak.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxzVIKskNOY?si=uY3wrU8V7oUN1k7Q\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The inclusion of Red Dead Redemption in Netflix’s gaming lineup is a significant addition to its gaming strategy, especially considering that Netflix has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/08/netflix-mobile-games-report-apptopia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">faced challenges</a> in previous years with fewer than 1% of its subscriber base engaging with the available games. The company’s investment in the space finally showed signs of growth in 2024, when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/netflix-games-gain-traction-with-installs-up-180-year-over-year-in-2023-thanks-to-gta-and-others/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">estimates</a> revealed that Netflix Games downloads increased 180% year-over-year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Red Dead Redemption is one of Rockstar’s most popular franchises, second only to the iconic Grand Theft Auto series. The game has attracted a dedicated base, and some players have been speculating that a prequel might be announced soon. The newly launched mobile game could potentially generate renewed interest in the franchise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch comes on the heels of Netflix’s introduction of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/netflix-is-letting-users-play-games-on-their-tv-screens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">games on smart TVs</a> in October.

This year, Amazon’s share of ChatGPT referrals grew to 54%, up from 40.5% in 2024. Walmart’s share, meanwhile, increased from 2.7% last year to now 14.9%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The data was collected by Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which is based on observed consumer activity on mobile devices. As it’s not first-party data, its figures are only estimates. For this analysis, the firm defined a referral session as a retail mobile app session that directly followed (within 30 seconds) a ChatGPT session.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the big jump from 2024, consumers’ use of AI chatbots to find e-commerce deals is still a small sliver of the overall referral market, Apptopia noted. Last year, ChatGPT’s referrals to e-commerce apps were only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday, and that figure only grew to 0.82% this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this case, a referral session was anytime ChatGPT either gave the searcher a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from their chat session that brought them to the retail app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apptopia isn’t the only firm digging into how AI is impacting e-commerce during the busy holiday shopping season. Adobe also reported this week that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday, and those who landed on a retail site from an AI chatbot were 38% more likely to make a purchase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Adobe said that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites on Cyber Monday increased by 670%. In the holiday shopping season so far (November 1 to December 1), AI traffic is up 760%, it noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NE-3tFhvf9c?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flags</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The cloud provider launched Nova 2, a fleet of four new AI models to its Nova model family, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s AWS re:Invent keynote on Tuesday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first version of AWS Nova was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/amazon-announces-nova-a-new-family-of-multimodal-ai-models/\">announced last year</a> at the company’s annual tech conference. At the time, the company released four text-generating models and one image-generating model. This year, AWS is giving the models an upgrade and launching an accompanying service.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The momentum has been really fantastic,” Garman said during his Tuesday keynote. “Nova has been, has grown to be used by tens of thousands of customers today, everyone from marketing giants to tech leaders like Infosys or Blue Origin or Robinhood to innovative startups like NinjaTech AI and today, we’re making Nova even better.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The four new models include Nova 2 Lite, a more cost-effective reasoning model. Reasoning AI models “think” before they respond and can process text, images, and videos to generate text that’s meant for everyday tasks. Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning agent that can process text, images, videos and speech that is designed for “highly complex tasks” like coding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nova 2 Sonic is a new speech-to-speech model to be used for conversational AI. Nova 2 Omni is a multimodal reasoning and generation model that can process images, text, video and speech input, and produce both text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the model upgrades, AWS also announced a new service called Nova Forge which allows AWS cloud customers to build their own frontier version of AWS Nova models called Novellas for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/02/amazon-nova-forge-lets-clients-customize-ai-models-for-100000-a-year.html\">$100,000 a year</a>, according to CNBC reporting. This service allows enterprises to access pre-trained, mid-trained or post-trained models for companies to then train on their own proprietary data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garman said this will be able to solve some of the problems that arise when enterprises try to incorporate their own data into already-trained AI models.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The more you customize models, the more you add a bunch of data in post training, these models tend to forget some of that interesting stuff that it learned earlier the core reasoning,” Garman said. “It’s a little bit like humans trying to learn new language. When you start when you’re really young, it’s actually relatively easy to pick up, but when you try to, you learn a new language later in life, it’s actually much, much harder. Model training is kind of like this too.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies including Reddit, Sony and Booking.com are early Nova Forge customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\">annual enterprise tech event here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ojyZCM6qk?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

OpenAI, however, clarified that the app suggestion was not an advertisement, but instead a poor attempt to integrate an app discovery feature within conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1995357492713570735\">a post on X</a>, which has since been viewed nearly 462,000 times, AI startup Hyperbolic’s co-founder, Yuchen Jin, shared a screenshot where ChatGPT seemingly suggested connecting the Peloton app in an unrelated conversation. Worse still, Jin noted he was a paid subscriber to ChatGPT’s $200 per month Pro Plan. At that price point, ads would not be expected.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The post, which was <a href=\"https://x.com/_dmca/status/1995572734617939973?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reshared</a> and saved hundreds of times across X, received quite a bit of attention, as it seemed to indicate OpenAI was testing the insertion of ads into its paid product. Users complained that paying customers, especially, shouldn’t have to see app suggestions like this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/dgrreen/status/1995594572488233020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">One person also pointed out</a> that they couldn’t get ChatGPT to stop recommending Spotify to them, even though they were an Apple Music subscriber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s data lead for ChatGPT, Daniel McAuley, <a href=\"https://x.com/_dmca/status/1995572734617939973?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">later jumped into the thread</a> to clarify that the Peloton placement was not an ad; it was “only a suggestion to install Peloton’s app.” He said there was “no financial component” to the appearance of the app suggestion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he admitted that “the lack of relevancy” to the conversation made it a bad and confusing experience, and OpenAI was iterating on the suggestions and the user experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A company spokesperson also confirmed to TechCrunch that what users had spotted was one of the ways OpenAI had been “testing surfacing apps in ChatGPT conversations.” They pointed to <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI’s announcement in October</a> about its new app platform, where the company noted that apps would “fit naturally” into user conversations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can discover [apps] when ChatGPT suggests one at the right time, or by calling them by name. Apps respond to natural language and include interactive interfaces you can use right in the chat,” the post explained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that didn’t appear to be the case here, as the user claims they weren’t discussing anything related to health and fitness. Instead, as the screenshot shows, they had been chatting with the AI about a podcast featuring Elon Musk, where xAI was the topic being discussed. Inserting Peloton into this experience was unhelpful and a distraction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet even if the app suggestion had been relevant, users may have still viewed it as an ad, given that it’s directing people to a product from a business that isn’t free. In addition, users can’t turn off these app suggestions, which may make them feel more intrusive.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This user sentiment could have potential ramifications for OpenAI’s desire to replace the App Store experience, and apps that run on your phone, with integrated apps that run within ChatGPT. If users don’t want to see app suggestions, they could choose to switch to a competitor’s chatbot to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, ChatGPT apps are available to logged-in users outside of the EU, Switzerland, and the U.K., and the integrations are still in pilot testing. OpenAI partners with a number of app makers, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Zillow, and others. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Users can also create wishlists for game items and send in-game items as gifts through direct messages.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Discord becomes a public company, it will face financial scrutiny, so these additions also present a new monetization opportunity for both Discord and game developers. By enabling developers to sell digital goods directly on Discord, the platform helps them reach a wider audience beyond their own communities, potentially boosting revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The initial rollout of these features is in partnership with the popular video game Marvel Rivals, which now has a dedicated store page within the game’s official Discord server. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071767\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DiscordMarvelRivals-Shop.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Discord</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marvel Rivals is a smart choice for this launch, as it garnered 10 million players within 72 hours of its release last year, generated over $100 million in its first month, and has built a community of more than 4 million members on Discord.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Players can now browse and purchase in-game items directly from the Marvel Rivals server, which includes items such as bundles, costumes, emotes, and emojis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, users can create wishlists that friends can view and purchase as gifts. With the holiday season approaching, this feature is particularly timely, as it simplifies gift-giving for those looking to buy for gamer friends or family members.
