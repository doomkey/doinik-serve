While the talks appear to be in the early stage, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, it could eventually lead to at least one company folding into SpaceX. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two scenarios are being hashed out. In one, SpaceX and Tesla would merge, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/elon-musk-s-spacex-is-said-to-consider-merger-with-tesla-or-xai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per Bloomberg</a>, citing unnamed insiders. In another, SpaceX and aXI (which already owns Musk’s social media platform X) would combine.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/musks-spacex-merger-talks-with-xai-ahead-planned-ipo-source-says-2026-01-29/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting by Reuters</a>, a merger between SpaceX and xAI could take place ahead of a planned SpaceX IPO this year. This would bring products like the Grok chatbot, X platform, Starlink satellites, and SpaceX rockets together under one corporation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Company representatives from SpaceX and xAI have not discussed this possibility in public. However, recent filings show that two new corporate entities were established in Nevada on January 21, which are called K2 Merger Sub Inc. and K2 Merger Sub 2 LLC. This suggests that Musk is keeping all options open.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are upsides to either scenario. Combining the SpaceX and xAI companies could allow xAI to put its data centers in space, something Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/elon-musk-says-teslas-restarted-dojo3-will-be-for-space-based-ai-compute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has said he wants</a>. A SpaceX-Tesla tie-up could align the EV maker’s energy storage business with the data center in space idea as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And both options — as well as a combination of all three companies — fall in line with Musk’s comments and recent actions to consolidate, or at the very least share resources between them. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, according to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/spacex-to-invest-2-billion-into-elon-musks-xai-413934de?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfJGajOyX0Jq6Oe7VY0pK_28EASB6Z_rVltqiEVHf09KirGkrAZ_vM4QJ2Y2Wg%3D&amp;gaa_ts=697bb6fc&amp;gaa_sig=jPWtwCwRQSOTId470Pop-Ss6xvPoSE8nKjZBP9e90_NelhVjLVNVL-Gb750oF1cEMhyx1EPYIM3SW7d621zGEg%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, and earlier this week, Tesla (also led by Musk) revealed it, too, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-invested-2b-in-elon-musks-xai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invested $2 billion</a> in the AI startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, xAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bought X</a> in a deal that Musk said valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. SpaceX, which has been around since 2002, reportedly launched a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/spacex-reportedly-in-talks-for-secondary-sale-at-800b-valuation-which-would-make-it-americas-most-valuable-private-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">secondary sale</a> that valued it at $800 billion, making it the most valuable private company in the U.S.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A recent Financial Times report indicated that Musk wants to take SpaceX <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ee356cb-5c77-4686-9392-260520369122\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">public in June</a>.

Such a funding round could lead the company’s valuation to shoot up to a titanic $830 billion. The Wall Street Journal is now <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-50-billion-in-openai-43191ba0?mod=tech_lead_story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting</a> that Amazon may contribute at least $50 billion of that record-breaking investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not much is known about the potential deal, although the Journal notes that Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, is currently leading the negotiations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. TechCrunch reached out to Amazon and OpenAI for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its pursuit of additional funding, OpenAI has also reportedly been having discussions with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East, and The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has written</a> that the startup has held additional talks with Nvidia, Microsoft, and SoftBank.

Medium CEO Tony Stubblebine is giving the company’s employees permission to take the day off to participate in tomorrow’s <a href=\"https://nationalshutdown.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nationwide general strike</a> protesting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activists behind the general strike are <a href=\"https://nationalshutdown.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">calling</a> for “no work, no school, and no shopping” amid a push to defund ICE, which has escalated raids in U.S. cities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/28/deaths-ice-2026-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">killing several people</a>, including two U.S. citizens earlier this month in Minneapolis.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a Slack message <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@the_coach_life/post/DUG2aMtERX5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared</a> today with Medium staff, Stubblebine says all employees are free to participate in the strike however they see fit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Whether or not you want to fully take the day away from work, or do a partial work day, or orient your work towards something that feels aligned to the goals of the strike, that is up to you,” he wrote in a general announcements channel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec clarified that Medium is not “in the business of dictating people’s politics,” so the choice to participate was an individual one, not a company mandate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, the publishing platform has an important role in helping people share news, opinions, insights, and analysis around politics, culture, and other topics. So that it can allow its employees to take the day off to protest, Stubblebine said Medium will coordinate with the necessary teams to ensure there’s a plan for “business continuity” on Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech leaders, including Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">outspoken in protest of ICE</a>.

Some execs — including <a href=\"https://spyglass.org/tim-cook-captured/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apple CEO Tim Cook</a> — were criticized for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/business/alex-pretti-melania-trump-corporate-ceos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">attending the screening</a> of the Amazon MGM Studios-produced “Melania” documentary on the day federal border control agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many rank-and-file tech employees, meanwhile, have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\">demanded that ICE and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) get out of U.S. cities</a>, as evidenced <a href=\"https://iceout.tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">by the open letter signed by</a> more than 500 tech industry employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stubblebine seems to share that opinion, writing that Medium has a responsibility to “make its stance clear,” especially “as many other tech orgs are donating to the Trump campaign.” He also said that Medium’s product exists to help “elevate truth and diverse voices,” not hateful content or racism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His message also reiterated Medium’s support for DEI, the set of pro-diversity policies the Trump administration has attempted to dismantle through executive orders, the elimination of DEI positions in the federal workforce, curriculum removals, legal targeting, and more.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our business thrives when the country thrives, and so being out there representing is good for [our] mission,” Stubblebine said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company released some impressive processing-speed specs for Maia, saying it outperforms <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/\">Amazon’s latest Trainium</a> chips and Google’s latest Tensor Processing Units (TPU).  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of the cloud giants are turning to their own AI chip designs in part because of the difficulty, and expense, of obtaining the latest and greatest from Nvidia — a supply crunch that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/20/nvda-stock-earnings-ai-bubble-china.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shows no signs of abating.</a>  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even with its own state-of-the-art, high-performance chip in hand, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company will still be buying chips made by others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a great partnership with Nvidia, with AMD. They are innovating. We are innovating,” he explained. “I think a lot of folks just talk about who’s ahead. Just remember, you have to be ahead for all time to come.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added: “Because we can vertically integrate doesn’t mean we just only vertically integrate,” meaning building its own systems from top to bottom, without using wares from other vendors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Maia 200 will be used by Microsoft’s own so-called Superintelligence team, the AI specialists building the software giant’s own frontier models. That’s according to <a href=\"https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2015825111769841744\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mustafa Suleyman</a>, the former Google DeepMind co-founder who now leads the team.

That earlier breach of SonicWall allowed hackers to obtain credentials needed to launch a ransomware attack against Marquis, the memo said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis said its third-party investigation determined that the hackers obtained information about its firewall during the breach at SonicWall, which Marquis claims was used to circumvent its firewall. Marquis confirmed in the communication that it stored a backup of its firewall configuration file in SonicWall’s cloud. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company was “evaluating its options” regarding its firewall provider, including the “recoupment of any expenses spent by Marquis and its customers in responding to the data incident,” according to the memo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, Hanna Grimm, an agency spokesperson representing Marquis, did not address or dispute the company’s recent communication to customers but reiterated the claim linking its breach with an earlier theft of its firewall configuration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In September 2025, after the data security incident affected our systems, our firewall service provider, an industry-leading cybersecurity company, publicly disclosed that a threat actor had earlier in the year gained unauthorized access to its cloud backup service,” the statement said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Marquis had recently begun using this provider’s firewalls to help protect our network,” the statement added. “While the provider initially reported that fewer than 5% of customers were affected, it later clarified in October 2025 that firewall configuration data and credentials associated with all customers using the cloud backup service, including Marquis, had been accessed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When contacted by TechCrunch, SonicWall spokesperson Bret Fitzgerald said that the company has asked Marquis for evidence to substantiate its claims and said it would continue to engage with its customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have no new evidence to establish a connection between the SonicWall security incident reported in September 2025 and ongoing global ransomware attacks on firewalls and other edge devices,” Fitzgerald said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Texas-based Marquis, which allows hundreds of banks and credit unions to visualize their customers’ data, began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/fintech-firm-marquis-alerts-dozens-of-us-banks-and-credit-unions-of-a-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">notifying hundreds of thousands of people last month</a> that their information was taken during its ransomware attack.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has access to large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the U.S., including personal information, financial data, and Social Security numbers, which the hackers stole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SonicWall <a href=\"https://www.sonicwall.com/support/notices/mysonicwall-cloud-backup-file-incident/kA1VN0000000RoD0AU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">conceded in October</a> that an earlier breach of its systems had in fact affected all of its customers who backed up their firewall files to SonicWall’s cloud. It had previously said hackers <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/sonicwall_breach_hits_every_cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stole only a fraction of its customers’ firewall configuration files</a> containing policies and settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the communication seen by TechCrunch, Marquis said it called in a third party to investigate whether a patch it had failed to roll out at the time of the breach could have been to blame but concluded that the patch related to a flaw was not exploitable in a way that could have allowed hackers to access the company’s data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis’ spokesperson declined to provide a number of how many individuals are affected by its data breach. The number of individuals known to be affected by the breach is expected to rise as new data breach notifications are submitted to state attorneys general. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Do you know more about the Marquis data breach?

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says the answer to that question is yes  — and spent considerable time on the earnings call trying to make that point.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft has spent almost as much on capital expenditures in the first half of its current fiscal year as it did in all of the previous year. And the numbers truly are enormous: Microsoft <a href=\"https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/Document/DownloadDocument/132/FinancialStatementFY26Q2.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spent</a> $88.2 billion on capital expenditures last year and has spent $72.4 billion so far this year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of that spend is to serve AI to enterprises and major AI labs, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/microsoft-earnings-7-6-billion-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">especially OpenAI</a>, as well as Anthropic. The big question on investors’ minds is: Will the spending turn into more use and ultimately profits?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors are scared that Microsoft’s main enterprise cloud product, Azure, and its Microsoft 365 apps didn’t grow as fast as they wanted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fact that BOTH Azure and the M365 segments fell a bit short is the key negative we’re hearing,” Wall Street analyst for UBS, Karl Keirstead, wrote in his research note on Thursday. (Keirstead isn’t worried about it, though, and recommends buying the stock.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-has-a-problem-nobody-wants-to-buy-or-use-its-shoddy-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">news reports circulated</a> that people didn’t really want to use Microsoft’s AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/microsoft-copilot-everything-you-need-to-know-about-microsofts-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">despite Copilot being weaved into all kinds of Microsoft products</a>.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nadella spent much of his time during the earnings call engaged in what is best described as AI use PR. Despite his pitch, some of the numbers he gave were pretty squishy.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Nadella said daily users of its consumer Copilot AI products had grown “nearly 3x year-over-year.” This refers to AI chats, the news feed, search, browsing, shopping, and “integrations into the operating system.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As to how many actual users that represents, he didn’t say. (We’ve reached out to Microsoft and asked.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, in <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its annual report</a>, the company said it surpassed 100 million monthly active Copilot users, but that counted both commercial users and consumers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He was more up front with Microsoft’s coding AI, GitHub Copilot, saying it now has 4.7 million paid subscribers, up 75% year-over-year. That appears to be a healthy business. Last year, in its annual report, Microsoft said that GitHub Copilot had 20 million users, a figure that includes those opting for the free tier.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also said Microsoft 365 Copilot now has 15 million paid seats from companies buying it for their employees. This is out of a base of 450 million paid seats, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Nadella called out the growth of <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/health-solutions/clinical-workflow/dragon-copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dragon Copilot</a>, Microsoft’s healthcare AI agent for medical professionals (a competitor to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/legal-ai-startup-harvey-confirms-8b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">superhot startup Harvey</a>). He said this product is available to 100,000 medical providers and was used to document 21 million patient encounters over the quarter, up threefold year-over-year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Will the billions spent on data centers be worth it? Nadella obviously thinks so. He and CFO Amy Hood said on the earnings call that demand for AI services across products far outstrips data center supply, so all of the new equipment is essentially booked to capacity for its lifespan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With its latest acquisition of the AI startup Q.ai, Apple aims to gain an edge, particularly in the audio sector.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​As first reported by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-acquires-audio-ai-startup-qai-2026-01-29/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reuters</a>, Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup specializing in imaging and machine learning, particularly technologies that enable devices to interpret whispered speech and enhance audio in noisy environments. Apple has been adding new AI features to its AirPods, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/airpods-pro-3-arrive-with-heart-rate-sensing-and-live-translation-using-apple-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">live translation capability</a> introduced last year. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also developed technology that detects subtle facial muscle activity, which could help the tech giant enhance the Vision Pro headset.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49f4e2e4-3a68-4842-be67-879409d06aa1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Financial Times</a> reported that the deal is valued at nearly $2 billion, making it Apple’s second-largest acquisition to date, after buying <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats-electronics-for-3b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Beats Electronics</a> for $3 billion in 2014. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Notably, this is the second time CEO Aviad Maizels has sold a company to Apple. In 2013, he <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/24/apple-primesense-acquisition-confirmed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sold PrimeSense</a>, a 3D-sensing company that played a key role in Apple’s transition from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition on iPhones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Q.ai launched in 2022 and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Gradient Ventures, and others. ​Its founding team, including Maizels and co-founders Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya, will join Apple as part of the acquisition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes a few hours ahead of Apple’s first quarterly earnings, in which <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-set-post-largest-revenue-121734611.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">analysts</a> are estimating revenue at around $138 billion.

The Alphabet-owned company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/waymo-rides-at-sfo\">said in a blog post Thursday</a> it will begin offering access to SFO to a select number of riders before offering it to all customers in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pickups and drop-offs will occur at the SFO Rental Car Center, which is accessible via AirTrain. Waymo said it plans to serve additional airport locations in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s SFO win comes as the company faces criticism and concerns about safety in some of the cities it operates. Waymo revealed Thursday that one of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-robotaxi-hits-a-child-near-an-elementary-school-in-santa-monica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">robotaxis struck a child</a> near an elementary school in Santa Monica. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating the January 23 incident, in which the child sustained minor injuries. Waymo is also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">being investigated</a> by the NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board over the illegal behavior of its robotaxis around school buses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Access to airports, and particularly SFO, is critical to Waymo’s business model, which hinges on geographic scale and a high volume of riders. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Serving rides to and from San Francisco International Airport delivers one of the most requested features for our riders and further deepens our relationship with the city,” Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has accelerated its plans over the past year, launching into new cities, increasing its fleet size, and adding freeways to where it operates. Waymo robotaxis now service most of the San Francisco Bay Area and down into Silicon Valley, where it has access to the San Jose Airport. It also operates in parts of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, and most of Phoenix, including curbside service to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/27/waymo-expands-its-curbside-robotaxi-service-to-phoenix-airport/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s push to operate at SFO has taken years.

Waymo then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/18/waymo-wants-to-bring-robotaxis-to-sfo-emails-show/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rebooted negotiations</a> with the city and airport authority and was granted a permit in March 2025 that would allow it to map SFO with some data-sharing strings attached, according to language in the agreement viewed by TechCrunch at the time.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By September, SFO and Waymo signed a testing and operations pilot permit, pushing the company closer to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/waymo-approved-to-start-testing-autonomous-vehicles-at-san-francisco-international-airport/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">commercial operations</a> at the airport.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Many AI leaders, including those at DeepMind, believe world models are a crucial step to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). But in the nearer term, labs like DeepMind envision a go-to-market plan that starts with video games and other forms of entertainment and branches out into training embodied agents (aka robots) in simulation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepMind’s release of Project Genie comes as the world model race is beginning to heat up. Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs late last year released its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\">first commercial product called Marble</a>. Runway, the AI video-generation startup, has also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/\">launched a world model recently</a>. And former Meta chief scientist <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/whos-behind-ami-labs-yann-lecuns-world-model-startup/\">Yann LeCun’s startup AMI Labs</a> will also focus on developing world models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it’s exciting to be in a place where we can have more people access it and give us feedback,” Shlomi Fruchter, a research director at DeepMind, told TechCrunch via video interview, smiling ear-to-ear in clear excitement over Project Genie’s release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepMind researchers that TechCrunch spoke to were upfront about the tool’s experimental nature. It can be inconsistent, sometimes impressively generating playable worlds, other times producing baffling results that miss the mark. Here’s how it works.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genie-marshmallow-castle.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087858\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A claymation-style castle in the sky made of marshmallows and candy</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You start with a “world sketch” by providing text prompts for both the environment and a main character, whom you will later be able to maneuver through the world in either first- or third-person view. Nano Banana Pro creates an image based on the prompts that you can, in theory, modify before Genie uses the image as a jumping off point for an interactive world. The modifications mostly worked, but the model occasionally stumbled and would give you purple hair when you asked for green.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also use real-life photos as a baseline for the model to build a world on, which, again, was hit or miss. (More on that later.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once you’re satisfied with the image, it takes a few seconds for Project Genie to create an explorable world. You can also remix existing worlds into new interpretations by building on top of their prompts, or explore curated worlds in the gallery or via the randomizer tool for inspiration. You can then download videos of the world you just explored. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepMind is only granting 60 seconds of world generation and navigation at the moment, in part due to the budget and compute constraints. Because Genie 3 is <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/autoregressive-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an auto-regressive model</a>, it takes a lot of dedicated compute — which puts a tight ceiling on how much DeepMind is able to provide to users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reason we limit it to 60 seconds is because we wanted to bring it to more users,” Fruchter said. “Basically when you’re using it, there’s a chip somewhere that’s only yours and it’s being dedicated to your session.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that extending it beyond 60 seconds would diminish the incremental value of the testing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The environments are interesting, but at some point, because of their level of interaction the dynamism of the environment is somewhat limited. Still, we see that as a limitation we hope to improve on.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-whimsy-works-realism-doesn-t\"><strong>Whimsy works, realism doesn’t</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087845\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png 3382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=768,411 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=680,364 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=1200,642 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=1280,685 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=430,230 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=720,385 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=900,482 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=800,428 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=1536,822 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=2048,1096 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=668,358 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=1153,617 1153w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=708,379 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Google received a cease-and-desist from Disney last year, so it wouldn’t build models that were Disney-related</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I used the model, the safety guardrails were already up and running. I couldn’t generate anything resembling nudity, nor could I generate worlds that even remotely sniffed of Disney or other copyrighted material. (In December, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-hits-google-with-cease-and-desist-claiming-massive-copyright-infringement/\">Disney hit Google with a cease-and-desist</a>, accusing the firm’s AI models of copyright infringement by training on Disney’s characters and IP and generating unauthorized content, among other things.) I couldn’t even get Genie to generate worlds of mermaids exploring underwater fantasy lands or ice queens in their wintery castles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the demo was deeply impressive. The first world I built was an attempt to live out a small childhood fantasy, in which I could explore a castle in the clouds made up of marshmallows with a chocolate sauce river and trees made of candy. (Yes, I was a chubby kid.) I asked the model to do it in claymation style, and it delivered a whimsical world that childhood me would have eaten up; the castle’s pastel-and-white colored spires and turrets looking puffy and tasty enough to rip off a chunk and dunk into the chocolate moat. (Video above.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Genie6467bd1e8f644c099a541385ac4f78c3-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087851\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A “Game of Thrones” inspired world that failed to generate as photo-realistically as I wanted</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Project Genie still has some kinks to work out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models excelled at creating worlds based on artistic prompts, like using watercolors, anime style, or classic cartoon aesthetics. But it tended to fail when it came to photorealistic or cinematic worlds, often coming out looking like a video game rather than real people in a real setting. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also didn’t always respond well when given real photos to work with. When I gave it a photo of my office and asked it to create a world based on the photo exactly as it was, it gave me a world that had some of the same furnishings of my office — a wooden desk, plants, a grey couch — laid out differently. And it looked sterile, digital, not lifelike. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I fed it a photo of my desk with a stuffed toy, Project Genie animated the toy navigating the space, and even had other objects occasionally react as it moved past them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That interactivity is something DeepMind is working on improving. There were several occasions when my characters walked right through walls or other solid objects. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Genie-bingo-bronson.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087841\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">I asked Project Genie to animate a stuffed toy (Bingo Bronson) so it could explore my desk</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When DeepMind released Genie 3 initially, researchers highlighted how the model’s auto-regressive architecture meant that it could remember what it had generated, so I wanted to test that by returning to parts of the environment it generated already to see if it would be the same. For the most part, the model succeeded. In one case, I generated a cat exploring yet another desk, and only once when I turned back to the right side of the desk did the model generate a second mug.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The part I found most frustrating was the way you navigated the space using the arrows to look around, the spacebar to jump or ascend, and the W-A-S-D keys to move. I’m not a gamer, so this didn’t come naturally to me, but the keys were often non-responsive, or they sent you in the wrong direction. Trying to walk from one side of the room to a doorway on the other side often became a chaotic zigzagging exercise, like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fruchter assured me that his team was aware of these shortcomings, reminding me again that Project Genie is an experimental prototype. In the future, he said, the team hopes to enhance the realism and improve interaction capabilities, including giving users more control over actions and environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t think about [Project Genie] as an end-to-end product that people can go back to everyday, but we think there is already a glimpse of something that’s interesting and unique and can’t be done in another way,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s concerning because the holidays are typically a boon for mobile apps, as people are gifted new smartphones and often have time off from work, allowing them to install new apps and games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decline continued in January 2026, with installs falling 45% month-over-month, to reach 1.2 million. Consumer spending has dropped as well, down 32% month-over-month as of January, Appfigures said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like an AI-flavored TikTok, Sora allows users to create AI videos using prompts. A unique feature allows users to cast themselves and their friends as main characters in the videos, if they choose, while shared videos can be remixed by others who can customize them further. The videos can also include music, sound effects, and dialogue to complete the scenes users create.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, Sora’s app has seen 9.6 million downloads across iOS and Android, and $1.4 million in consumer spending to date.

It currently sits at No. 101. Its highest rank is No. 7 in the Photo &amp; Video category. On Google Play in the U.S., the app fares worse, as it’s No. 181 overall among the top free apps.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These figures are still too high to write off the app as “dead,” but they are worrying. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decline is likely due to a number of factors working in tandem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For starters, Google’s Gemini, and particularly its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/google-releases-nano-banana-pro-its-latest-image-generation-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nano Banana model</a>, has proven to be fierce competition, helping its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/gemini-tops-the-app-store-thanks-to-new-ai-image-model-nano-banana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gemini AI app gain popularity</a>. Sora also competes with Meta AI, whose app launched an AI-powered Vibes video, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/meta-ais-app-downloads-and-daily-users-spiked-after-launch-of-vibes-ai-video-feed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">boosting its October downloads</a>, just as Sora was taking off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, OpenAI has struggled with containing copyright infringement in Sora. Initially, the company told Hollywood studios and agencies they would have to opt out of having their IP used in Sora, which naturally saw studio <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/07/openais-sora-2-must-stop-allowing-copyright-infringement-mpa-says.html#:~:text=OpenAI's%20Sora%202%20must%20stop%20allowing%20copyright,%22more%20granular%20control%22%20over%20their%20intellectual%20property.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">backlash</a>. But without robust copyright controls, users had been able to create AI videos using popular characters, like SpongeBob and Pikachu, which drove adoption. To appease Hollywood and stave off legal threats, Sora <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/04/sam-altman-says-sora-will-add-granular-opt-in-copyright-controls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">moved from an opt-out to an opt-in model</a> and increased restrictions in the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, the doors opened up a bit more as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-signs-deal-with-openai-to-allow-sora-to-generate-ai-videos-featuring-its-characters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI announced a deal with Disney</a>, which allowed users to generate videos in Sora with its characters. But so far, that news hasn’t increased Sora installs or consumer spending. (It’s also not necessarily a good look for Disney, considering <a href=\"https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/horrifying-sora-videos-disney-characters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some of the depraved videos</a> Sora users had made with its characters.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sora 2 was released to significant hype, with some calling it a <a href=\"https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/the-tiktok-of-ai-why-openais-sora-2-will-disrupt-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disruption</a> to social media and the TikTok of AI. But many users had no interest in letting others — even their friends — use their likeness to make AI videos. Without familiar faces and with limits on using commercial IP, people’s interest in Sora seems to have faded. Whether the app can stage a comeback with more copyright deals or new features remains to be seen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Anthropic</a> case, in which a group of fiction and nonfiction authors similarly accused the AI company of using their copyrighted works to train products like Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that case, Judge William Alsup ruled that it is legal for Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted content. However, he pointed out that it was not legal for Anthropic to acquire that content via piracy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bartz v. Anthropic case became a slap on the wrist worth $1.5 billion for Anthropic, with impacted writers receiving about $3,000 per work for roughly 500,000 copyrighted works. While $1.5 billion seems like a substantial sum, it’s not exactly back-breaking for a company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">valued</a> at $183 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Originally, these music publishers had filed a lawsuit against Anthropic over its use of about 500 copyrighted works. But through the discovery process in the Bartz case, the publishers say they found that Anthropic had also illegally downloaded thousands more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The publishers tried to amend their original lawsuit to address the piracy issue, but the court denied that motion back in October, ruling they’d failed to investigate the piracy claims earlier. That move prompted the publishers to instead file this separate lawsuit, which also names Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and co-founder Benjamin Mann as defendants.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While Anthropic misleadingly claims to be an AI ‘safety and research’ company, its record of illegal torrenting of copyrighted works makes clear that its multibillion-dollar business empire has in fact been built on piracy,” the lawsuit says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With <a href=\"https://www.mid-day.com/tech/tech-news/article/india-crosses-1-billion-internet-users-as-satellite-internet-drives-digital-growth-23595446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than a billion internet users</a>, the country now accounts for the highest global usage of Gemini for learning, according to Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, within an education system shaped by state-level curricula, strong government involvement, and uneven access to devices and connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Phillips was speaking on the sidelines of Google’s AI for Learning Forum in New Delhi this week, where he met with industry stakeholders, including K-12 school administrators and education officials, to gather feedback on how AI tools are being used in classrooms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scale of India’s education system helps explain why the country has become such a consequential testing ground. The country’s school education system serves about 247 million students across nearly 1.47 million schools, per the Indian government’s <a href=\"https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Economic Survey 2025-26</a>, supported by 10.1 million teachers. Its higher education system is among the world’s largest as well, with <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2097864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 43 million students</a> enrolled in 2021-22 — a 26.5% increase from 2014-15 — complicating efforts to introduce AI tools across systems that are vast, decentralized, and unevenly resourced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the clearest lessons for Google has been that AI in education cannot be rolled out as a single, centrally defined product. In India, where curriculum decisions sit at the state level and ministries play an active role, Phillips said Google has had to design its education AI so that schools and administrators — not the company — decide how and where it is used. That marks a shift for Google, which, like most Silicon Valley firms, has traditionally built products to scale globally rather than bending to the preferences of individual institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are not delivering a one-size-fits-all,” Phillips told TechCrunch. “It’s a very diverse environment around the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond governance, that diversity is also reshaping how Google thinks about AI-driven learning itself. The company is seeing faster adoption of multimodal learning in India, said Phillips, combining video, audio, and images alongside text — reflecting the need to reach students across different languages, learning styles, and levels of access, particularly in classrooms that are not built around text-heavy instruction.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-maintaining-the-teacher-student-relationship\">Maintaining the teacher-student relationship</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A related shift has been Google’s decision to design its AI for education around teachers, rather than students, as the primary point of control. The company has focused on tools that assist educators with planning, assessment, and classroom management, Phillips noted, rather than bypassing them with direct-to-student AI experiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The teacher-student relationship is critical,” he said. “We’re here to help that grow and flourish, not replace it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In parts of India, AI in education is being introduced in classrooms that have never had one device per student or reliable internet access. Google is encountering schools where devices are shared, connectivity is inconsistent, or learning jumps directly from pen and paper to AI tools, Phillips said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Access is universally critical, but how and when it happens is very different,” he added, pointing to environments where schools rely on shared or teacher-led devices rather than one-to-one access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Google is translating its early learnings from India into deployments, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/google-turns-gemini-toward-indias-most-competitive-entrance-exam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-powered JEE Main preparation</a> through Gemini, a nationwide teacher training program covering 40,000 Kendriya Vidyalaya educators, and partnerships with government institutions on vocational and higher education, including India’s first AI-enabled state university.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087519\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1200,666 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1280,711 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=430,239 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=720,400 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=900,500 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=800,444 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1536,853 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=668,371 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1111,617 1111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=708,393 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Gemini adds JEE Main preparation for Indian Engineering aspirants</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Google, India’s experience is serving as a preview of challenges likely to surface elsewhere as AI moves deeper into public education systems. The company expects issues around control, access, and localization — now obvious in India — to increasingly shape how AI in education scales globally.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-entertainment-to-learning-as-the-top-ai-use-case\">From entertainment to learning as the top AI use case</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s push also reflects a broader shift in how people are using GenAI. Entertainment had dominated AI use cases last year, said Phillips, who added that learning has now emerged as one of the most common ways people engage with the technology, particularly among younger users. As students increasingly turn to AI for studying, exam preparation, and skill-building, education has become a more immediate — and consequential — arena for Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s complex education system is also drawing increasing attention from Google’s rivals. OpenAI has begun building a local leadership presence focused on education, hiring <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/openai-announces-education-push-in-india-hires-second-india-employee/article69975697.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">former Coursera APAC managing director Raghav Gupta</a> as its India and APAC education head and <a href=\"https://openai.com/global-affairs/learning-accelerator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launching a Learning Accelerator program</a> last year. Microsoft, meanwhile, has <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/teachers-in-india-help-microsoft-research-design-ai-tool-for-creating-great-classroom-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded partnerships</a> with Indian institutions, government bodies, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/how-microsoft-planned-usd-3-billion-investment-in-india-is-playing-out-ai-upskilling-edtech-physics-wallah-ws-l-19615473.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">edtech players, including Physics Wallah</a>, to support AI-based learning and teacher training, highlighting how education is becoming a key battleground as AI companies seek to embed their tools into public systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, India’s latest Economic Survey flags risks to students from uncritical AI use, including over-reliance on automated tools and potential impacts on learning outcomes. Citing studies by MIT and Microsoft, the survey noted that “dependence on AI for creative work and writing tasks is contributing to cognitive atrophy and a deterioration of critical thinking capabilities.” This serves as a reminder that the race to enter classrooms is unfolding amid growing concerns over how AI shapes learning itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether Google’s India playbook becomes a model for AI in education elsewhere remains an open question. However, as GenAI moves deeper into public education systems, the pressures now visible in India are likely to surface in other countries as well, making the lessons Google is learning there difficult for the industry to ignore.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The founding team is impressive, and the goal — finding a less data-hungry way to train large models — is a particularly interesting one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on what I’ve seen so far, I would rate them as Level Two on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/a-new-test-for-ai-labs-are-you-even-trying-to-make-money/\">the trying-to-make-money scale</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there’s something even more exciting about the Flapping Airplanes project that I hadn’t been able to put my finger on until I read <a href=\"https://dcahn.substack.com/p/investing-in-flapping-airplanes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">this post from Sequoia partner David Cahn</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Cahn describes it, Flapping Airplanes is one of the first labs to move beyond scaling, the relentless buildout of data and compute that has defined most of the industry so far:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scaling paradigm argues for dedicating a huge amount of society’s resources, as much as the economy can muster, toward scaling up today’s LLMs, in the hopes that this will lead to AGI. The research paradigm argues that we are 2-3 research breakthroughs away from an “AGI” intelligence, and as a result, we should dedicate resources to long-running research, especially projects that may take 5-10 years to come to fruition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">[…]</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A compute-first approach would prioritize cluster scale above all else, and would heavily favor short-term wins (on the order of 1-2 years) over long-term bets (on the order of 5-10 years). A research-first approach would spread bets temporally, and should be willing to make lots of bets that have a low absolute probability of working, but that collectively expand the search space for what is possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It might be that the compute folks are right, and it’s pointless to focus on anything other than frenzied server buildouts. But with so many companies already pointed in that direction, it’s nice to see someone headed the other way.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Investors anticipated the decline in sales, but Tesla still beat Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates thanks to its energy storage business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla deployed a record 46.7 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in 2025, a 48% increase from last year, according to the company’s official filings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Big, stationary batteries like the Megapack and Powerwall, along with solar installations, now drive nearly a quarter of Tesla’s gross profit. Last quarter alone, the Megapack contributed $1.1 billion of the storage business’ $3.8 billion in gross profit for the entire year. Storage and energy generation revenues were up 26.5% to $12.8 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those batteries and solar panels are also very profitable, with a gross margin of 29.8%, nearly double what Tesla earns selling cars and trucks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Storage will likely play a larger role in the company’s near future, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large energy storage projects, like those installed for utilities or data centers, tend to be milestone-based, and revenue from the projects is recognized when certain milestones are achieved. In its 10-K filing with the SEC, Tesla said it expects to recognize $4.96 billion this year in deferred revenue from projects already underway. That’s more than double what the company recognized in deferred revenue from storage projects in 2025.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some hurdles lie ahead, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) phased out tax credits for residential energy storage systems like the Powerwall, though commercial tax credits for the Megapack and Megablock products will continue through the mid-2030s. Tariffs and provisions in the OBBBA also threaten to increase battery cell prices, the company said. Sales were up because volumes were up, but the average selling price of a Megapack was down, suggesting increased competition in the energy storage market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet overall, Tesla remains optimistic about the storage business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Despite these challenges, as AI infrastructure drives rapid load growth, we see opportunities for our energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity,” the company said in its earnings report.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The update comes a few months after Google Maps rolled out its Gemini-powered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/google-maps-bakes-in-gemini-to-improve-navigation-and-hands-free-use/\">hands-free, conversational driving experience</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement marks Google’s ongoing efforts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/google-previews-new-gemini-features-for-tv-at-ces-2026/\">plug Gemini into more</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/gmail-debuts-a-personalized-ai-inbox-ai-overviews-in-search-and-more/\">parts of people’s everyday lives</a>, while shifting Google Maps from static directions to real-time, conversational navigation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you’re walking around and navigating with Maps, you can now ask Gemini questions like “Tell me more about the neighborhood I’m in,” “What are some must-see attractions?” or “Are there cafes with a bathroom along my route?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says that walking and typing can be hard, which is why it’s rolling out the ability for users to ask questions without breaking their stride or leaving Maps’ navigation screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’re cycling, you can ask Gemini questions while remaining focused on the road, Google says. You can ask questions like “What’s my ETA?” or “When’s my next meeting?” Plus, you could ask Gemini to “Text Emily I’m 10 minutes behind” so you can communicate with others while keeping your grip on the handlebars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature lets you ask multiple questions in a conversation. For example, you could ask: “Is there a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route, something within a couple of miles? … What’s parking like there?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The update is now available worldwide on iOS wherever Gemini is available, and rolling out on Android.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as Google recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/google-maps-adds-gemini-powered-tips-section-ev-charger-availability-predictions-and-more/\">updated Maps</a> with new features, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tips sections that surfaces important information about places you’re interested in. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, reveal secret menu items, suggest the best place to park, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the navigation app also added an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature. The updated Explore tab makes it easier and faster to find trending spots near you, while the EV charger feature allows users to see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thursday’s announcement comes a day after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/chrome-takes-on-ai-browsers-with-tighter-gemini-integration-agentic-features-for-autonomous-tasks/\">Google updated Chrome</a> with enhanced Gemini integration and agentic features for autonomous tasks, as it looks to compete with AI browsers from companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Perplexity</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/opera-launches-its-ai-centric-neon-browser/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Opera</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Browser Company</a>.

Waymo told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the child — whose age and identity are not currently public — sustained minor injuries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NHTSA has opened an <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE26001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investigation</a> into the accident, and Waymo said in a <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/a-commitment-to-transparency-and-road-safety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> that it “will cooperate fully with them throughout the process.” The National Transportation Safety Board <a href=\"https://x.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/2016971702345892233\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said Thursday afternoon</a> that it has also opened an investigation in coordination with the Santa Monica Police Department.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said its robotaxi struck the child at six miles per hour, after braking “hard” from around 17 miles per hour. The young pedestrian “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle’s path,” the company said in its blog post. Waymo said its vehicle “immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo wrote in the post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News of the crash comes as Waymo faces dual investigations into its robotaxis illegally passing school buses. The NHTSA opened a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">probe</a> into the problem in October shortly after the first report of the incident in Atlanta, Georgia, and the NTSB opened its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investigation</a> last week after around 20 incidents were reported in Austin, Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the NHTSA, the accident occurred “within two blocks” of the elementary school “during normal school drop off hours.” The safety regulator said “there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation is investigating “whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.” The company did not release a specific analysis of this crash.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to include information about the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From the outside, Upwind Security looks like it’s had a smooth journey so far. Just four years in, the cloud security startup is now worth $1.5 billion and boasts the likes of Siemens, Peloton, Roku, Wix, Nextdoor, and Nubank among its clientele. But if you ask the company’s co-founder and CEO Amiram Shachar, the journey to get here was anything but certain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Three years ago, we would spend hours asking ourselves if we were heading in the right direction, and 80% of the time, it felt like we weren’t,” a candid Shachar told TechCrunch in an interview following the startup’s recent $250 million Series B. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the beginning, we constantly questioned whether the market needed our solution, whether it would be too hard to integrate into larger systems, or if customers would adopt it,” he recalled. “Developing a new approach was difficult; people are used to installing certain agents on machines, but they don’t like doing it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upwind likes to call that approach “runtime” security: Prioritizing alerts and remediation efforts around threats and vulnerabilities in active services in real time. As Shachar puts it, it’s an “inside-out” take on cloud security, where internal signals like network requests and API traffic function as context to help security teams separate urgent risks from those that can wait. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developing that approach wasn’t easy, however, as Shachar and his co-founders didn’t have a traditional background in security: They first built and sold a cloud compute brokerage called <a href=\"https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/06/04/netapp-spot-io-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Spot.io to NetApp</a> for around $450 million in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After joining NetApp post the Spot acquisition, I experienced firsthand how difficult cloud security really is,” Shachar said. “The security team would scan our environment and report issues, but they lacked critical context. Coming from a DevOps background, we [Shachar and his team] understood the infrastructure deeply, while security teams often didn’t know how APIs were exposed or which packages were running. As a result, they flagged many issues that weren’t real risks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Shachar and his team felt they had better insight into cloud environments because they were running them. “The dominant approach was agentless, an ‘outside-in’ model where you scan environments externally,” he explained. “It’s easy to deploy, but it creates a lot of noise because you can only see what’s visible from the outside.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team realized that the context provided by internal signals would be more useful to security teams, as they’d get to see what was happening in the network, in real time. But selling their new take on cloud security proved challenging, as security teams often lack permission to deploy software internally and default to more traditional tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So Upwind sales took time. “It wasn’t clear at first, and there was a lot of uncertainty; customers were hesitant,” Shachar said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But we saw something others didn’t,” he explained. “Inside-out isn’t an advanced option; it’s the only way to solve the next generation of problems. With ephemeral infrastructure like containers, serverless workloads, AI agents talking to each other, and data constantly moving through APIs, you simply can’t map this from the outside. It has to be inside.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the company had to contend with an overcrowded security market. Security teams were already overwhelmed by the number of tools, and customers didn’t want multiple products just to manage cloud security. “From the beginning, it was clear that Upwind would need to build a broad, integrated platform,” Shachar said. “Otherwise, customers wouldn’t engage or allow us to deploy our technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s logic eventually spoke to its target customers: large, data-intensive organizations with sizable cloud footprints. Since its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/confirmed-cloud-security-specialist-upwind-raises-100m-on-a-900m-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$100 million Series A in 2024</a>, Upwind has grown rapidly, posting 900% year-over-year revenue growth and doubling its customer base. The company has also expanded from its core markets in the U.S., U.K., and Israel to emerging markets, including Australia, India, Singapore, and Japan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $250 million Series B was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Salesforce Ventures and Picture Capital. The fresh cash will be used for product development and go-to-market motions, and the startup plans to invest in its AI security capabilities within its core cloud security platform and “extend its approach closer to developers to help prevent misconfigurations before they reach production.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
