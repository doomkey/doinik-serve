And it’s not just that I like numbers. These required filings cut through a lot of the marketing noise presented by companies the rest of the year. They also help me assess the short- and long-term stakes the companies face.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rivian</strong>’s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings did precisely that. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/rivian-was-saved-by-software-in-2025/\">My takeaway</a>: Software, and specifically its technology joint venture with Volkswagen Group, was the company’s savior in 2025. It will also buoy the company into 2026 (another $2 billion is expected from VW Group) as Rivian launches its most important product to date: the lower-cost R2 SUV. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s earnings also provided a progress report on its bid to lower the cost of goods sold per unit. The TL;DR is that the cogs per unit for its current portfolio is still high but dropping, meaning it’s losing less on each vehicle it sells. According to Rivian, the company’s automotive cogs per unit delivered was $100,900 in 2025, down from $110,400 in 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upcoming R2, which is supposed to be considerably cheaper (both in production cost and price tag) than its flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV, will be the next big test. We’ll get some insight into the results of that later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The R2 is expected to go into production in the first half of the year (we’re hearing June), and based on its guidance for 2026, Rivian is confident it has the demand and the ability to ramp production. The company expects to deliver between 62,000 and 67,000 vehicles in 2026 — which could provide up to a 59% bump from last year. Rivian delivered 42,247 vehicles in 2025, which includes its two R1 consumer vehicles and the electric delivery van (EDV).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The market loved that guidance, btw. Rivian stock shot up 27% in the day after it reported earnings.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past 18 months, I’ve noticed a divergence in how <strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> are approaching AVs. Uber is locking up AV partnerships with every player it can. Lyft is trailing behind. Turns out, I am not alone in this observation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Insiders have shared their puzzlement about why Lyft hasn’t been more aggressive on this front. They noted that Lyft is sitting on about $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, and recently announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program that represents about 15% of its market cap, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/02/13/ai-firms-like-openai-seek-nvidia-alternatives.html\">per CNBC</a>. That has some wondering why Lyft did not invest in parts of the AV value chain like Uber is doing versus buying shares back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, these little birds also pointed to a few top executives who have departed over the past year. Aurélien Nolf left his position as VP of financial planning and analysis and investor relations to become CFO of Navan. Audrey Liu, who was an executive VP and head of rider and community safety, is now at Adobe. Ameena Gill, who was VP of safety and customer care just took a job at rival Uber.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

Many of the dominant and buzziest ones have since shuttered, while some of the smallest players have hung on and expanded. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Take <strong>Ouster</strong>, for instance. I remember way back when Ouster had this tiny little booth in the jam-packed startups area (Eureka Park) at CES. Today, the company is much bigger — thanks to scale, its 2022 merger with rival Velodyne, and its acquisition of Sense Photonics in 2021. And it doesn’t appear to be finished. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/lidar-maker-ouster-buys-vision-company-stereolabs-as-sensor-consolidation-continues/\">most recently acquired</a> <strong>Stereolabs</strong>, a company that makes vision-based perception systems for robotics and industrial applications, for a combination of $35 million and 1.8 million shares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TechCrunch senior reporter Sean O’Kane notes in his article, the deal is the latest in a march toward consolidation among perception sensor suppliers. (Just last month, MicroVision bought the lidar assets of the buzzy-but-now-bankrupt Luminar <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/luminar-sale-approved-despite-last-minute-mystery-bid/\">for $33 million</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So why all the activity? It’s complicated, as they say. From my POV, the frenzy around “physical AI” has reignited interest and investment in sensor technologies, particularly cameras.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ever</strong>, the EV-only marketplace, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/eclipse-backs-all-ev-marketplace-ever-in-31m-funding-round/\">raised $31 million</a> in a Series A funding round led by Eclipse. Other backers include Ibex Investors, Lifeline Ventures, and JIMCO — the investment arm of the Saudi Arabian Jameel family (an early investor in Rivian).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Natilus</strong>, the San Diego-based startup developing blended-wing aircraft, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://natilus.co/natilus-raises-28-million-series-a-to-commercialize-family-of-hyper-efficient-blended-wing-aircraft/\">raised $28 million</a> in a Series A funding round led by Draper Associates.

This seemingly minor design detail has life-or-death stakes and comes as the EV industry, and particularly <strong>Tesla</strong>, is getting pressure to change concealed, electronic door handles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/trump-administration-undermines-epa-enforcement-of-clean-air-act/\">officially repealed</a> the EPA’s 2009 “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260130073817/https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a\">endangerment finding</a>,” which found that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane were a threat to human health and welfare. This change would only affect tailpipe emissions for cars and trucks — if the EPA makes it through the lengthy process of repealing the law, which will certainly include numerous lawsuits aimed at stopping it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Uber</strong> has locked in a couple dozen AV partnerships, and we’re starting to see the results of those deals.

And that was why I started looking through these files, in part because a long time ago, flashback 10 years ago on my beat especially, there was just a ton of Chinese investment in the space. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was before even the rush of EV startups in China that we see today […] In autonomous vehicles, but electric vehicles especially, there was this moment where Chinese investors and Chinese companies, state-owned automakers, all they wanted to do was to be looked at like Silicon Valley startups. So they came here and they invested in companies and helped get them off the ground, or in some cases even set up offices in Silicon Valley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And it was in that environment that a lot of the companies that I’ve covered for a long time popped up. There was just never a full picture of how a lot of them were funded. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One in particular, this company called Canoo, which is now bankrupt and out of business, had maybe the most mysterious set of investors of all of them. They really were not upfront about it when they first sort of came out of stealth in early 2018. And it frankly took until there was a lawsuit between some people who ran the company near the top that the investors were revealed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, it was this businessman in China who was relatively close, the son-in-law of the former sort of like the fourth most senior CCP official under the previous leader of China and a giant electronics magnate from Taiwan. And then there was this really strange guy named David Stern, who was the third founding investor. And there was so little information about this guy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I could tell, back then, that he was some sort of German businessman, that he had some connections to China, but it wasn’t really clear how he had gotten involved. The only thing I really remember hearing at the time was that he was close with Prince Andrew, which I just thought was very strange, this idea that someone had even told me a long time ago, probably in 2018 or 2019, that Prince Andrew was involved with this company Canoo in some way, maybe not invested, but advising or something.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was something that stuck in my head for a very long time, clearly, because I went looking for that information as more of these files came out, assuming that proximity to Prince Andrew means proximity to someone like Epstein.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that was the case here, more so than I could have imagined, because this guy Stern turned from an enigma or a ghost into someone who was present through all this dealmaking 10 years ago, where we see him pitching, in the span of about a year and a half, investments in Faraday Future, trying to convince Epstein to maybe throw a couple hundred million dollars into that company, trying to buy the 30% stake that Faraday Future’s founder had bought or acquired in Lucid Motors arrival at the time, which I feel is an overlooked dynamic [in] how those companies grew around then — and then also in Canoo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epstein never invested in any of those companies despite that proximity, but it was just such a revealing thing. And I get into it in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/prince-andrew-advisor-pitched-jeffrey-epstein-on-investing-in-ev-startups-like-lucid-motors/\">the story that I wrote last week</a>, but we get this sweep of a decade of relationship that Stern had with Epstein from approaching him initially in 2008, kind of hat in hand, and introducing himself and saying, “Hey, I want to invest in China. Will you throw in some money?” to being someone who was seemingly very close to him by the end. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirsten:</strong> The whole thing is really interesting, and it goes back to my initial comments about how sometimes when you get a chance to look back at with new information at how deals were unfolding, it really just changes your perception and perspective of the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And for those who didn’t follow quote-unquote “mobility,” think of it as how we’re thinking about physical AI these days. Everyone was talking about it. Every automaker wanted to have a piece of quote-unquote “the future of transportation” or “mobility.” And so it makes a lot of sense that some of these more secretive types were also jumping in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sean, one of the points you made to me as I was working on the story with you, in terms of editing it, you were [saying], it was very clear that Epstein and David Stern weren’t really about investing and building companies. It was all about how to make the most money the fastest. And that, I think, is really historically important and interesting and gives you a little bit of an insight into — in addition to all the horrible, horrifying, terrible things he did to human beings, [Epstein] was a complete operator as well, in order to make money as quickly as possible. And you see that in these emails and exchanges between David Stern and Epstein.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Sean:</strong> Yeah, to both of those points really, I open the story with a moment in time where Lucid Motors […] they had been basically a battery supplier for a long time and then they pivoted into the passenger vehicle startup that we know them as today, but they were really struggling to raise their Series D at the time, and they really needed that money to start production of their first electric sedan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They were struggling, behind the scenes in large part because the founder of Arrival quietly amassed this major stake and was kind of pushing people away and making it look like an uninvestable company in some ways, but the hype around all of that at the time was creating opportunities for people like Stern and Epstein, and we see them talk in these emails about, you know, Stern comes to Epstein and basically says, “I heard that they’re raising. Can you get information from Morgan Stanley?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epstein turns around and passes that information back, and then you see this discussion about, okay, well, Morgan Stanley says Ford — which was reported at the time — had kind of an investment offer, potential acquisition offer, on the table for Lucid Motors [and] was going to come in in that Series D. And they’re chopping up — do we invest in this and maybe get a big return down the road? Or is it something that we sell as Ford comes in a couple months later, if we can get this stake now at fire sale prices?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, they didn’t go through with that, but Stern did eventually invest in Canoo and help get that company off the ground.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthony:</strong> One thing — maybe pulling back a little bit from the specific industries or investments — that’s also an important piece of context that generally gets mentioned in any of these stories about Epstein in Silicon Valley, but is worth repeating here, is that he [pleaded] guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Almost all the emails that we’re talking about with these stories [and] in pretty much any other story about Epstein in Silicon Valley comes after that. So it’s also partly a story about how people get comfortable with the idea that, okay, this guy has a pretty shady past already. He wasn’t the infamous criminal that he eventually [became], but there were things that were already known about him, and because he was a source of connections to power, to famous names, to money, a lot of people were just willing to look past that.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why top talent is walking away from OpenAI and xAI | Equity Podcast\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K3w3skyzZg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Without a doubt, one of the hottest new startup accelerators in tech right now is Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program. Launched in 2023, the accelerator has an acceptance rate of less than 1%. In a <a href=\"https://speedrun.substack.com/p/what-we-look-for-in-applications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">January blog post,</a> the program said that over 19,000 startups pitched and fewer than 0.4% were accepted into the latest cohort. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The program used to focus on gaming startups, then expanded into entertainment and media, and is now a “horizontal program,” Joshua Lu, the program’s general manager and a partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. Today, founders of any type of startup can apply, and the program runs for about 12 weeks in San Francisco. It once had a program in Los Angeles, but Lu said the focus will be on SF from now on. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are two cohorts a year, and around 50 to 70 startups are accepted into each. The program <a href=\"https://speedrun.a16z.com/the-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invests up to $1 million</a> into each company, though the downside is that it’s a bit pricey. It typically invests $500,000 up front in exchange for 10% of the startup’s company via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months, at whatever terms agreed to by the other investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, Y Combinator <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/deal\">typically takes a fixed 7% </a>of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 “invested on an uncapped MFN safe.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speedrun said its program is more “equity expensive” because of what it offers founders. It provides them with access to a16z’s advisory and business networks that assist with tasks like go-to-market, brand development, media strategy, and talent sourcing. Plus it offers the startups perks like $5 million in credits to vendors such as AWS, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Deel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the high interest, and low acceptance rate, TechCrunch spoke to Lu for some tips on how startups can best stand out. The latest cohort began in January and will end in April with a Demo Day. Applications for <a href=\"https://speedrun.a16z.com/apply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the next cohort open in April,</a> though it looks at off-season applications year-round, Lu said. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focus-on-the-founding-team-nbsp-nbsp\">Focus on the founding team  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speedrun focuses on early-stage startups. Because of this, they really examine who is on the founding team and whether their skills complement each other, Lu said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That doesn’t mean one has to be technical and one has to be commercial and one has to be marketing,” Lu said. It means that “we prefer not to see any glaring holes in capabilities or interests. We want the founding team to be self-aware and for that to be part of the hiring plan.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also like to see teams that have worked together before or have a shared history. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are lots of things that a founding team has to navigate in their startup journey and having a bit of pattern recognition, being able to work with each other, knowing how to disagree and how to come out the other side of a disagreement, those are all things people on founding teams with shared histories have an easier time with, on average,” he continued. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though AI has lowered the barriers to building software, it’s still incredibly helpful for a founding team to be technical, Lu said. At the same time, because AI has made it much faster to build and validate hypotheses and get a product out there, Lu said the Speedrun team likes to see when a startup already has a little bit of market validation or traction for their product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Speedrun as a program is really great at helping teams pour gasoline on a very small spark or fire,” he said. “We look for teams that have endeavored to build and try to show us that there’s a little spark we can fan the flames on.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-limit-the-market-theory\">Limit the market “theory”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu said one common mistake founders often make in the application process is spending too much energy talking about the market theory or why there is a defined problem and why their solution is the right one. “All of that may be true,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, he added, even the biggest, most successful tech companies faced unexpected blockades when they were young, sometimes even pivoting completely. What a company thinks it’s going to build at the beginning isn’t necessarily what will make it successful at the end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we really want to hear about is why this founding team is really good together,” he continued, “why they’re a great founding team, the best possible founding team to solve this particular problem.” And then on top of that, any validation on the idea itself. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-okay-to-use-ai-for-the-application-but\">It’s okay to use AI for the application, but…</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu said the program encourages every founder to use AI to “clean up” their application. He said there is now no excuse for grammar errors or misspellings given the rising sophistication of AI tools. He also said AI can help founders sort out their thoughts, making them clearer, more concise, and more coherent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if AI did all the work in explaining the startup, that may backfire. If a founder makes it to the next round, it will be a live video-call interview. “At that point, their live narration explanation skills are going to be put to the test,” he said. So founders should be prepared to talk cogently about their startup without the help of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Only about 10% of founders make it to the video-call stage. There are typically two to three investors on the judging panel at a time. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the live interview, the team typically conducts a few more screening calls with the founders, and then a final decision on the cohort is made. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-be-greedy-to-network\">Be greedy to network</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are, of course, other accelerator programs for startups to choose from. Lu said Speedrun itself was inspired by some of these other programs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, he said, this accelerator prides itself on giving founders access to a large, specialized operating team. In fact, he said the best teams that get the most out of the program are the ones most “greedy about getting exposure to the amazing people and programs” Speedrun has to offer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu listed off just a few points: a16z has around 600 people, and 10% of that staff is on the investment team, he said; everyone else is an operator who supports the companies the firm works with. As a result, founders in Speedrun will have access to experts who can help with marketing, banking, finance, management, and many other functions. So it helps to know who the startup wants to connect with and why. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We tell founders that come through the program, what you get out of Speedrun is what you put into it,” he said. “We think founders who want to take advantage of world experts in many different domains early in their startup journey would be really smart to choose us.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-advice-from-a-founder-in-the-program\">Advice from a founder in the program</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founder Mohamed Mohamed, who is in the recent cohort, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/proptech-startup-smart-bricks-raises-5-million-pre-seed-in-round-led-by-a16z/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">just announced a $5 million raise</a> for his proptech startup Smart Bricks led by a16z’s Speedrun. He was attracted to the program because he said it stood out as one of the few “explicitly designed for co-founders working on frontier AI applications,” and he picked it because he wanted a program that would allow him to “stress-test an ambitious technical vision.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mohamed said he treated the application like an internal strategy memo rather than a pitch. “Instead of polishing buzzwords, we focused on clarity — the real problem, why it’s structurally hard, and why our team is unusually well-positioned to solve it,” he said. “We were explicit about what was working, what wasn’t, and where we needed help. I think that honesty and clear articulation of why this problem matters” is what helped the company in the application process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He called the whole process “rigorous but refreshingly thoughtful,” and said it was designed to understand how founders think, not just what they have built so far. “The conversations went deep into product architecture, data strategy, and long-term ambition. It felt closer to a partner-level discussion than a typical accelerator interview, which was a strong signal for us,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His overall advice is to be “intellectually honest and precise.” For example, he said in his application he avoided “over-optimizing” for the sake of hyping up his company. “If you’re vague, derivative, or overly defensive about your idea, it shows quickly. Don’t try to sound bigger than you are; clarity about where you actually are is far more compelling than inflated narratives,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the end, “Speedrun isn’t looking for perfect companies; they’re looking for founders who can reason clearly about complex problems and build with conviction,” he said. “Articulate the hard parts of what you’re doing and why they’re worth tackling. Depth beats polish every time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction, story originally misstated YC’s investment for its 7%.

And like Sora, Seedance quickly drew criticism for an apparent lack of guardrails around the ability to create videos using the likeness of real people, as well as studios’ intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After one X user <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134\">posted a brief video</a> showing Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, which they said was created by “a 2 line prompt in seedance 2,” “Deadpool” screenwriter <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/RhettReese/status/2021446414337966098\">Rhett Reese responded</a>, “I hate to say it.

For the first time since the dot-com crash, computer science enrollment dropped. System-wide, it fell <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/college-admissions/article/uc-major-computer-science-ai-21284464.php\">6% last year</a> after declining 3% in 2024, according to reporting this past week by the San Francisco Chronicle. Even as overall college enrollment <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nscresearchcenter.org/final-fall-enrollment-trends/\">climbed 2% nationally</a> — according to January data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center — students are bailing on traditional CS degrees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The one exception is UC San Diego  — the only UC campus that added a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://today.ucsd.edu/story/uc-san-diegos-new-ai-major-is-here\">dedicated AI major this fall</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This all might look like a temporary blip tied to news about fewer CS grads <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/10/the-computer-science-dream-has-become-a-nightmare/\">finding work out of college</a>. But it’s more likely an indicator of the future, one that China is much more enthusiastically embracing. As MIT Technology Review <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/28/1120747/chinese-universities-ai-use/\">reported last July</a>, Chinese universities have leaned hard into AI literacy, treating AI not as a threat but instead as essential infrastructure. Nearly 60% of Chinese students and faculty now use AI tools multiple times daily, and schools like Zhejiang University have made AI coursework mandatory, while top institutions like Tsinghua have created entirely new interdisciplinary AI colleges. In China, fluency with AI isn’t optional anymore; it’s table stakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. universities are scrambling to catch up. Over the last two years, dozens have launched AI-specific programs. MIT’s “AI and decision-making” major is now the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://capd.mit.edu/blog/2025/12/04/mits-aid-major-becomes-one-of-the-institutes-most-popular-undergraduate-programs/\">second-largest major</a> on campus, says the school. As <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/01/technology/college-computer-science-ai-boom.html\">reported</a> by the New York Times in December, the University of South Florida enrolled more than <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://This%20semester,%20more%20than%203,000%20students%20enrolled%20in%20a%20new%20college%20of%20artificial%20intelligence%20and%20cybersecurity%20at%20the%20University%20of%20South%20Florida%20in%20Tampa\">3,000 students</a> in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://crowsneststpete.com/2025/09/29/usfs-bellini-college-launch-attracts-students-to-ai-and-cybersecurity-research/#:~:text=The%20college's%20goals%20include:%20*%20Improving%20the,college%20on%20the%20Tampa%20campus%20by%202028.\">new AI and cybersecurity college</a> during its fall semester. The University at Buffalo <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hesc.ny.gov/about/news-releases/governor-hochul-announces-first-their-kind-ai-specialized-degrees-offered\">last summer</a> launched a new “AI and Society” department that offers seven new, specialized undergraduate degree programs, and it received <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2025/12/University-at-Buffalo-solidifies-leadership-AI-data-science.html\">more than 200 applicants</a> before it swung open its doors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transition hasn’t been smooth everywhere. When I spoke with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/the-man-betting-everything-on-ai-and-bill-belichick/\">UNC Chapel Hill Chancellor Lee Roberts </a>in October, he described a spectrum — some faculty “leaning forward” with AI, others with “their heads in the sand.” Roberts, a former finance executive who arrived from outside academia, was pushing hard for AI integration despite faculty resistance. A week earlier, UNC had announced it would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.unc.edu/posts/2025/10/09/development-of-a-new-school-at-carolina/\">merge two schools</a> to create an AI-focused entity — a decision that drew faculty pushback. Roberts had also appointed a vice provost specifically for AI. “No one’s going to say to students after they graduate, ‘Do the best job you can, but if you use AI, you’ll be in trouble,’” Roberts told me. “Yet we have faculty members effectively saying that right now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parents are playing a role in this rocky transition, too. David Reynaldo, who runs the admissions consultancy College Zoom, told the Chronicle that parents who once pushed kids toward CS are now reflexively steering them toward other majors that seem more resistant to AI automation, including mechanical and electrical engineering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the enrollment numbers suggest students are voting with their feet. According to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cra.org/crn/2025/10/cerp-pulse-survey-a-snapshot-of-2025-undergraduate-computing-enrollment-patterns/\">survey</a> in October by the nonprofit Computing Research Association — its members include computer science and computer engineering departments from a wide range of universities — 62% of respondents reported that their computing programs saw undergraduate enrollment declines this fall. But with AI programs ballooning, it’s looking less like a tech exodus and more like a migration. The University of Southern California is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkj7qOeSte4#\">launching an AI degree</a> this coming fall; so are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/about/news/columbia-engineering-announces-new-program-master-science-artificial-intelligence#:~:text=The%20mix%20of%20backgrounds%20will,success%20in%20their%20chosen%20field.%E2%80%9D\">Columbia University</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pace.edu/news/press-release-pace-university-launch-bachelor-of-science-artificial-intelligence-fall-2026\">Pace University</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.nmsu.edu/news/nmsu-introduces-new-institute--degrees-in-artificial-intelligence/s/57adb5a5-de63-4659-8daa-fb7759372e5b\">New Mexico State University</a>, among many others.

But it’s certainly a wake-up call for administrators who’ve spent years wrestling with how to handle AI in the classroom. The debate over whether to ban ChatGPT is ancient history at this point.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of Silicon Valley has spent years chasing mega-rounds and buzzy AI deals. Meanwhile, Stacy Brown-Philpot is running Cherryrock Capital like a throwback to venture capital’s earlier days, writing smaller Series A and B checks to founders that larger firms routinely overlook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The former TaskRabbit CEO and decade-long Google veteran launched Cherryrock a year ago after seeing what she calls a persistent gap: access to capital for “underinvested entrepreneurs” building software companies at the crucial growth stage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I left TaskRabbit, I took some time off to figure out what was next and saw this gap in the market, which was access to capital, particularly for underinvested entrepreneurs,” Brown-Philpot told TechCrunch. She’d originally come to the Bay Area 25 years ago, planning to become a VC and even writing her Stanford Business School essay about it. After spending a decade at Google and leading TaskRabbit to a successful exit to IKEA, she’s finally back to that original plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She circled back to it for a reason. Before launching Cherryrock, Brown-Philpot was a member of the investment committee for the SoftBank Opportunity Fund, a $100 million vehicle started in 2020 to back underserved entrepreneurs. That experience proved there was no shortage of overlooked founders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SoftBank itself sold the Opportunity Fund to its leadership team in late 2023, divesting from the diversity-focused initiative. Brown-Philpot, meanwhile, doubled down, and launched her own fund. By the time she closed Cherryrock’s debut fund in February 2025, she already had more than 2,000 companies in her pipeline. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherryrock is targeting 12 to 15 investments from its first fund — a concentrated approach and stark contrast to the seed funds that make dozens of bets, or massive funds that write nine-figure checks. Brown-Philpot’s also taking her time; a year after announcing the fund, she and her team, including cofounder Saydeah Howard, who spent nine years at the venture firm IVP, have backed just five companies, putting them about a third of the way toward their goal. In an era when many funds race to deploy capital almost as quickly as it’s raised, Brown-Philpot’s measured pace is another throwback to an earlier generation of VCs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown-Philpot’s focus on “underinvested” founders — a careful choice of words in today’s political climate — means backing entrepreneurs who might not fit the typical Silicon Valley mold.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked directly about the current political environment, where DEI has become a lightning rod, Brown-Philpot is unfazed. “It doesn’t change the pitch at all,” she said. “When we look at the people who decided to back Cherryrock, like JPMorgan and Bank of America…these are financial institutions who expect to generate a return. Our job as investors is to do just that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to those investors, Cherryrock’s LP roster includes Goldman Sachs Asset Management, MassMutual, Top Tier Capital Partners, and Melinda Gates’s Pivotal Ventures. Some of these have stepped back from explicit diversity pledges amid pressure from the Trump administration. Yet Brown-Philpot may find herself in an unexpectedly advantageous position. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A new <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cooley.com/news/insight/2024/2024-12-03-californias-broad-venture-capital-diversity-reporting-law-amended-to-now-take-effect-in-2026\">diversity reporting law</a> in California requires VC firms with a California nexus to report demographic data on their portfolio companies’ founding teams, with the first deadline in April. Unlike some corporate diversity initiatives that have faced legal challenges, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.littler.com/news-analysis/asap/california-doubles-down-diversity-data-new-era-dei-transparency-venture-capital\">the law</a> focuses on transparency rather than mandates, requiring reporting but not quotas. For a firm like Cherryrock that’s already tracking and prioritizing investments in diverse founders, compliance is “table stakes,” as Brown-Philpot puts it. “You accomplish what you measure.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown-Philpot’s perspective is informed by her vantage point across multiple institutions. Beyond Cherryrock, she sits on the boards of HP, StockX, and Stanford University — roles that give her insight into both enterprise buyers and the next generation of founders. At Stanford, she’s watching students navigate questions about AI’s impact on employment. “What I see on campus is the students are charting a path and finding a way to create opportunities for themselves,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her portfolio reflects her thesis. One investment is Coactive AI, led by Cody Coleman, an MIT grad with advanced degrees in philosophy and engineering from MIT and Stanford. The company provides multimodal AI infrastructure to the media and entertainment industry, a sector now under intense scrutiny following controversies around AI-generated content. Cherryrock led Coactive’s Series B alongside Emerson Collective.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another bet is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pitch-deck-vitable-health-raise-16-million-2024-7\">Vitable Health</a>, founded by Joseph Kitonga, a Thiel Fellow and Y Combinator alum. The Philadelphia-based company provides on-demand, primary care-based health insurance to employers and hourly workers – the kind of population Brown-Philpot came to know well as the CEO of TaskRabbit during its last years as a standalone company. Kitonga “is the exact kind of founder that we want to back,” Brown-Philpot said. “He does what he says he’s going to do.” Brown-Philpot first invested at the seed stage of Vitable through her work with the SoftBank Opportunity Fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked about her operating philosophy, Brown-Philpot is pragmatic about exits. “It’s very difficult to go public,” she said. “Most companies don’t go public, they do get acquired.” It’s a refreshingly honest take in an industry that often overpromises on IPO prospects. She points to TaskRabbit’s sale to IKEA as proof that the right acquisition can create lasting value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for 2026, Brown-Philpot’s priority is simple: “We are actively deploying capital.” She’s looking for Series A and B companies that have achieved product-market fit at scale, letting founders define what that means. And while the broader venture ecosystem debates the future of diversity initiatives, she is focused on finding great founders, wherever they are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m from Detroit,” she says. “Hard things are hard, but we know how to do hard things.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a tech once seen only in movies, most notably in “Clueless,” where Cher styles and plans her outfits using computer technology. Alta is similar to that, allowing users to plan and style outfits using the latest AI innovations. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A slew of big names participated in Atla’s round last year, including models Jasmine Tookes and Karlie Kloss, Anthropic’s VC arm Anthology Fund, and Rent the Runway cofounder Jenny Fleiss. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch caught up with Wang during New York Fashion Week to talk about <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.altadaily.com/\">how the company</a> has expanded since that round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For starters, the product is officially in the app store; <em>Time</em> and <em>Vogue</em> named it one of the best innovations of last year, and Wang said more than 100 million outfits have been generated on the platform since its launch in 2023.  It has partnerships with Poshmark and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, with more partnerships to be announced soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Alta’s own app also features thousands of brands that users can shop from,” Wang said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, the company is focused on building app and website integration experiences for brands, she said, where customers can try on a designer’s clothing using a personalized Alta Avatar. This week, the company unveiled its first integration collaboration, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.publicschoolnewyork.com/\">teaming up with Public School</a>, a storied New York City brand. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Shoppers can style looks from the new collection on their own Alta avatar,” Wang said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She met the Public School team — Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne — through the founder of Poshmak, who is also an angel investor in both companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Public School designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne had been looking for an AI partner and virtual try-on avatar solution, and Dao-Yi has been an Alta app user himself,” Wang said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Public School actually went on hiatus for a few years, with this NYFW marking its grand re-debut. When asked, the founders of the brand said they rediscovered their voices and what they wanted to say. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have to look at tech as a partner in the business today,” Chow told TechCrunch, adding, “It’s not 2015 anymore,” so the team wants to take advantage of the latest technological developments. “We want to be thoughtful on how we use tech and AI,” he continued, “not as a design tool but as a tool to extend our storytelling and a tool to interact with the consumer and have them experience the brand even if they can’t do so in person.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3093157\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png 1502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=1200,801 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Alta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wang said this is one of the first instances of a designer embedding personal avatar and styling technology into its own website. Near the bottom of Public School’s product page, there is an icon that says <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.publicschoolnewyork.com/products/linden-jacket?variant=48139461656831\">Style by Alta</a>. Clicking that takes the customer to Alta for them to then style their avatars and test out how Public School clothing would look on them, should they purchase. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users on Alta’s standalone app can also access Public School through Alta’s app. Wang said the goal is for Alta to integrate more experiences like this into other brands and websites, so Alta users can try on clothes on other websites even while outside the Alta app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Right now, a user would have to add a potential purchase into their Alta wishlist, then style outfits and try on their avatar, versus being able to do that directly on the brand website.” (For every site but Public School, that is.) “The goal is to bring their community on a new journey to engage with and shop the brand.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many major fashion brands, like Zara and Balmain, have already experimented <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/declaneytan/2018/08/31/balmain-unveils-latest-campaign-starring-cast-of-digital-supermodels/\">with digital avatars</a>. Wang said what makes Alta different here, especially compared to Zara, is that Alta avatars can put on at least 8 items within seconds, whereas Zara avatars can wear only four and often take around two minutes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, demand for virtual avatars has increased. Wang considers Alta both still the “Cluless”  technology that it started out with, and a digital avatar business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The consumer Alta app is the ‘Clueless’ closet, while the enterprise Alta experience allows shoppers to style pieces and try the outfits on their pre-existing Alta avatar,” he said. Eventually, Wang said she wants Alta to be the “personal identity layer for the future of consumer AI and shopping.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For agentic commerce to truly work, she said, “We need a data layer that understands the shopper’s style preferences, such as their closet, past purchases, and their avatar, likeness, and body, which is Alta.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Barton teamed up with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fiduciaai.com/\">Fiducia AI </a>to create a multilingual AI agent (built with IBM watsonx on IBM Cloud) to help guests identify pieces of the collection and try them on virtually. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch caught up with Barton and Ganesh Harinath, the founder and CEO of Fiducia AI, before the show to learn more about the presentation. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one, Barton said technology is baked into how she thinks. She likes playing with the real and the unreal, and found the idea of using AI-like set design, “a portal into the collection’s world, rather than ‘AI for AI’s sake,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today, tech is a tool for expanding the world around the clothes, how they are presented, and how people enter the story, and how we create that moment when your eyes do a double-take,” she told TechCrunch, adding that the goal for this collection was to create a sense of curiosity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harinath said his company used IBM watsonx, IBM Cloud, and IBM Cloud Object Storage to help pull off Barton’s presentation. It was a production-grade activation with a Visual AI lens (built with IBM watsonx) that detects pieces from Barton’s new collection. It can answer questions in any language via voice and text and offers photorealistic virtual reality try-ons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The hardest work wasn’t model tuning; it was orchestration,” he told TechCrunch. This isn’t the first time Barton has put a technological spin on her fashion — last season, she <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-nyfw-ai/\">experimented with AI models</a>, also in collaboration with Fiduicia AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At fashion week, there was some chatter about whether brands — and, if so, which ones — would be using technology and artificial intelligence. Barton thinks many brands are using AI, though quietly, mainly in operations. “Maybe fewer are using it publicly because of the potential reputational risk,” she said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It rhymes a bit with the early days when many big fashion names were nervous about starting websites. “Then it became inevitable, and eventually the question shifted from ‘should we be online’ to ‘is our online presence any good?’” she said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3093162\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kate Barton</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harinath added that, though many brands are experimenting with AI, much of its deployment remains at the surface level — such as chatbots, content generation, and internal productivity tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Barton sees a world of better prototyping, better visualization, smarter production decisions, and more immersive ways to experience fashion, without replacing the humans who “actually make it worth wearing.” Change will only come with more clarity, she said, with “clear discourse, clear licensing, clear credit, and a shared understanding that human creativity is not an annoying overhead cost.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If the technology is used to erase people, I am not into it,” she said, adding that audiences are smarter than we think. “They can tell the difference between invention and avoidance.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the tension, AI is becoming more routine, and there will come a day when shows like Barton’s are just part of the norm. Harinath thinks AI in fashion will be normalized by 2028, and by 2030, he sees it becoming embedded into the operational core of retail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of this technology already exists — the differentiator now is assembling the right partners and building teams that can operationalize it responsibly,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dee Waddell, Global Head of Consumer, Travel and Transportation Industries at IBM Consulting, agreed. “When inspiration, product intelligence, and engagement are connected in real time, AI moves from being a feature to becoming a growth engine that drives measurable competitive advantage,” Waddell told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But until then, there is this show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The most exciting future for fashion is not automated fashion,” Barton said. “It is fashion that uses new tools to heighten craft, deepen storytelling, and bring more people into the experience, without flattening the people who make it.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A previous iteration of the program, launched in 2016, committed ₹100 billion to 145 private funds that have invested more than ₹255 billion (about $2.8 billion) in over 1,370 startups, according to official data <a href=\"http://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2227988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released</a> on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The program is structured as a fund of funds, a common venture capital model in which governments back startups indirectly by committing capital to private investment firms. It is designed to take a more targeted approach than its 2016 counterpart, focusing on deep-tech and manufacturing startups that typically require longer time horizons and larger amounts of capital, while also backing early-stage founders, expanding investment beyond major cities and strengthening India’s domestic venture capital industry, particularly smaller funds, per the Indian government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the announcement on Saturday, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw highlighted the scale of India’s startup expansion, pointing to figures shown on a presentation slide indicating the number of startups has grown from fewer than 500 in 2016 to more than 200,000 today. The slide said more than 49,000 startups were registered in 2025 alone, the highest annual total on record.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cabinet approval follows recent changes to India’s startup rules aimed at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/india-has-changed-its-startup-rules-for-deep-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">easing pressure on deep-tech companies</a>. New Delhi doubled the period for which such firms are classified as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion, or about $33 million, up from ₹1 billion previously.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The approval comes just ahead of the government-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">India AI Impact Summit</a>, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia are set to participate alongside Indian corporates such as Reliance Industries and Tata Group. India, the world’s most populous country and one of its largest internet markets with more than a billion online users, has become an increasingly attractive arena for global tech companies looking to expand their user base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, private capital has become harder to secure. India’s startup ecosystem <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/27/india-startup-funding-hits-11b-in-2025-as-investors-grow-more-selective/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $10.5 billion in 2025</a>, down just over 17% from a year earlier, even as investors grew more selective and sharply reduced the number of deals. The number of funding rounds fell nearly 39% to 1,518 transactions, according to data from Tracxn.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vaishnaw said the new venture capital program would remain flexible, adding that “extensive consultations have taken place with all stakeholders.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The store is located in Bengaluru, where the company says a large chunk of its user base is concentrated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new, two-story location will showcase Nothing’s products and other projects. Customers will also be able to buy hardware products and other merchandise from the store and have select items customized.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We wanted to create a fun space,” the company’s co-founder and CEO Carl Pei said. “It’s kind of inspired by all the parts that are related to the brand. For instance, the factory: if you buy a product, there’s like a production line where the product comes out. We also show machines where phones go through testing, like USB port testing or water resistance testing. So we just wanted to bring that world together.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The store will feature products from both Nothing and CMF, its budget brand, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/smartphone-maker-nothing-to-spin-off-its-affordable-cmf-brand/\">which it spun off last year</a>. Notably, CMF is headquartered in India and has a joint venture with local Indian ODM (original design manufacturer), Optiemus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pei mentioned that both brands are differentiated in terms of the products they offer, which fall into different price ranges, as well as the audiences they target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nothing is more niche with a higher price. CMF is more [targeted toward] mass [market]. You know it’s mass, but it’s not just off-the-shelf rebrand products that usually [appear] in this price point. They are also products that we put a lot of care into,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has been Nothing’s strongest market, with over 2% of the smartphone market share, the research firm IDC told TechCrunch last year. It also noted that Nothing was the fastest-growing brand in the country in Q2 2025, with 85% growth in shipments year-over-year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other hardware makers are building aspirational retail stores in India, too. For instance, Apple is set to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-to-open-its-sixth-store-in-borivali-on-february-26/articleshow/128290316.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">open its sixth store in the country this month</a>, situated in Borivali, a suburb of Mumbai.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the first Nothing store outside of London, where the company is headquartered. The startup said that it plans to open two more stores in Tokyo and New York, but didn’t provide timelines for the openings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/nothing-closes-200m-series-c-led-by-tiger-global-plans-ai-first-device-launch/\">$200 million in Series C funding at a $1.3 billion valuation last year, led by Tiger Global,</a> along with investors like GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF, and Tapestry.

Security researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaw after identifying insecure “super admin” application programming interfaces on DavaIndia’s website and privately shared details with Indian cybersecurity authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bug is now fixed, and Zveare <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://eaton-works.com/2026/02/13/dava-india-hack/\">disclosed his findings</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposure comes as Zota Healthcare rapidly scales DavaIndia Pharmacy’s retail business. The Gujarat-headquartered company operates more than 2,300 DavaIndia stores across India, including <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/capital-market-news/zota-health-care-gains-after-adding-276-davaindia-stores-in-q3-fy26-126010200369_1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">276 new outlets</a> announced in January, and plans to <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-in/lifestyle/pets-animals/zota-health-care-to-pump-rs-350-crore-into-dawa-india-plans-1-500-stores-in-two-years/ar-AA1SOVYR?apiversion=v2&amp;domshim=1&amp;noservercache=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">add another 1,200 to 1,500</a> over the next two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare told TechCrunch that the flaw stemmed from insecure admin interfaces, which allowed unauthenticated users to create “super admin” accounts with high privileges. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that level of access, an attacker could view thousands of online orders containing customer information, modify product listings and prices, create discount coupons, and change settings governing whether certain medicines required a prescription, the researcher said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on system timestamps, Zveare said the vulnerable administrative interfaces appeared to have been live since late 2024. The access exposed nearly 17,000 online orders and administrative controls spanning 883 stores, he said, allowing changes to product pricing, prescription requirements, and promotional discounts. Zveare said the access allowed edits to website content that could have been used for defacement or disruption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pharmacy order data can be particularly sensitive, as it may reveal information about a person’s health conditions, medications or other private purchases. Exposure of such data, even without evidence of misuse, carries heightened privacy and patient-safety risks compared with other consumer information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Customer information was linked to their orders,” said Zveare. “This includes name, phone numbers, email IDs, mailing addresses, total amount paid, and the products purchased. Since this is a pharmacy, the products being purchased could be considered private and even embarrassing for some people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare said he reported the issue to CERT-In, India’s national cyber emergency response agency, in August 2025. The vulnerability was fixed within weeks, though confirmation from the company took longer and was provided to the cyber authorities in late November, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sujit Paul, chief executive of Zota Healthcare, did not respond to emails sent by TechCrunch last month. The researcher said there was no indication the flaw had been exploited before it was patched.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It knows you. It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company separately said it is testing a new feature that lets users search and ask questions about properties and locations using natural language queries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Airbnb offers an LLM-powered customer service bot, for some personalization, and communications. The new AI search feature is expected to “evolve into a more comprehensive and intuitive search experience that extends through the trip.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Questioned by analyst whether Airbnb would roll out sponsored property slots within AI search, Chesky said the company wants to get the design and user experience right first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI search is live to a very small percentage of traffic right now. We are doing a lot of experimentation. Over time, we are gonna be experimenting with making AI search more conversational, integrating it into more than the trip, and, eventually, we will be looking at sponsor listings as a result of that,” Chesky said, adding that Airbnb would consider designing an ad unit that fits the conversational search flow.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chesky said Airbnb plans to tap the AI expertise of its new CTO, Ahmad Al-Dahle (he worked on Meta’s  Llama models previously), to use its trove of identity and review data to make the app more useful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb claimed its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/airbnb-is-quietly-rolling-out-an-ai-customer-service-bot-in-the-us/\">AI-powered customer support</a> bot, launched in North America last year, now handles a third of customer problems without needing any human intervention. Chesky noted there are plans to enable customers to call the AI bot for support, and expand language coverage to customer support as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A year from now, if we are successful, significantly more than 30% of tickets will be handled by a custom service agent, in many more languages, in all the languages where we have live agents. AI customer service will not only be chat, it will be voice,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also thinking about increasing AI usage internally.

If successful, the company believes that in a year’s time, more than 30% of its total customer support tickets will be handled by AI voice and chat in all the languages where it also employs a human customer service agent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think this is going to be massive because not only does this reduce the cost base of Airbnb customer service, but the quality of service is going to be a huge step change,” CEO Brian Chesky said during the company’s <a href=\"https://investors.airbnb.com/press-releases/news-details/2026/Airbnb-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fourth-quarter earnings</a> call this week. This seems to suggest he believes the AI would do a better job than its human counterparts in resolving some issues.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also touted its recent hire of CTO Ahmad Al-Dahle, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/12/airbnb-abnb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">poached from Meta</a> for his AI expertise, and its plans to create an AI-native experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With his guidance, Chesky said that Airbnb was poised to introduce an app that doesn’t just search for you, but one that “knows you.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” Chesky explained, adding that’s why Airbnb brought Al-Dahle on board. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ahmad is one of the world’s leading AI experts. He spent 16 years at Apple, and most recently led the generative AI team at Meta that built the Llama models. He’s an expert at pairing massive technical scale with world-class design, which is exactly how we’re going to transform the Airbnb experience,” Chesky noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other businesses poised for disruption by AI, Airbnb’s leadership is pushing the idea that it has a unique database and product that other AI chatbots can’t replicate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A chatbot doesn’t have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can’t message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do,” Chesky told analysts during the earnings call. Instead, he pitched the idea of layering AI over the Airbnb experience, which he claimed would help to accelerate growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company forecast revenue growth would be in the “low double digits” this year, after pulling in $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/q4-airbnb-abnb-earnings-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">above estimates </a>of $2.72 billion. This quarter, it expects revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $2.53 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors still wanted to know if AI platforms could be a risk in the long-term, assuming they moved into the short-term rentals market. Chesky, however, pushed back at that idea, saying that Airbnb isn’t just the consumer-facing app; it’s also the host app, the customer service, and the protections it offers, like insurance and user verifications.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve built this over 18 years. We handle more than $100 billion in payments through the platform,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, AI chatbots serve a function similar to search, in that they deliver top-of-funnel traffic, he noted. That traffic also converts at a higher rate than traffic from Google, Chesky pointed out, suggesting that the shift to AI would benefit Airbnb.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is already using AI to power its search, with the feature now enabled for a “very small percentage” of Airbnb’s traffic, while it experiments with making its search more conversational. Later, the company plans to integrate sponsored listings within search.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Spotify this week told investors its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/spotify-says-its-best-developers-havent-written-a-line-of-code-since-december-thanks-to-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best developers hadn’t written a single line of code</a> since December, thanks to AI, Airbnb offered a more high-level metric on its own internal AI adoption. The company said that 80% of its engineers now use AI tools, and it’s working to get that to 100% soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga did not respond to a request for comment and to provide more information, such as the total number of customers affected. The company says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#multi-factor-authentication\">multi-factor authentication</a>, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords. The company did not respond when it was asked if there was no multi-factor on the email account prior to this breach. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga was founded in 2005 in Japan, and is headquartered in Tokyo.

The SEC’s FOIA department said it had identified “approximately 21.7 gigabytes of electronically maintained records” related to the investigation. The agency doesn’t typically make records available if investigations are still open, and it explained in a follow-up email that it “was closed in September 2025.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how far the investigation progressed. The SEC <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/fisker-faces-sec-investigation-as-bankruptcy-case-drags-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revealed the existence of the probe</a> in an October 2024 filing in Fisker’s bankruptcy case. The agency wrote at the time that it had sent subpoenas to the company and that it may need to “request or subpoena additional documents in the future relating to its ongoing investigation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment. Founder and former CEO Henrik Fisker did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The closure of the Fisker investigation comes amid a significant drop in enforcement actions and settlements during President Trump’s second term. The SEC initiated 313 enforcement actions in 2025 — the lowest in a decade and down 27% from the the final year of President Biden’s term, according to <a href=\"https://www.paulweiss.com/media/mxhbfcx4/sec_enforcement_2025_year_in_review.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an analysis by law firm Paul, Weiss</a>. Only four of those enforcement actions were against public companies. Total monetary settlements fell 45% from 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fisker was one of the last remaining electric vehicle startups under investigation by the SEC. Over the last few years, the agency settled fraud or other charges brought against <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikola-agrees-83m-sec-settlement-213634419.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nikola</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/lordstown-motors-sec-charged-misleading-investors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lordstown Motors</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/30/ev-company-canoo-agrees-to-1-5m-settlement-with-sec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Canoo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-sec-settles-fraud-charges-against-hyzon-motors-over-misleading-investors-2023-09-26/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hyzon Motors</a>, and others.
