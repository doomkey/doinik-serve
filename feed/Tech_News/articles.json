            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three weeks ago, Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, revealed it raised $20 billion in a <a href=\"https://x.ai/news/series-e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Series E funding round</a>. Now we know Tesla is among its investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla disclosed in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">letter to shareholders</a> on Wednesday that it invested $2 billion in xAI, the startup behind the Grok chatbot that also owns <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Musk’s social media company X</a>. Other <a href=\"https://x.ai/news/series-e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously disclosed</a> investors in xAI include Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, as well as Nvidia and Cisco as “strategic investors.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a truly circular deal and one that Tesla shareholders voted against last year. In November, shareholders were asked in a nonbinding measure to allow the Tesla board to authorize an investment in xAI. About 1.06 billion votes were in favor, and 916.3 million opposed, per <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-07/tesla-shareholders-didn-t-approve-authorizing-investment-in-xai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg’s reporting</a> at the time. While that would seem like an approval, the number of abstentions — which count as votes against in Tesla’s bylaws — meant the measure was rejected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla proceeded anyway and offered up an argument in support of the investment. Tesla’s justification appears to be tied to xAI’s alignment with its most recent master plan — and how these companies are about to get a lot closer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As set forth in Master Plan Part IV, Tesla is building products and services that bring AI into the physical world. Meanwhile, xAI is developing leading digital AI products and services, such as its large language model (Grok),” the shareholder letter reads. “In that context, and as part of Tesla’s broader strategy under Master Plan Part IV, Tesla and xAI also entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla said the agreement builds upon an existing relationship with xAI by “providing a framework for evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.” Tesla already supplies its Megapack batteries to power xAI data centers, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1924684815548207566\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirmed last year</a>, and the company <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/support/grok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has included</a> the xAI chatbot Grok into some of its vehicles. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-09/musk-s-xai-reports-higher-quarterly-loss-plans-to-power-optimus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also reported</a> that xAI told investors it plans to build AI for humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its letter to shareholders, Tesla highlighted these and other developments in physical AI and robotics, including plans for developing its Optimus robot, semitrucks, and other autonomous capabilities. The company broadly beat Wall Street estimates on earnings and revenue, but profit <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fell 46% last year</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Together, the investment and the related framework agreement are intended to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale,” Tesla said in the shareholder letter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investment is expected to close in the first quarter. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elon Musk’s X is the latest social network to roll out a feature to label edited images as “manipulated media,” if a post by Elon Musk is to be believed. But the company has not clarified how it will make this determination, or whether it includes images that have been edited using traditional tools, like Adobe’s Photoshop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, the only details on the new feature come from a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2016387626257813518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cryptic X post from Elon Musk</a> saying, “Edited visuals warning,” as he reshares an announcement of a new X feature made by the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/16i4s5d/using_investigative_journalism_to_answer_the/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">anonymous</a> X account <a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/2016385433849221135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">DogeDesigner</a>. That account is often used as a proxy for introducing new X features, as Musk will repost from it to share news.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, details on the new system are thin. DogeDesigner’s post claimed X’s new feature could make it “harder for legacy media groups to spread misleading clips or pictures.” It also claimed the feature is new to X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before it was acquired and renamed as X, the company known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/twitters-policy-on-deepfakes-and-manipulated-media-will-only-remove-harmful-tweets-including-voter-suppression/\">Twitter had labeled tweets</a> using manipulated, deceptively altered, or fabricated media as an alternative to removing them. Its policy wasn’t limited to AI but included things like “selected editing or cropping or slowing down or overdubbing, or manipulation of subtitles,” the site integrity head, Yoel Roth, said in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear if X is adopting the same rules or has made any significant changes to tackle AI. Its help <a href=\"https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/authenticity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">documentation</a> currently says there’s a policy against sharing inauthentic media, but it’s rarely enforced, as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">recent deepfake debacle</a> of users sharing non-consensual nude images showed. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/us/politics/nekima-armstrong-photo-white-house.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">even the White House now shares manipulated images.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling something “manipulated media” or an “AI image” can be nuanced. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that X is a playground for <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-turned-x-trump-echo-chamber-rcna174321\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">political</a> <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2024/02/16/china-based-propaganda-accounts-flourish-on-x-as-others-try-to-curb-them/72628213007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">propaganda</a>, both domestically and abroad, some understanding of how the company determines what’s “edited,” or perhaps AI-generated or AI-manipulated, should be documented. In addition, users should know whether or not there’s any sort of dispute process beyond X’s crowdsourced Community Notes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Meta discovered when it introduced AI image labeling in 2024, it’s easy for detection systems to go awry. In its case, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/meta-tagging-real-photos-made-with-ai/\">Meta was found to be incorrectly tagging</a> real photographs with its “Made with AI” label, even though they had not been created using generative AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This happened because AI features are increasingly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/adobe-brings-firefly-ai-powered-generative-remove-to-lightroom/\">being integrated</a> into creative tools used by photographers and graphic artists. (Apple’s new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/with-apples-new-creator-studio-pro-ai-is-a-tool-to-aid-creation-not-replace-it/\">Creator Studio suite, launching today</a>, is one recent example.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it turned out, this confused Meta’s identification tools. For instance, Adobe’s cropping tool was flattening images before saving them as a JPEG, triggering Meta’s AI detector. <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2024/05/28/instagram-photos-are-being-labeled-made-with-ai-when-theyre-not/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In another example,</a> Adobe’s Generative AI Fill, which is used to remove objects — like wrinkles in a shirt, or an unwanted reflection — was also causing images to be labeled as “Made with AI,” when they were only edited with AI tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/01/meta-changes-its-label-from-made-with-ai-to-ai-info-to-indicate-use-of-ai-in-photos/\">Meta updated its label to say “AI info,</a>” so as not to outright label images as “Made with AI” when they had not been. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, there’s a standards-setting body for verifying the authenticity and content provenance for digital content, known as the <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">C2PA</a> (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity). There are also related initiatives like <a href=\"https://contentauthenticity.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CAI</a>, or Content Authenticity Initiative, and <a href=\"https://iptc.org/media-provenance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Project Origin</a>, focused on adding tamper-evident provenance metadata to media content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Presumably, X’s implementation would abide by some sort of known process for identifying AI content, but X’s owner, Elon Musk, didn’t say what that is. Nor did he clarify whether he’s talking specifically about AI images, or just anything that’s not the photo being uploaded to X directly from your smartphone’s camera. It’s even unclear whether the feature is brand-new, as DogeDesigner claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X isn’t the only outlet grappling with manipulated media. In addition to Meta, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/tiktok-now-lets-you-choose-how-much-ai-generated-content-you-want-to-see/\">TikTok</a> has also been labeling AI content. Streaming services like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/deezer-starts-labeling-ai-generated-music-to-tackle-streaming-fraud/\">Deezer</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/spotify-updates-ai-policy-to-label-tracks-cut-down-on-spam/\">Spotify</a> are also scaling initiatives to identify and label AI music, as well. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/16496549?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google Photos is using C2PA</a> to indicate how photos on its platform were made. Microsoft, the BBC, Adobe, Arm, Intel, Sony, OpenAI, and others are on <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/membership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the C2PA’s steering committee</a>, while many more companies have joined as members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X is not currently listed among the <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/membership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">members</a>, though we’ve reached out to C2PA to see if that recently changed. X doesn’t typically respond to requests for comment, but we asked anyway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Whew!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reason for the excitement? Outtake, founded in 2023 by a former Palantir engineer, Alex Dhillon, has found a way to automate what has largely been the manual problem of spotting and taking down digital identity posers: impersonation accounts, malicious domains posing as the company’s, rogue apps, fraudulent ads, and more. This problem has grown even more difficult because AI has enabled attackers to be more convincing and faster in their efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We kept hearing whispers in our network about an AI company that was finally solving digital misrepresentation at scale. Honestly, we were skeptical,” Joshi told TechCrunch. “Historically, detection and takedown was (and to some extent even today) a manual, human-intensive process that couldn’t keep up with the speed of the internet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But once Iconiq looked at the product and did its due diligence with customers, the investor became a believer, he said. “They’ve turned a ‘human problem’ into a ‘software problem.’ Seeing AI take down digital frauds in real time is a game-changer for brand safety,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outtake names among its customers OpenAI, Pershing Square, AppLovin, and federal agencies.

Total revenue from car sales fell 11% year-over-year, too. Tesla already revealed that it shipped 1.63 million cars globally across 2025. That marks the second year in a row that its sales have declined, after Musk spent years promising average annual growth of 50%.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors largely expected the decline in sales in Tesla’s fourth quarter and full-year results for 2025, and the company beat Wall Street’s estimates for earnings and revenue, sending shares up in after-market trading Wednesday. It’s been largely buoyed by strength in its other industries and investments, including energy capabilities and AI, as Tesla has continued to lure investors’ attention away from its stalled-out automotive business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company wrote in its shareholder letter: “2025 marked a critical year for Tesla as we further expanded our mission and continued our transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company revealed in the letter that it recently invested $2 billion in Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI, part of the latter’s recent <a href=\"https://x.ai/news/series-e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Series E funding round</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revenue from Tesla’s solar and energy storage businesses also grew 25% compared to 2024, and services revenue (which includes payments for Full Self-Driving software, insurance, parts, and Supercharging) grew 18%.

This partnership involves further embedding of Anthropic’s AI models into ServiceNow’s platform for its customers and bringing Anthropic’s AI to its employees.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ServiceNow declined to clarify the duration of the partnership or the monetary size of the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal entails making Anthropic’s Claude model family the preferred AI models across ServiceNow’s AI-driven workflow products. Claude is now also the default model powering the company’s AI agent builder, ServiceNow Build Agent, which allows developers to create agentic workflows and build apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal also involves the rollout of Claude to the company’s 29,000 ServiceNow employees. Claude Code, Anthropic’s vibe-coding product, is also available to the company’s engineers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“ServiceNow with Anthropic is turning intelligence into action through AI-native workflows for the world’s largest enterprises,” Bill McDermott, chairman and CEO of ServiceNow, said in a company press release. “Together, we are proving that deeply integrated platforms with an open ecosystem are how the future is built.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This news comes just a week after the company announced a new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/openai-is-coming-for-those-sweet-enterprise-dollars-in-2026/\">AI partnership with Anthropic rival OpenAI </a>that involved giving ServiceNow customers access to OpenAI’s models through the company’s products.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ServiceNow president, COO and CPO, Amit Zavery, said the company is intentionally pursuing a multi-model strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t view these partnerships as competitive or mutually exclusive,” Zavery said over email. “Enterprise customers want model choice.

The company ultimately decided to stick with the $33 million bid it received from MicroVision during <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/luminar-receives-a-larger-33-million-bid-for-its-lidar-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an auction on Monday</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The identity of who submitted this long-shot offer was not revealed, but Luminar’s lawyer said it was an “insider purchaser,” meaning it likely came from company founder Austin Russell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell had already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/ousted-luminar-ceo-austin-russell-wants-to-buy-the-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tried to buy the company</a> late last year before it slid into bankruptcy (and after he abruptly resigned as CEO). Representatives of his new firm Russell AI Labs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/luminar-founder-austin-russell-agrees-to-accept-subpoena-in-bankruptcy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">previously told TechCrunch</a> he was interested in submitting a bid on the lidar business during the bankruptcy case. (Those same representatives did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hearing moved forward, and the sale to MicroVision was approved. The sale of Luminar’s semiconductor division to a company called Quantum Computing Inc. was also approved. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transactions are likely to close in the coming weeks, and after that, the company will cease to exist, bringing an end to one of the buzzier suppliers of the budding autonomous vehicle era.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-microvision-wants\">What MicroVision wants</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell’s goal of using lidar to help cars drive themselves will continue on at MicroVision, according to its CEO Glen DeVos. As part of the asset sale, MicroVision will get Luminar’s lidar tech as well as its remaining staff, and he said he’s hopeful some of the other talent that was laid off prior to bankruptcy will come on board, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For DeVos, Luminar’s lidar technology is the piece MicroVision has been missing from his company’s portfolio. The Redmond, Washington-based company doesn’t have the same profile as the leaders in the lidar sector like Aeva, Innoviz, Hesai, or Ouster, but that’s in part because it lacked the long-range sensing capability that is crucial to automotive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MicroVision has a “very strong” software team, DeVos said in an interview with TechCrunch, and a similarly strong short-range lidar team. But DeVos, who spent a long career at automotive suppliers Delphi and Aptiv, and took over as MicroVision CEO last year, wants to expand beyond its current markets of industrial use, security, and defense.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So when we look at the Luminar engineering team, and what they’ve done, we said: ‘Hey, that’s a great compliment from an engineering capability standpoint,’” Devos said. “That’s critical in this area in terms of trying to win automotive business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeVos said he’s hopeful that MicroVision can take Luminar’s existing commercial engagements with automakers — even the ones in tatters, like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contract with Volvo</a> — and use those as a springboard into automotive, which would represent a huge new pool of potential revenue for his company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve been in the automotive industry a long time. I have experience where contractual relationships have gone off the rails, and basically, worked very hard to put those back together. We’re going to look at every single one of those. We’re not going to assume any of them are beyond saving,” he said. “You never want to get there, but, you know, there’s ways of putting those pieces back together.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-second-mystery-bidder\">A second mystery bidder?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the sale approval is behind him, Tuesday’s offer wasn’t the first time DeVos and MicroVision found themselves up against a mysterious bidder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the hearing, lawyers for Luminar and Rich Morgner, a managing director at Jeffries (which was helping run the sale process), revealed that another unidentified party was forming a bid as far back as January 12.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That bid was problematic from the jump, Morgner said. At first, the party’s financing was coming from a “Chinese national company.” When Luminar expressed concerns about regulatory approval, Morgner said the bidder replaced its funding with three different non-Chinese sources.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One was family money, which we were ultimately able to verify. The second was an SPV under the Caymans, which had a brokerage statement showing a round number of funds. And then we also had a European family office that was also part of the financing syndicate,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the lawyers and bankers were able to verify the “family money” was dependable, Morgner said the large round number in the Caymans SPV seemed suspicious.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The concern was the money came in … [so] money could come out. It wasn’t like looking at a long, dated brokerage statement, where you could see the ebbs and flows in the various different securities,” he said. Proof of funds from the European family office source was also never provided.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar’s lawyers never revealed the identity of the bidder, or whether it was the same party that submitted the offer that disrupted Tuesday’s hearing.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta announced Wednesday that it will charge developers for running chatbots on WhatsApp in regions where regulators are forcing the company to allow them. The move comes after the company’s ban on third-party chatbots on WhatsApp took effect on January 15. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Meta will charge developers in Italy, where the country’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/italy-tells-meta-to-suspend-its-policy-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/\">competition watchdog asked the company to suspend its policy last December</a>. The company said that the new pricing for non-template responses will begin on February 16. Meta plans to charge $0.0691/ €0.0572 / £0.0498 per message to developers for AI responses. This could result in steep bills for developers if users are exchanging thousands of queries with AI chatbots every day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Meta sent notices to developers creating an exemption for Italian phone numbers and allowing AI chatbots to serve those customers. At that time, the company didn’t mention any plans to charge developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, WhatsApp already charges companies for using its API for various template responses to customers, which include use cases like marketing, utility, or authentication. This includes messages users receive about payment reminders and shipping updates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where we are legally required to provide AI chatbots through the WhatsApp business API, we are introducing pricing for the companies that choose to use our platform to provide those services,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. This could also establish a precedent for other geographies if Meta has to cave in and allow developers to operate their chatbots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta first announced this past October that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/whatssapp-changes-its-terms-to-bar-general-purpose-chatbots-from-its-platform/\">it would block all third-party AI chatbots from using WhatsApp through its WhatsApp Business API</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta said its systems weren’t designed to handle responses from AI bots and were being strained. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. This logic assumes WhatsApp is somehow a de facto app store. The route to market for AI companies is the app stores themselves, their websites, and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform,” the company said at that time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, various regions, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/eu-investigating-meta-over-policy-change-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/\">the EU</a>, Italy, and Brazil, have started anticompetitive probes. Brazil’s watchdog initially <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/brazil-orders-meta-to-suspend-policy-banning-third-party-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/\">asked Meta to suspend the policy</a>. However, a court in Brazil <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/brazil-court-suspends-antitrust-ruling-against-meta-over-whatsapp-business-2026-01-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sided with Meta last week</a> and overturned the preliminary order blocking the new policy. As a result, the company has asked developers not to provide their AI chatbots to users in Brazil, TechCrunch has learned. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since the policy has kicked in, developers are forced to send a pre-defined message to users of their AI chatbot on WhatsApp to redirect them to their site or app. Providers like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Microsoft announced last year that their WhatsApp bots would not work after January 15, urging users to access them on other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Cleanlab, founded in 2021, is a startup that provides software for improving the quality of data produced by human labelers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal’s purpose is primarily to acquire talent, aka an acqui-hire, adding nine key Cleanlab employees to Handshake’s research organization. This includes the startup’s co-founders, who earned their PhDs in computer science from MIT: Curtis Northcutt (pictured above), Jonas Mueller, and Anish Athalye. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed (though, as we previously reported, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/18/selling-a-startup-in-an-acqui-hire-is-more-lucrative-than-it-seems-founders-and-vcs-say/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sometimes an acqui-hire can be surprisingly lucrative</a> for founders.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cleanlab has raised a total of $30 million from investors, including Menlo Ventures, TQ Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Databricks Ventures. At its peak, the startup had more than 30 employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cleanlab’s researchers are experts in developing algorithms that flag incorrect data without a second human reviewer. The goal is to improve the quality of the data Handshake produces for AI labs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have an in-house research team that thinks a lot about where our models are weak, what data should we be producing?

Now Google is flexing its own AI muscle by adding similar features to Chrome, the world’s <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">largest</a> browser by market share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Google had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/google-brings-gemini-in-chrome-to-us-users-unveils-agentic-browsing-capabilities-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">introduced Gemini to Chrome last September</a>, the assistant lived in a floating window. With this update, the company will put its AI helper into a persistent sidebar, so you can ask questions about the current website or other open tabs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One interesting feature Google demoed to press ahead of today’s launch involved multiple tabs. When you open different tabs from a single web page, the Gemini sidebar understands them as a context group.

This feature will roll out in Chrome in the coming months, meaning that you can ask Gemini in the sidebar about things like your family’s schedule, or ask it to draft an email and send it without switching to Gmail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a new Nano Banana integration coming to Chrome, too, that allows you to modify an existing image with another image or product that you find while browsing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the most ambitious feature is called auto-browse, which aims to handle tasks for you by using your personal information and traversing websites on your behalf. For instance, you can ask the agentic feature to go to a particular website and buy an item for you, and find a discount coupon. The agent will ask for your intervention when performing data-sensitive tasks, such as logging into a website or making a final purchase. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, the company explained that these features would use Chrome’s password manager or saved card details, but said its AI models wouldn’t be exposed to any of these details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This feature is rolling out initially to AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Browser-based agents are finicky and often fail to complete tasks.

In real-world use cases, agents often don’t get the intent or break during traversing different sites, and that would be a challenge for wider adoption.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that in its early testing, users have used the feature for tasks such as scheduling appointments, filling out tedious online forms, collecting their tax documents, getting quotes for plumbers and electricians, and filing expense reports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that the Gemini sidebar support and Nano Banana integration are arriving starting today, while the personal intelligence feature will be available in the “coming months.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It said that Patreon must <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">move all its creators to subscription billing</a> using Apple’s in-app purchase system by November 2025 or else Patreon would risk removal from the App Store. Apple made this decision because Patreon was managing the billing for some percentage of creators’ subscriptions, and the tech giant saw that as skirting its App Store commission structure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To Apple’s credit, Patreon was given plenty of time to migrate its customers to Apple’s in-app purchases. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">would switch creators to subscription billing</a> in November 2024, and creators could choose whether to increase their subscription prices to cover Apple’s fees. In addition, creators could opt to delay changes until November 2025 if they needed more time. However, they wouldn’t be able to offer subscriptions in the app until they adopted Apple’s in-app purchases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last May, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/patreons-app-can-now-accept-web-payments-after-u-s-app-store-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Patreon took advantage of</a> newly loosened App Store guidelines resulting from the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.S. court ruling in Epic v. Apple</a> to offer creators the ability to process web payments from links in Patreon’s app. At the time, Patreon told creators that the earlier November 2025 deadline was no longer in effect. This gave creators even more time to decide what to do about their subscription businesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says now that its decision to pause the transition for its creators may have added to the confusion given that Apple is now reimposing a transition deadline of November 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Patreon is complying with Apple’s decision, it’s clearly bristling at the idea that the tech giant should have a say in how creators run their businesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We strongly disagree with this decision,” its blog post states. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Creators need consistency and clarity in order to build healthy, long-term businesses. Instead, creators using legacy billing will now have to endure the whiplash of another policy reversal — the third such change from Apple in the past 18 months. Over the years, we have proposed multiple tools and features to Apple that we could’ve built to allow creators using legacy billing to transition on their own timelines, with more support added in. Unfortunately, Apple has continually declined them,” it says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creators can read more about the transition plan on <a href=\"https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/28801582599181-iOS-In-app-Purchases-and-Migrating-to-Subscription-Billing-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Patreon’s website</a>. It has also built several tools to support these changes, including a <a href=\"https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/35894742951565-Track-your-members-benefit-eligibility-status\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">benefit eligibility tool</a> to see who has paid or is scheduled to pay, <a href=\"https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027992451-Best-practices-for-increasing-your-tier-prices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tier repricing tools</a>, and gifting and <a href=\"https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/31517382056717-Discounts-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discount</a> tools to offer payment flexibility.

Still, despite its size, it’s not a true SOTA competitor yet because it currently supports only text. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More modes are in the works — a vision model is currently in development, and a speech-to-text version is on the roadmap, CTO Lucas Atkins told TechCrunch (pictured above, on the left). In comparison, Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick is already multi-modal, supporting text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But before adding more AI modes to its roster, Arcee says, it wanted a base LLM that would impress its main target customers: developers and academics. The team particularly wants to woo U.S. companies of all sizes away from choosing open models from China. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ultimately, the winners of this game, and the only way to really win over the usage, is to have the best open-weight model,” Atkins said. “To win the hearts and minds of developers, you have to give them the best.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benchmarks show that the Trinity base model, currently in preview while more post-training takes place, is largely holding its own and, in some cases, slightly besting Llama on tests of coding and math, common sense, knowledge, and reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The progress Arcee has made so far to become a competitive AI Lab is impressive. The large Trinity model follows <a href=\"https://www.arcee.ai/blog/the-trinity-manifesto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">two previous small models</a> released in December: the 26B-parameter Trinity Mini, a fully post-trained reasoning model for tasks ranging from web apps to agents, and the 6B-parameter Trinity Nano, an experimental model designed to push the boundaries of models that are tiny yet chatty.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The kicker is, Arcee trained them all in six months for $20 million total, using 2,048 Nvidia Blackwell B300 GPUs. This out of the roughly $50 million the company has raised so far, said founder and CEO Mark McQuade (pictured above, on the right). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That kind of cash was “a lot for us,” said Atkins, who led the model-building effort. Still, he acknowledged that it pales in comparison to how much bigger labs are spending right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The six-month timeline “was very calculated,” said Atkins, whose career before LLMs involved building voice agents for cars. “We are a younger startup that’s extremely hungry. We have a tremendous amount of talent and bright young researchers who, when given the opportunity to spend this amount of money and train a model of this size, we trusted that they’d rise to the occasion. And they certainly did, with many sleepless nights, many long hours.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McQuade, previously an early employee at open source model marketplace Hugging Face, says Arcee didn’t start out wanting to become a new U.S. AI lab: The company was originally doing model customization for large enterprise clients like SK Telecom. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were only doing post-training. So we would take the great work of others: We would take a Llama model, we would take a Mistral model, we would take a Qwen model that was open source, and we would post-train it to make it better” for a company’s intended use, he said, including doing the reinforcement learning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as their client list grew, Atkins said, the need for their own model was becoming a necessity, and McQuade was worried about relying on other companies. At the same time, many of the best open models were coming from China, which U.S. enterprises were leery of, or were barred from using. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a nerve-wracking decision. “I think there’s less than 20 companies in the world that have ever pre-trained and released their own model” at the size and level that Arcee was gunning for, McQuade said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company started small at first, trying its hand at a tiny, 4.5B model created in partnership with training company DatologyAI. The project’s success then encouraged bigger endeavors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if the U.S. already has Llama, why does it need another open weight model? Atkins says by choosing the open source Apache license, the startup is committed to always keeping its models open. This comes after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-meta-likely-wont-open-source-all-of-its-superintelligence-ai-models/\">indicated his company might not always</a> make all of its most advanced models open source. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Llama can be looked at as not truly open source as it uses a Meta-controlled license with commercial and usage caveats,” he says. This has caused <a href=\"https://opensource.org/blog/metas-llama-license-is-still-not-open-source\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some open source organizations to claim</a> that Llama isn’t open source compliant at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Arcee exists because the U.S. needs a permanently open, Apache-licensed, frontier-grade alternative that can actually compete at today’s frontier,” McQuade said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All Trinity models, large and small, can be downloaded for free. The largest version will be released in three flavors. Trinity Large Preview is a lightly post-trained instruct model, meaning it’s been trained to follow human instructions, not just predict the next word, which gears it for general chat usage. Trinity Large Base is the base model without post-training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then we have TrueBase, a model with any instruct data or post training so enterprises or researchers that want to customize it won’t have to unroll any data, rules, or assumptions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arcee AI will eventually offer a hosted version of its general-release model for, it says, competitive API pricing. That release is up to six weeks away as the startup continues to improve the model’s reasoning training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">API pricing for Trinity Mini is $0.045 / $0.15, and there is a rate-limited free tier available, too. Meanwhile, the company still sells post-training and customization options. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

tool that handles more of the basics and tedious tasks — like generating a slideshow for you to edit from your notes, extracting chord information from a song, searching across hours of video footage for the clip you need, changing the camera angle on your images, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tools in Creator Studio Pro are not new, but they’ve never been packaged as a

And with the addition of AI features, the company likely sees the possibility of making its creative software more accessible to those who aren’t fully professionals — like an indie musician or artist who wants to improve their marketing and sales, those who quickly compile video footage to post on social media, or those who want to create music or art and edit the output. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether Apple’s tools are the right ones for the job compared with Adobe products will depend on the user’s specific needs and their familiarity with professional creative tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each tool in the suite has received its own series of upgrades timed with this launch, both AI and otherwise.

Meanwhile, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform will remain free apps, but the new, premium features will be locked behind the subscription.

Others involve the use of third parties, like OpenAI, which powers things like advanced image generation, Keynote slides, and presenter notes. Creator Studio’s AI features either are processed on the device or use a private relay to anonymize the traffic. Apple says these protections mean users’ content is kept private and never used for AI training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Zoox robotaxi was traveling along 15th street when a street ambassador named Jamel Durden opened the driver’s-side door of his 1977 Cadillac Coupe DeVille, according to Mission Local, which <a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2026/01/sf-zoox-autonomous-car-crash-accident/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported the crash</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Durden’s hand was reportedly smashed during the crash, and the Zoox vehicle suffered damage to its glass doors. The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) told TechCrunch the Zoox vehicle was carrying a passenger at the time, which has not been previously reported. That passenger was an employee of Zoox, according to the company, and was not injured, which the SFPD confirmed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The police department declined to provide TechCrunch with an incident report “[d]ue to the fact it is still an open investigation.” Zoox filed its own police report about the incident, the company told TechCrunch, but said no additional details have been requested. In a statement on January 20, Zoox said it was “cooperating with local authorities to provide an accurate account of the incident.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, has also met with Zoox about the January 17 crash. The DMV told TechCrunch that Zoox filed a crash report “in compliance with California regulations.” That report is not yet publicly available. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox is in the early stages of building out its robotaxi service in San Francisco. In November, the company started offering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/zoox-to-begin-offering-robotaxi-rides-to-public-in-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free rides to members of the public</a> who are part of the “Zoox Explorer” early-rider program. The company is operating a similar program in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This rollout has come with challenges. The Amazon-owned company issued a recall in December to fix an issue where some of its vehicles were crossing center lanes and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/zoox-issues-software-recall-over-lane-crossings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blocking crosswalks</a>. (Zoox also issued <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/zoox-issues-second-robotaxi-software-recall-in-a-month-following-collision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two different software updates</a> during recalls earlier in 2025 before it started offering public rides.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The January crash in San Francisco happened when Durden “suddenly opened” the door of his car into the path of the robotaxi, according to Zoox. The company said the robotaxi “identified the opening door and tried to avoid it but contact was unavoidable.” (Durden could not be reached for comment.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox also said it offered medical attention to Durden, who allegedly declined. According to Mission Local, Durden refused medical treatment until his car was towed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Safety and transparency are foundational to Zoox, and we are cooperating with local authorities to provide an accurate account of the incident,” the company said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But just as LLMs speed up the coding process, the old problems of hosting, security, and general DevOps problems have persisted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s an obvious business opportunity in solving that problem, but with the system changing so quickly, it’s hard to know how to grab hold of it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the more interesting answers comes from <a href=\"https://modelence.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Modelence</a>, a Y Combinator startup from this summer’s batch that announced on Wednesday it raised a $3 million seed round. Y Combinator led the round, with participation from Rebel Fund, Acacia Venture Capital Partners, Formosa VC, and Vocal Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modelence isn’t the only company going after this sector. Giants like Google and Amazon, as well as smaller startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/shuttle-raises-6-million-to-fix-vibe-codings-deployment-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shuttle</a>, are all trying to solve the infrastructure issue.<br><br>California-based Modelence stands out for how it’s diagnosing the problem. For CEO Aram Shatakhtsyan, the issue isn’t individual services; it’s the connections between them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You don’t want to ask AI to go build authentication and then set up a database and then connect them together, because it’s very likely to break,” Shatakhtsyan told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an interesting diagnosis because it explains how there can be so many world-class service providers contributing to such a rickety system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Vercel covers most of your front end, and Supabase covers the database and the layer on top of it. But you still have to stitch the rest of it together,” he said, explaining the various products software engineers use today. “In the best case, you get two cloud systems.” In short, there is a lot of room to make mistakes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modelence’s approach is to provide something like an all-in-one service. Their framework, or toolkit, works on TypeScript, with the company handling authentication, databases, hosting, LLM observability tools, and even their own Lovable-style app builder just to eliminate the extra friction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an interesting idea, and it will be fun to see if they can draw in users. But with the landscape for code-adjacent tools changing this fast, it will be a real challenge just keeping up.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just two outlet stores in the U.S. and two full-price stores in London will remain.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is an important step for Allbirds, as we drive toward profitable growth under our turnaround strategy,” Allbirds CEO Joe Vernachio said in a statement. “We have been opportunistically reducing our brick-and-mortar portfolio over the past two years. By exiting these remaining unprofitable doors, we are taking actions to reduce costs and support the long-term health of the business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The typical Allbirds wearer knows that this kind of corporate speak is a thinly veiled way to say the current financial outlook of the company isn’t great.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Allbirds was founded in San Francisco in 2015 and quickly became the “it” shoe among startup employees (even TechCrunch staffers once received branded gray Allbirds shoes as company swag — is our current lack of matching footwear a recession indicator?). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shoes are admittedly quite comfortable, but ugly in a way that only unstylish tech bros would seek out (the <a href=\"https://www.allbirds.com/products/mens-wool-runners-natural-white?size=8&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=Shopping+%2F%2F+US+%2F%2F+Allbirds+Brand+%2F%2F+Catch+All&amp;utm_content=732888300402_172224032822&amp;utm_term=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=17505301853&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADfIYPmr9CJb3MXyCDqyvNC42DCrW&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAhOfLBhCCARIsAJPiopOxoDgXTeixpJTqA1IYjidffp9XgwMn_VpEmCynzgiflhtnRqdXKVgaAkA6EALw_wcB&amp;variant=28847739371600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">white wool runners</a> are cool in a minimalist way, though). They’re like Skechers, embracing comfort above all else, but they’re more expensive. And unlike Skechers, Allbirds did not create a line of footwear with the one and only Martha Stewart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the companies that its customers probably work for, Allbirds raised enough venture capital to secure an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trendy-sneaker-startup-allbirds-laces-up-1-4-billion-valuation-1539281112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">overly inflated unicorn valuation</a>, only to go public in 2021 and flounder. The company’s market capitalization is now about $32 million and its stock hovers at just a few dollars per share, but at least it has the very cool Nasdaq ticker symbol $BIRD.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t quite the end of the Allbirds era. The shoes remain available online, and while expensive, they are genuinely pretty good shoes. But perhaps it marks the end of an era in which working in tech seemed like the ticket to lifelong stability. Now your company can only afford branded Patagonia vests if you’re working in AI, and even then, you might be haunted by an undercurrent of anxiety that the AI bubble might burst.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps this anxiety is fueling the next era of Silicon Valley style, in which everything needs to be as efficient as possible. Tech bros now wear Oura rings to track their biometric data, log their macros on MyFitnessPal, and eat Sweetgreen “Power Max” protein bowls with <a href=\"https://www.eatingwell.com/sweetgreen-power-max-protein-bowl-11852250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over 100 grams of protein</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that light, maybe it makes sense that people are so <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/were-not-nostalgic-for-2016-were-nostalgic-for-the-internet-before-all-the-slop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nostalgic for 2016</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
