These new capabilities are designed to make building and fine-tuning custom large language models (LLMs) easier for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cloud provider is introducing serverless model customization in SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure, according to Ankur Mehrotra, general manager of AI platforms at AWS, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To access these serverless model-building capabilities, developers can either follow a self-guided point-and-click path or an agent-led experience where they can prompt SageMaker using natural language. The agent-led feature is launching in preview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re a healthcare customer and you wanted a model to be able to understand certain medical terminology better, you can simply point SageMaker AI, if you have labeled data, then select the technique and then off SageMaker goes, and [it] fine tunes the model,” Mehrotra said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This capability is available for customizing Amazon’s own Nova models and certain open source models (those with publicly available model weights), including DeepSeek and Meta’s Llama.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is also launching Reinforcement Fine-Tuning in Bedrock that allows developers to choose either a reward function or a pre-set workflow, and Bedrock will run a model customization process automatically from start to finish.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Frontier LLMs — meaning the most advanced AI models — and model customization appear to be an area of focus for AWS at this year’s conference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced Nova Forge, a service where AWS will build custom Nova models for its enterprise customers for $100,000 a year, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s keynote on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A lot of our customers are asking, ‘If my competitor has access to the same model, how do I differentiate myself?’” Mehrotra said. “‘How do I build unique solutions that are optimized, that optimize my brand, for my data, for my use case, and how do I differentiate myself?’ What we’ve found is that, the key to solving that problem is being able to create customized models.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS has yet to gain a substantial user base for its AI models. A July survey from Menlo Ventures found that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">enterprises greatly prefer Anthropic</a>, OpenAI, and Gemini to other models. However, the ability to customize and fine-tune these LLMs could start to give AWS a competitive advantage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\">annual enterprise tech event here</a>, and see all the announcements <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/all-the-biggest-news-from-aws-big-tech-show-reinvent-2025/\">you may have missed thus far here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Milan-based tech conglomerate <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bendingspoons.com/\">Bending Spoons</a> this week <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bendingspoons.com/\">acquired</a> Eventbrite for $500 million, adding the event ticketing platform to its growing portfolio of recognizable consumer tech brands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal, announced Tuesday, marks the latest acquisition for the 12-year-old company that has quietly become one of the tech industry’s most prolific buyers — despite remaining largely unknown to the general public.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So what exactly is Bending Spoons? Despite its catchy name, the company has stayed remarkably under the radar, and it typically makes headlines only when it adds another recognizable brand to its portfolio — which now includes Evernote, WeTransfer, Meetup, and Streamyard, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Bending Spoons isn’t a traditional private equity firm or a pure financial investment vehicle. Its focus is on acquiring underperforming but popular tech brands, then transforming them to serve millions of users more efficiently. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company tends to make news when it restructures these acquired companies, often through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/bending-spoons-plans-to-lay-off-75-of-wetransfer-staff-after-acquisition/\">significant layoffs</a>, or makes <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/27/evernote-pushes-users-to-upgrade-with-test-of-a-free-plan-limited-to-only-50-notes/\">controversial changes</a> to beloved products — as it did with both Evernote and WeTransfer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Bending Spoons itself remains largely unknown, even though its roster of products has served more than a billion people, with over 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers. Here’s what you need to know about the company reshaping some of the internet’s most recognizable brands.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-bending-spoons\">What is Bending Spoons?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bending Spoons describes itself as a company that acquires and transforms digital businesses. Having grown to a headcount of 400 to 500 employees (whom the company calls “Spooners”), its main focus is on making improvements to products and services that others have created.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it didn’t start that way — Bending Spoons’ founders had taken a stab at building their own apps and products before eventually shifting their focus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The little-known backstory is that Bending Spoons was born out of the remains of Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2011/startup-alley/\">participated in Disrupt SF 2011’s Startup Alley</a> and raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/24/evertale-a-social-network-for-the-less-proactive-gets-seed-funding-from-mangrove/\">seed funding</a> for its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/24/evertale-a-social-network-for-the-less-proactive-gets-seed-funding-from-mangrove/\">photo-sharing app</a>, Wink. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Evertale failed not long after, and investors were able to exit, but its founders and a couple of employees kept working together, initially on in-house apps. Soon enough, the team made its first acquisition, followed by many others, CEO and co-founder Luca Ferrari told the venture podcast 20VC <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJyHmyjG204\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a rare interview.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2020, Bending Spoons made an exception when it created and donated Immuni, Italy’s official COVID-19 contact tracing app. But other than that, it has mostly been honing a formula: Bending Spoons identifies a popular product it thinks it can improve inside and out, and buys it from owners who have reached their limits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the acquisition, Bending Spoons is anything but a passive owner, making changes to the products’ user experience and features but also to the underlying tech; monetization strategy, including pricing; and team organization, including headcount.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this focus on efficiency and revenue overlaps with private equity strategies, Bending Spoons claims a key difference: it “aims to hold forever, and has never sold an acquired business.” It is building a live portfolio, not collecting internet relics or presiding over a tech graveyard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, Bending Spoons’ acquisition targets so far haven’t necessarily been failing businesses — many still had substantial user bases and revenue. But they’ve tended to be stagnant, neglected, or had owners looking to exit. Let’s recap these key deals, and also what happened in their aftermath.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-companies-has-bending-spoons-acquired\">What companies has Bending Spoons acquired?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bending Spoons acquired several companies between 2014 and 2021, including the AI-powered photo enhancer Remini, its most notable acquisitions happened more recently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, it acquired Filmic, known for its popular video- and photo-editing apps, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/bending-spoons-lays-off-entire-staff-of-flimic/\">laid off the entire staff</a> in December 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a deal also announced in 2022 and finalized in early 2023, Bending Spoons also acquired Evernote, the note-taking app that had reportedly reached a $1 billion valuation before hitting trouble. Layoffs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/bending-spoons-lays-off-129-evernote-staffers/\">followed the acquisition</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/its-official-evernote-will-restrict-free-users-to-50-notes/\">cuts to Evernote’s free offering</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first half of following year, 2024, was particularly active, with the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240124551711/en/Bending-Spoons-finalizes-acquisition-of-U.S.-based-community-building-platform-Meetup-and-announces-%2450000-Community-Fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquisition of Meetup</a>, app maker <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240110239723/en/Bending-Spoons-Acquires-Mosaic-Group-Digital-Assets-From-IAC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mosaic Group</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.northstarmeetingsgroup.com/Planning-Tips-and-Trends/Event-Planning/Event-Technology/Hopin-StreamYard-to-be-acquired-by-Bending-Spoons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hopin’s StreamYard</a> all happening within six months. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July 2024, it went on to acquire the publishing platform <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240719725742/en/Digital-Publishing-Platform-Issuu-Acquired-by-Bending-Spoons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Issuu</a> and the file transfer service <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bending-spoons-acquires-file-transfer-service-wetransfer/\">WeTransfer</a>, where it later <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/bending-spoons-plans-to-lay-off-75-of-wetransfer-staff-after-acquisition/\">cut staff</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/wetransfers-free-plan-now-has-a-monthly-limit-of-10-transfers/\">made changes to its free plan</a>, introducing stricter limits. Later in the year, Bending Spoons announced it would spend <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/bending-spoons-is-taking-video-platform-brightcove-private-in-233m-acquisition/\">$233 million</a> on an all-cash take-private deal to acquire video platform Brightcove. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisitions have continued apace in 2025, with acquisitions that include the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250320568940/en/Bending-Spoons-Acquires-komoot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">route planner Komoot</a> and management software maker <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/225798-22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Harvest</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bending Spoons also announced its intention to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/vimeo-to-be-acquired-by-bending-spoons-in-1-38b-all-cash-deal/\">acquire Vimeo</a> in a $1.38 billion all-cash deal, and soon after, to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/bending-spoons-to-acquire-aol/\">acquire AOL</a> from Yahoo for an undisclosed amount. (Disclosure: Both AOL and Yahoo are former owners of TechCrunch, in which Yahoo retains a small interest.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Bending Spoons, the acquisitions of AOL and Vimeo are expected to close by the end of the year, subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including, in the case of Vimeo, approval by its stockholders. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Bending Spoons acquired yet another well-known brand: Eventbrite. Once again, it will pay much less than Eventbrite was once worth — only some $500 million, a far cry from the company’s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/eventbrite-valued-at-1-76-billion-in-ipo-1537443074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$1.76 billion</a> valuation when it went public in 2018.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-much-is-bending-spoons-worth\">How much is Bending Spoons worth?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since October 2025, Bending Spoons has been one of Europe’s rare tech decacorns (companies valued at more than $10 billion). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This comes on the heels of Bending Spoons’ latest funding round: $270 million from investors including T. Rowe Price and earlier backers Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, Durable Capital Partners, and Fidelity, plus a $440 million secondary share sale by existing shareholders. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company last raised at a $2.8 billion valuation in 2024, making its updated $11 billion valuation a significant step up — also for its four co-founders, who joined the billionaire ranks as a result.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO Luca Ferrari’s stake in Bending Spoons is now reportedly worth $1.4 billion, while co-founders Matteo Danieli, Luca Querella, and Francesco Patarnello each hold stakes worth $1.3 billion, according to Forbes estimates based on shareholder data published by the Italian Business Register.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear whether any of the co-founders sold stock in the secondary transaction. Bending Spoons has declined to comment on its co-founders’ stakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though long bootstrapped, Bending Spoons had previously raised equity financing <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bending-spoons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">several times</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220927005732/en/Bending-Spoons-Raises-%24340-Million-in-Financing-as-Global-Demand-for-Mobile-First-Creator-Tools-Soars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in September 2022</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/evernote-and-meetup-owner-bending-spoons-raises-155m-in-equity-financing/\">early 2024</a>. It also has VIPs on its cap table, including tennis and entertainment stars Andre Agassi and Bradley Cooper; tech industry bigs Eric Schmidt, Mike Krieger, and Xavier Niel; and performers The Weeknd, The Chainsmokers, and Maluma.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upon announcing its new funding in October 2025, Bending Spoons said it would support future acquisitions and investment in its proprietary technology and AI capabilities. This comes in addition to the $2.8 billion in debt financing the company disclosed when it announced its intention to acquire AOL, debt that will fund the AOL deal and future acquisitions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-next\">What’s next?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bending Spoons said it intends to continue pursuing new acquisitions that expand its portfolio of consumer and enterprise digital products, and it now has funding to afford more prominent targets going forward — as confirmed by its decision to acquire Eventbrite.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AOL and Vimeo already carry far more name recognition than earlier targets, though the AOL terms remain undisclosed. The properties also have some reach. In announcing the AOL deal, Bending Spoons claimed that AOL remains one of the top 10 most-used email providers in the world, with 8 million daily active users and 30 million monthly active users. (Not long before acquiring AOL, Bending Spoons was also <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-11/bending-spoons-looks-to-buy-typeform-elysium-messaggero-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rumored</a> to be eyeing <a href=\"https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/bending_spoons_4_colpi_da_3_miliardi_di_dollari-9119455.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">app maker Elysium</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/typeform-series-c/\">Typeform</a>, the Barcelona-based SaaS company known for its form creation tools.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Presumably to support its continued efforts to acquire companies, it also has openings across various roles, with new hires initially working from its Milan headquarters before gaining the option to work from offices in London, Madrid, and Warsaw, or remotely. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, despite warning candidates that Bending Spoons is a “demanding environment,” the company has said it already received more than 600,000 job applications in 2025, a figure that will likely climb as its recent deals generate additional attention.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Specifically, the models were used to identify things like your “one true passion” and the other top four highlights that “made your year” in the Recap. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?w=396\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3072209\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg 896w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=175,300 175w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=768,1320 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=396,680 396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=698,1200 698w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=745,1280 745w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=250,430 250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=419,720 419w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=524,900 524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=465,800 465w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=894,1536 894w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=389,668 389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=218,375 218w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=359,617 359w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=309,531 309w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Google-Photos-Recap-2025-12-03-at-10.35.16-AM.jpg?resize=29,50 29w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, the recap will offer photo stats from the year, like total photo count, top people, and, new for this year, a total selfie count.

Just describe a movie scene like you would to a friend, and Alexa+ will jump directly to that specific moment—no more searching required.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says you can describe the scene to Alexa by mentioning details like the actor or character’s name, or a memorable quote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, you could say “Jump to the scene in Mamma Mia where Sophie sings ‘Honey Honey’” or “Jump to the scene where Deloris Jordan says ‘a shoe is just a shoe until my son steps into it’.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other examples include: “Jump to the scene when John McClane says ‘come out to the coast, we’ll get together, have a few laughs’” and “Jump to the card scene in Love Actually.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says Alexa+ can identify the movie you’re talking about even if you don’t mention the title. It then uses visual understanding and movie captions to understand the characters, plot, and action in scenes to determine the specific moment you’re looking for. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Alexa+, the new feature is built on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/28/amazon-launches-its-bedrock-generative-ai-service-in-general-availability/\">Amazon Bedrock</a>, which is Amazon’s service that offers a choice of generative AI models from the company itself and third-party partners through an API. The feature leverages a variety of large language models, including Amazon Nova and Anthropic Claude. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature works with thousands of movie titles available on Prime Video, including tens of thousands of indexed scenes, Amazon says. The company plans to add more movies and scenes, and expand the capability to TV shows soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that the feature will only work if the movie is included with a Prime membership, or if you have purchased or rented it on Prime Video. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That includes driverless taxi rides, sure, but also headier ideas like sending an autonomous vehicle to fetch groceries or pick up dry cleaning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If those things are ultimately going to happen, navigating the handoff moments — like where <em>exactly</em> a vehicle should stop to receive the groceries — will be a crucial piece of the puzzle. Palo Alto-based <a href=\"https://www.goautolane.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Autolane</a> is trying to build that layer of infrastructure, and it now has $7.4 million in fresh funding to take on that goal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Backed by VC firms like Draper Associates and Hyperplane, Autolane said it will start by coordinating pickup and drop-off points for companies that want to let robotaxis come onto their private property. The startup has signed a deal with Simon Property Group to coordinate driverless vehicle arrivals and departures at shopping centers owned by the real estate company in Austin, Texas and San Francisco, California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal will include creating simple, physical infrastructure like signage (think: the many kinds of Uber and Lyft pick-up and drop-off stanchions that decorate modern hotels and airports) and also software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe we are one of the first, let’s say, ‘application layer’ companies in autonomy,” Autolane co-founder and CEO Ben Seidl told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. “We aren’t the fundamental models. We’re not building the cars. We’re not doing anything like that. We are simply saying, as this industry balloons rapidly and has exponential growth — as is already occurring this year and will occur for the next 10 years straight — someone is going to have to sit in the middle and orchestrate, coordinate, and kind of evaluate what’s going on.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autolane is starting with robotaxis in mind, but Seidl is clearly focused on the bigger-picture idea of applying his company’s tech to all kinds of tasks autonomous vehicles might be able to perform in the future. And he wants to move quickly with Autolane because, as he sees it, the startup doesn’t have “any direct competition” right now. He expects that to change soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seidl said he was convinced there was a business here after buying a Tesla last year and using the company’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software for the first time.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As soon as my own personal car was driving me around town, pretty much flawlessly, I just — my head kind of exploded,” he said. “I was mostly enthralled by the idea that this was going to change logistics, retail, real estate, where we work, where we live, where we play, how we get around, what the price of movement of goods and services and people will be.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seidl cited the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/a-waymo-robotaxi-got-trapped-in-chick-fil-a-drive-through/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">viral incident from earlier this year</a> where a Waymo robotaxi got stuck navigating a Chick-fil-A drive-through in Santa Monica, California, as an example of the problem Autolane is trying to head off. In that case, the robotaxi had dropped off its passengers and then struggled to negotiate the fast food company’s notorious drive-through lanes. Seidl said by using Autolane software and designating an exact pick-up and drop-off location, problems like this can be avoided in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Someone has got to bring some order to this chaos, and the chaos is already starting,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies could surely do some of this work themselves, at least on the physical infrastructure side. It’s simply not that hard to make a sign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anyone can do that,” Seidl said. “That’s not the case, though, for autonomy. Robotics need precise instructions and precise geolocation and technological communication. You can’t just put up a white sign with some black letters and hope for the best with 10 different types of of robotics coming in.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, Seidl said the value of Autolane is in how it will integrate with the companies that own real estate as well as with the autonomous vehicle providers. That’s why the plan is to essentially build APIs for the physical locations so autonomous vehicle companies can receive these precise instructions. Businesses will have to “directly integrate into each one of these robotics companies, car companies, so that they follow your rules,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seidl also said he explicitly does not want to work with cities or municipalities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t work on public streets. We don’t work with public parking spots. We’re just providing these tools as kind of a B2B, hardware-enabled SAS solution so that Costco, or McDonald’s, or Home Depot, or, in our case, Simon Property Group, the world’s largest retail REIT [real estate investment trust] can begin to have what I like to refer to as ‘air traffic control for autonomous vehicles,’ meaning they know which ones are incoming and outgoing,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That has been the move in cities like Atlanta and Austin, for example, where Waymo has partnered with Uber to advance its robotaxi rollout.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the new locations join a list of over 20 cities where the company is either offering rides, prepping a commercial launch, or testing. Waymo is also now offering rides on freeways in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company plans to be doing one million rides per week by the end of 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has done all this while claiming to be operating at a level five times safer than humans, according to <a href=\"https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/new-data-shows-waymos-safe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">data</a> the company recently released. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the expansion has not come without its issues.

Plus, it’s offering more visibility into users’ data than in years past.

We use that as information, insights, [and] inspiration for how we approached Wrapped this year,” he said in a press event ahead of today’s launch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What our users tell us about Wrapped means a lot to us, so it was really informative in how we approached Wrapped this year. And what we tried to build was the most creative, most innovative, most engaging Wrapped ever,” he added, setting a high bar for the 2025 edition of the now 11-year-old annual year-in-review feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re the original and, we believe, still the best,” Luhks said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071967\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25W_Podcasts.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, AI was a part of the Wrapped experience. Though the company claims the overall experience was not made with AI, it does leverage a LLM (large language model) to add a storytelling layer to Wrapped’s facts and figures, and natural language summaries in other parts of its experience, looking back on your data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify’s attempt to fix Wrapped after a notable stumble comes as the streamer faces increased competition from Apple, Amazon, YouTube, and others, which have all launched their own annual review features, inspired by Wrapped. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everyone seems to have their own version of Wrapped. Now, there’s a lot of reviews and replays and rewinds out there, but we believe that Wrapped still sets the bar for these year-end recaps,” Luhks said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with the consumer experience, Spotify shared its top artists, songs, albums, podcasts, and audiobooks for the year, with top winners that included, respectively, Bad Bunny (top song and album), Joe Rogan (“The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast), and Rebeca Yarros (author of “Fourth Wing”). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new round, which opens on December 10, will enable consumers to buy the company’s shares at its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/nothing-closes-200m-series-c-led-by-tiger-global-plans-ai-first-device-launch/\">Series C valuation of $1.3 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it has so far raised $8 million in total from over 8,000 people across two previous community investment rounds. It held its first community <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/want-to-invest-in-nothing-carl-pei-opens-investment-opportunity-to-community/\">funding event in 2021, aiming to raise $1.5 million</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This isn’t about raising capital, it’s about giving our community/fans a chance to invest while we’re private and join us on the journey,” a spokesperson for Nothing told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Community investors have a rotating seat on the company’s board, but it is unclear what else they get for investing in the company through such rounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nothing raised $200 million in its Series C back in September from investors including Tiger Global, GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF and Tapestry. The company has raised $450 million to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The community round comes as Nothing makes changes to its corporate structure as it tries to increase its share of a smartphone market dominated by giants like Samsung and Apple. The company is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/smartphone-maker-nothing-to-spin-off-its-affordable-cmf-brand/\">spinning off its budget CMF brand</a>, and plans to explore AI-centric devices while it keeps building smartphones and audio products. And Nothing claims it crossed $1 billion in cumulative revenue this year, up 150% from 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is working to be “IPO-ready” in three years, CEO Carl Pei told TechCrunch in an email. “The timing will depend on market conditions and what makes sense for the business at that point in time,” he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What’s important is that we’re already operating with that discipline now. We’re building the systems, the governance, the financial discipline that a public company needs.

News of the mandate soon ignited concerns over privacy and state overreach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, the government has decided not to make pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” the ministry said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the government has not yet issued an official notification to smartphone makers reflecting the withdrawal, and manufacturers are still waiting for formal instructions, two manufacturer sources involved with the proceedings told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its release in January 2025, Sanchar Saathi has so far been downloaded 14 million times, and contributes information on roughly 2,000 cyber-fraud incidents per day, per the Indian government. The recent controversy boosted interest in the platform, and the ministry noted that about 600,000 citizens registered to download the app on December 2 alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The telecom ministry’s notice follows much confusion over whether the app was truly voluntary, as the government claimed. Telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia had <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/JM_Scindia/status/1995772731455926362\">insisted</a> earlier this week that users could delete Sanchar Saathi at any time, even though the directive circulating among manufacturers stated that the app’s functionalities “must not be disabled or restricted.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conflicting signals fueled criticism that the government was attempting to downplay the extent of its mandate. Critics warned that forcing a government app onto every smartphone, and preventing its features from being disabled would give authorities excessive visibility into users’ devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The directive had also raised concerns within the industry, with manufacturers privately questioning the feasibility of enforcing a permanent, system-level app without clear legal backing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deputy telecom minister Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/aseemmanchanda/status/1995824109465600365\">said</a> in media interviews that Apple did not participate in the working group for the initiative, though other smartphone makers did.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sanchar Saathi had more than 3 million monthly active users in November, according to marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Web traffic to Sanchar Saathi has also surged, with monthly unique visitors rising by more than 49% year-over-year, per Sensor Tower.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Internet Freedom Foundation, a New Delhi-based digital rights group, called the reversal a “welcome development,” but <a href=\"https://x.com/internetfreedom/status/1996160746753765423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">urged caution</a>, noting that it is still awaiting the legal order that should accompany the announcement. The group added that “cautious optimism, not closure,” was warranted until revised directions under the Cyber Security Rules, 2024, are published and independently verified.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other parts of the Sanchar Saathi ecosystem continue to expand. Recommerce and trade-in platforms are still required to validate devices through a central IMEI database, and the telecom ministry is also piloting an API that could allow these firms to submit customer and device information directly to the state. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The service comes with a few caveats, however, including the addition of a human safety operator behind the wheel, and a limited operating area. The companies said fully driverless operations, without a safety operator, will begin in the future and the service area will expand.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Uber, the launch closes out a year of rapid dealmaking — and deployments — with a variety of autonomous vehicle technology companies, including Waymo, China’s WeRide and San Francisco-based startup Nuro. To date, Uber has locked in 20 partnerships with AV companies across freight, delivery and robotaxis, some of which are now in commercial operation. Uber offers autonomous vehicles through its ride-hailing app in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/uber-and-werides-robotaxi-service-in-abu-dhabi-is-officially-driverless/\">Abu Dhabi and Riyadh with WeRide</a>, and in Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix with Waymo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber said it plans to have autonomous vehicles on its network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. Over the next two years, the plan is to launch AVs on its app in Arlington, Texas, Dubai, London, Los Angeles, Munich and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of these partnerships have included an investment by Uber, and Avride, an Austin-based startup that sits under parent company Nebius Group, is one of those.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October 2024, the ride-hailing company struck a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/uber-taps-yandex-spinout-avride-for-autonomous-delivery-and-ride-hail-partnership/\">multi-year deal</a> with Avride to bring its sidewalk delivery robots and autonomous vehicles to both Uber Eats and Uber. Within months, Avride’s sidewalk robots began delivering food via the Uber Eats app in Austin, Dallas and Jersey City.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This fall, Avride secured strategic investments and commercial commitments worth $375 million from Uber and Nebius, which was previously known as Yandex NV, the Netherlands-based company that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/05/yandex-to-sell-its-remaining-russian-businesses-for-5-2b-half-its-market-value/\">sold off its Russian business</a> in 2024.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber’s use of Avride sidewalk robots for its food delivery business was notable, but this robotaxi launch has arguably higher stakes for both companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The robotaxi fleet of all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles is equipped with Avride’s self-driving system, and will service a 9-square-mile area of Dallas that includes downtown.

Avride will initially manage its own fleet, and Uber will take over day-to-day fleet operations, including cleaning, maintenance, inspections, charging and depot management. From the start, Uber will provide end-to-end rider support, while Avride will oversee vehicle testing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber riders who request UberX, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric rides may be matched with an Avride robotaxi. The match is not guaranteed, and riders can increase their chances of getting a robotaxi by changing a setting in the Uber app. Robotaxi rides will cost the same as those operated by a human driver, according to Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When an Uber user is notified they’ve been matched with an Avride robotaxi, they can choose to accept or switch to a human-driven ride. Once the robotaxi arrives, riders can use the Uber app to unlock the vehicle, open the trunk and start the trip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new goal is to create interfaces and modalities that make it easier for users to create a habit of logging their meals or workouts, along with having an ever-present AI assistant that can guide people in areas like nutrition and exercise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khosla-backed health startup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.healthifyme.com/in/\">Healthify</a> on Tuesday launched a new version of its health assistant Ria, which you can converse with live, via voice, and by using the camera for getting input about your food.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is using OpenAI’s tech to power this conversational mode. With this release, Ria supports more than 50 languages, including 14 Indian languages. The company said that it can also support mixed language input like Hinglish or Spanglish. While the company is largely utilizing OpenAI’s models for this release, it said that in the future it could use other models if needed.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071955\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2a.-Ria-features-Color-bg-Screen-set-Screen-set-2.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Healthify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through the new version of Ria, users can ask for their health overview for specified time frames like day, week, or month, or an overall summary. The app can pull data from different sources like fitness trackers, sleep trackers, or glucose monitors to give users insights about exercise, sleep, readiness, and glucose spikes, and give suggestions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just like Google Gemini’s Live Conversation mode, you can point the camera to ask about different food items and their nutritional value, then log them. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Healthify App Demo AUG'25\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdjklamL25A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Healthify also showed off a demo of using Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to converse with Ria in real time and use the device’s camera to log food. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup believes its users will feel more comfortable chatting in real time with an assistant. Plus, they can do multiple things in one session, such as getting insights, generating an exercise plan, or logging their goals. If you forget to log your food for the day, you can describe your meals in one go instead of typing them out, and the assistant will log them for you.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, the company is looking to utilize its updated AI in more places. In the coming months, it plans to make the conversational assistant a central piece of user onboarding so it can gather more insights from unstructured conversations. (Notably, new-age dating apps have opted for this kind of interface to create better matches for users.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also creating a more persistent memory layer over OpenAI’s models and its assistant to have the app remember long-term context around preferences and health changes to give more personalized suggestions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Healthify is also making the assistant available in conversations with your coach or nutritionist to help either of you pull data or answer your questions when they are not available. Plus, it’s adding Ria to your calls with coaches and nutritionists so it can transcribe the calls for insights. Users or coaches can also ask Ria for data while they are on a call.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s CEO, Tushar Vashisht, said that the team trained Ria on years of conversational data between coaches and users to give grounded and accurate advice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apart from Healthify, other apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/former-whoop-execs-new-app-alma-uses-ai-for-all-things-nutrition/\">Alma</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/16/photo-calorie-app-cal-ai-downloaded-over-a-million-times-was-built-by-two-teenagers/\">Cal AI</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\">MyfitnessPal</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/workout-app-ladder-launches-nutrition-tracking-experience/\">Ladder</a> have created ways for users to input food intakes using voice, text, or images. Healthify believes that with its live conversation mode, data aggregation from various platforms, and AI trained on years of data, it has an edge over its competitors. What’s more, the company has added a way to access your gallery and automatically detect food photos to give you options for adding meals that you might have missed logging in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are focusing on creating a health ecosystem of nutrition-driven data with other integrations. From an AI perspective, we are putting in levers to solve for accountability in users when it comes to health,” the company’s CPO Paritosh Kumar told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Healthify, which has more than 45 million registered users and a few million active monthly users, is also launching a new AI plan in the U.S with updated Ria assistant and meal planning at $20 per month. Prior to this, the company had been testing various plans with text-based AI and certified nutrition coaches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it’s hoping to soon announce partnerships around its GLP-1-aided weight loss programs. In the coming months, Healthify also plans to partner with health tracking device companies to bring their data into Ria.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vashisht said the company may raise a new funding round in the near future, given its strong U.S. adoption and growth. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-nonstop-ai-agent-worker-bee\">A nonstop AI agent worker bee</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called “Frontier agents,” including one called “Kiro autonomous agent” that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live.

Lyft is using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-factory-for-the-private-data-center\">An AI Factory for the private data center</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced “AI Factories”</a> that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia’s tech and AWS’s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon’s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon’s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ojyZCM6qk?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Or as AWS puts it: Customers supply the power and the data center, and AWS plunks in the AI system, manages it, and can tie it into other AWS cloud services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea is to cater to companies and governments concerned with data sovereignty, or absolute control over their data so it can’t wind up in a competitor’s or foreign adversary’s hands. An on-prem AI Factory means not sending their data to a model maker and not even sharing the hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that product name sounds familiar, it should. That’s what Nvidia calls its hardware systems that are chock-full of tools needed to run AI, from its GPU chips to its networking tech. This AWS AI Factory is, in fact, a collaboration with Nvidia, <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/aws-partnership-expansion-reinvent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">both companies say</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this case, the AWS Factory will use a combination of AWS and Nvidia technology. Companies that deploy these systems can opt for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs or Amazon’s new Trainium3 chip. It uses AWS’ homegrown networking, storage, databases, and security and can tap into Amazon Bedrock — the AI model selection and management service, and AWS SageMaker AI, the model building and training tool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, AWS is far from the only giant cloud provider installing Nvidia AI Factories. In October, Microsoft showed off its first of many-to-come <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/while-openai-races-to-build-ai-data-centers-nadella-reminds-us-that-microsoft-already-has-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Factories rolling out into its global data centers</a> to run OpenAI workloads. Microsoft didn’t announce at the time that these extreme machines would be available for private clouds. Instead, Microsoft highlighted how it was leaning on a host of Nvidia AI Factory data center tech to build and connect its new “AI Superfactories,” aka new <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-microsoft-ai-superfactories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">state-of-the-art data centers being built in Wisconsin and Georgia.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/06/16/announcing-comprehensive-sovereign-solutions-empowering-european-organizations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Microsoft also outlined the data centers and cloud services</a> that would be built in local countries to address the data sovereignty issue. To be fair, its options also include “Azure Local,” Microsoft’s own managed hardware that could be installed on customer sites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, it is a bit ironic that AI is causing the biggest cloud providers to invest so heavily in corporate private data centers and hybrid clouds like it’s 2009 all over again.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During its 12 years as a private business, the one-time tech darling raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/21/eventbrite-is-reportedly-going-public-in-the-second-half-of-this-year/\">approximately $330 million</a> in venture capital from top investors such as Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike traditional private equity firms, Bending Spoons buys companies that it intends to hold forever, aiming to turn them profitable by cutting costs, raising prices, and introducing new product features. In October, Bending Spoons announced a massive $270 million funding round that valued the company at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/what-is-bending-spoons-everything-to-know-about-aols-acquirer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$11 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides Bending Spoons, other investors follow the strategy of acquiring, fixing, and holding stalled software firms, often referred to as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/why-hold-forever-investors-are-snapping-up-venture-capital-zombies/\">“venture zombie”</a> companies. These firms include Constellation Software, <a href=\"https://www.curiousholdings.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Curious</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/ZLRLCzq8n8Hwl0OycKsOC9mENB?domain=tiny.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tiny</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/P_YLCKAo6ofMgjZYckS6C5Qqog?domain=saas.group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SaaS.group</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/sFSTCA8LmLhlyvGPsQtyCGW8vh?domain=arisingventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Arising Ventures</a>, and <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/qTZzCB1MnMHRQgzks1u9C2N0yT?domain=calmcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Calm Capital</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, told TechCrunch that the firm buys “great companies” at low prices and quickly revives them to achieve <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/why-hold-forever-investors-are-snapping-up-venture-capital-zombies/\">20% to 30% profit margins</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Audited annual revenue was flat at about $325 million for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. Bending Spoons has agreed to pay approximately 1.7 times Eventbrite’s trailing 12 months’ revenue of $295 million. Despite this seemingly low revenue multiple, Eventbrite stockholders will receive $4.50 in cash per share, an 81% premium over the previous day’s $2.48 closing price.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

That means that users who are provided with the now common AI-generated snapshot of key information on a topic or question above their search results can choose to go deeper by asking follow-up questions in a conversational interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google calls this conversational feature <a href=\"https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Mode</a>. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-ai-mode-rolls-out-to-us-will-add-support-for-deeper-research-comparison-shopping-and-more/\">launched to U.S. users this May</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/googles-ai-mode-expands-globally-adds-new-agentic-features/\">to global users this August,</a> allowing for back-and-forth chats with Google’s Gemini AI, in an experience similar to ChatGPT.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more. You may have thought you were starting a simple query, only to find yourself delving deeper into the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new test, announced on Monday, Google says users will be able to “seamlessly go deeper” in AI Mode directly from the Search results page. While the test is rolling out to users globally, it’s only available on mobile devices for the time being. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rollout comes alongside a push inside Google’s AI rival, OpenAI, which is now delaying other products to focus on improving the chatbox experience. Thanks in part to the release of Gemini’s Nano Banana image model and other Gemini improvements, Gemini has grown <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to over 650 million monthly users</a> as of November. Merging the conversational mode with AI Overviews, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\">has 2 billion monthly users</a>, could give Gemini an edge in consumer adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notes VP of Product for Google Search Robby Stein, <a href=\"https://x.com/rmstein/status/1995572911093289055\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a post on X</a>, “You shouldn’t have to think about where or how to ask your question.” Instead, he explained, users will continue to get an AI Overview as a helpful starting point, but will then be able to ask conversational follow-up questions in AI Mode from the same screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This brings us closer to our vision for Search: just ask whatever’s on your mind – no matter how long or complex – and find exactly what you need,” Stein wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ojyZCM6qk?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Preview versions of the agents are available now.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called “Kiro autonomous agent” can work on its own for days at a time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kiro is a software coding agent based on AWS’s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced in July.</a> While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company’s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called “spec-driven development.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,” AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says Kiro maintains “persistent context across sessions.” In other words, it doesn’t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do.  It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garman described a task like updating a bit of critical code used by 15 bits of corporate software. Instead of assigning and verifying each update, Kiro can be assigned to fix all 15 in one prompt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To complete the automation of coding tasks, the cloud provider developed AWS Security Agent, an agent that works independently to identify security problems as code is written, tests it after the fact, and then offers suggested fixes. The DevOps Agent rounds out the trio, automatically testing the new code for performance issues, or compatibility with other software, hardware, or cloud settings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be sure, Amazon’s agents aren’t the first to claim long work windows. For instance OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-codex-max/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said last month </a>that GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, its agentic coding model, is designed for long runs, too, up to 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also not totally clear that the biggest hurdle to agentic adoption is the context window (aka the ability to work continuously without stalling out). LLMs still have hallucination and accuracy issues that turn developers into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">“babysitters,” they say.</a>  So developers often want to assign short tasks and verify quickly before moving on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, before agents can become like co-workers, context windows must grow bigger. Amazon’s tech is another big step in that direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ojyZCM6qk?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: Every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but also exceedingly important in this moment. There is also growing competition <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/what-is-substrate-a-thiel-backed-chip-startup-seeking-to-crack-asml-s-dominance?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">chasing after the same prize</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mina-fahmi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mina Fahmi</a>, who’s made a ring that captures your whispered thoughts and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">turns them into text</a>. Before you roll your eyes, know that he and co-founder Kirak Hong spent years at Meta working on this stuff after their company was acquired. The Stream Ring isn’t trying to be your friend — it’s trying to extend your brain. Backed by Toni Schneider, an operator who scaled WordPress in its earlier days, Sandbar just emerged from stealth and might well be onto something. (Schneider is a partner at True Ventures, whose other hardware bets have included Peloton, Ring, and Fitbit; he’s also coming to Palo Alto next week.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sciencecorporation_bringing-sight-to-the-blind-with-neural-engineering-activity-7292950930352726016-YI6a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Max Hodak</a> — Science Corp. founder, Time magazine <a href=\"https://time.com/7308925/elon-musk-memphis-ai-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cover subject</a>, and, earlier, Neuralink co-founder (along with Elon Musk) — who has already restored vision to dozens of blind people with retinal implants. Now he’s working on “biohybrid” brain-computer interfaces where chips seeded with stem cells grow into your brain tissue so paralyzed people can control devices with their thoughts. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, as Hodak views it. In fact, he thinks 2035 is going to look wildly different from today, and he’s happy to share how.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, we’re thrilled to welcome <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chchien\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chi-Hua Chien</a> of Goodwater Capital and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethweil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elizabeth Weil</a> of Scribble Ventures, two VCs who’ve backed Twitter, Spotify, TikTok, Slack, SpaceX, Figma, and Coinbase before they were household names. Chien runs Goodwater Capital; Weil founded Scribble Ventures after stints at Andreessen Horowitz and Twitter, made 100+ angel investments, and has a first fund showing 4x returns.
