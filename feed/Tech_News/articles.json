Then, parents can track the location of their child — or, at least their child’s shoes. These shoes don’t come with an AirTag, and they don’t appear to be an actual collaboration with Apple, but rather, a third-party product that Skechers has developed on its own. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shoes were announced in mid-July to little press, but <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/30/sketchers-lets-parents-hide-an-airtag-in-kids-shoes\">AppleInsider</a> reported on the product on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple only advertises its AirTags as products to keep track of items like keys, wallets, or luggage — not human beings. But parents have been using the technology to keep an eye on their kids. Already, there are products like AirTag-compatible bracelets, insoles, pins, or even knock-off Crocs Jibbitz that can fit an AirTag. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps intentionally, AirTags are not designed to be very good at tracking fast-moving things, like a kid on a school bus, for example. Unlike an iPhone with location sharing enabled, AirTags don’t have built-in GPS. Instead, they use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/first-findings-with-apples-new-airtag-location-devices/\">Bluetooth beaconing technology</a> to quietly signal their presence to nearby Apple devices, giving the owner of the AirTag an estimate of its location.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This technology can still be used for nefarious purposes, however. Bad actors have hidden AirTags in people’s bags or cars to stalk them, which sparked <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/suggested-article-title-airtag-stalking-class-action-survives-motion-to-dismiss\">a class action lawsuit</a>. Apple has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/13/apple-and-google-agree-on-standard-to-alert-people-when-unknown-bluetooth-devices-may-be-tracking-them/\">instituted</a> some anti-stalking features, such as notifying someone via their iPhone or Apple Watch when an unfamiliar AirTag is traveling with them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since Skechers only makes this product in kids’ sizes, it’s unlikely that these shoes could be used to surveil adults against their will — but the continued normalization of this kind of surveillance could have implications beyond childcare. It’s possible that Skechers or another shoe brand could make similar products designed for adults with conditions like dementia, who may unintentionally wander away from their caretakers. While those uses may be well-intentioned, these kinds of products could also be used to track adults without their consent.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-powered marketing automation startup Conversion, founded five years ago by two UC Berkeley dropouts, has raised a $28 million Series A led by Abstract, with participation from True Ventures and HOF Capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s founding story sounds like it could have been an episode of the HBO show “Silicon Valley.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The story begins all the way back when co-founder and CEO Neil Tewari, now 24, was in high school. He got busted one day watching a TechCrunch Disrupt livestream during class, was sent to the principal’s office and had to stay late.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Afraid to call his parents and tell them why they had to pick him up, he instead called one of their close friends. On the drive home, Tewari explained to the friend what got him in trouble. “I told him I had this interest [in entrepreneurship], and four years later, he was actually the first person to write us a check into the company,” Tewari told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">James Jiao, Tewari’s college roommate at Berkeley — now Conversion’s co-founder and CTO — also dreamed of founding his own company, so the two tried building various products, like one for helping marketeers buy product placement ads. They stumbled on the idea for Conversion when they signed up for HubSpot to help them with marketing tasks and decided to build a few extra automation features to layer on top of it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was originally for us,” Tewari said of his startup’s tech. The co-founders enjoyed building their internal marketing tool so much, they wondered if they could sell it and began reaching out to marketing executives for “customer discovery” interviews.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We actually spent like two months doing like 160 customer interviews with VPs of marketing, 50- to 500-employee businesses, and got a much more positive response than we could have imagined,” Tewari said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marketing teams had these tools deeply embedded in their workflows, but everyone had similar complaints about the parts they couldn’t automate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The duo had found their idea. The family friend introduced them to more marketing execs, which helped them raise a $2 million seed round. At age 19, they dropped out of college to work full time on Conversion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders treated their raised funds so frugally, they lived in a two-bed, one-bath apartment with five other roommates: two people to a room, with people sleeping on the couches and in the closet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As they built their product, ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Many legacy marketing automation tools are adding various AI and chat integrations into their wares, but not all of their features support these integrations. Marketing teams wanted “to be able to enrich contacts, [be] able to automate workflows,” for instance, Tewari said. Conversion has baked AI in, which means it can do things like organize leads and automate personalized follow-up emails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI interest has soared, so has the company’s prospects. Conversion is nearing $10 million ARR over the past two years, Tewari said, and about 90% of its customers are midsize businesses that have yanked out a legacy app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, Conversion is also in a crowded field. Besides the legacy marketing automation tools like HubSpot, Adobe Marketo, or Salesforce Pardot, there are other AI native startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/ai-content-platform-jasper-raises-125m-at-a-1-7b-valuation/\">Jasper</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/generative-ai-startup-writer-raises-200m-at-a-1-9b-valuation/\">Writer AI</a>, Iterable, Copy.ai, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://a16z.com/ai-marketer-how-gen-ai-based-software-is-advancing-marketing-and-sales/\">and many</a> others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Tewari also has the classic Silicon Valley confidence of a founder in a crowded market. His game plan calls for targeting businesses that use the older marketing tools. Conversion is not, for instance, targeting startups choosing a tool for the first time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised a total of $30 million between its seed and Series A, the CEO says, and is doing well enough that the founders have each moved into separate apartments where they have their own rooms, and none of their roommates sleep in a closet.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Since its first cargo eVTOL delivery in late 2023, the company has secured over 2,500 pre-orders for its piloted personal aircraft, AIR ONE, and plans to ship 15 cargo eVTOLs this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To build on that momentum, AIR recently raised $23 million in a Series A funding round led by Entree Capital, with participation from existing backer Dr. Shmuel Harlap, an early investor in Mobileye. The new capital will be used to scale its production facility in Israel, hire additional employees, and support the company’s expansion to the U.S., CEO and co-founder Rani Plaut told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series A funding comes in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/president-trump-signs-executive-orders-on-drones-flying-cars-and-supersonics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a recent U.S. Executive Order</a> promoting domestic drone and eVTOL development, as well as <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-announces-improvements-recreational-aviation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an update to the FAA’s MOSAIC rule</a> that expands certification pathways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s cargo aircraft currently in operation do not require full Type Certification and are flown under <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/aw_cert/special_aw_certificates\">Experimental Airworthiness Certificates</a> (EAC) for logistics and dual-use missions, according to Plaut. EACs are issued to aircraft that are in development, testing, or for research purposes. They allow the aircraft to fly under strict conditions and limitations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our launch customer is flying under an Experimental Airworthiness Certificate, which will convert to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.interconnect-wiring.com/aerospace/what-is-a-type-certificate/\">a “Type” certificate </a>once the uncrewed eVTOL completes the certification process,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Type certification means an aircraft meets all applicable safety and regulatory standards, and can be produced and operated commercially. EACs don’t “convert” automatically to Type certificates; AIR likely will use its EAC to test its prototype while working through the Type certification process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, AIR expects the two-seated, piloted AIR ONE to qualify for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/gen_av/light_sport\">Light Sport Aircraft (LSA)</a> certification under the new MOSAIC rules. Aircraft certified as LSA are limited to flying outside densely populated areas and away from controlled airspace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We designed the AIR ONE from day one to align with the MOSAIC LSA criteria, anticipating a more streamlined certification pathway,” Plaut added. “Now that the rule is finalized, we’re on track to become the first piloted eVTOL certified under LSA to reach private customers. Our goal is to begin deliveries as soon as the rule becomes enforceable in 2026.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. is a great market for eVTOL companies today, given the opportunity to land enterprise and government contracts, especially as the Trump administration adopts an increasingly hawkish defense stance. But AIR will face intense competition: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/joby-aviation-and-virgin-atlantic-partner-to-launch-electric-air-taxis-in-the-uk/\">Joby Aviation</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/archers-vision-of-an-air-taxi-network-could-benefit-from-southwest-customer-data/\">Archer Aviation</a> already have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/11/joby-delta-air-lines-to-pilot-home-to-airport-evtol-transportation/\">partnerships with airlines</a> to bring their air taxi services to life; and along with Beta Technologies, they already have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/archer-aviation-doubles-down-on-defense-aircraft-with-fresh-300m/\">military contracts</a> for testing their aircrafts’ recon and logistics abilities. On top of that, AIR isn’t manufacturing its eVTOLs in the U.S. yet, which is table stakes for winning government contracts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, AIR says its design architecture and cost control give it an edge against the incumbents. It hopes its current funding round will help it with its planned U.S.-based manufacturing hub for high-volume production.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What sets AIR apart is the shared design DNA between both aircraft variants,” Plaut said. This unified architecture allows for cross-platform upgrades, meaning advancements in one model can be applied to the other, streamlining development, manufacturing, and scalability, he explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The size and folding-wing mechanism solve a major infrastructure hurdle,” Plaut explained. “They don’t require airports or complex handling — just a flat surface — and can park in most garages or driveways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AIR’s uncrewed model also follows simplified SOPs (standard operating procedures), which, the CEO says, allows even minimally trained ground crews to operate it. “And we’re closing the cost gap by applying automotive-grade manufacturing principles for scalable production,” he added.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Companies started pushing out new versions of their software more frequently — and producing significantly more data because of it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Observe is responding to the latest big shift in technology: AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">San Mateo-based Observe helps companies get an inside look at the status of their software, which makes it easier for engineers to spot and solve disruptions and outages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recent advancements in AI are both a blessing and a burden for the company. Observe’s observability product incorporates AI agents to help make finding and fixing issues faster for its customers. But advancements in AI mean companies are shipping software even faster than before and seeing their data balloon because of it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO Jeremy Burton told TechCrunch that with the continual advancement of AI agents, observability continues to get more complex.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In a few years, you’re going to have hundreds or thousands of agents on your network that are all interacting with employees or interacting with each other,” Burton said. “That’s all great until something goes wrong, and you’ve got to try and, you know, do a Sherlock Holmes and figure out who done it, you know?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Observe is adapting to how the industry is changing, Burton said. The company released a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server earlier this year that allows developers to access their observability data from AI coding tools and LLMs. This is to help meet developers where they are already working, Burton said, and help them accomplish tasks easier.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have customers already that are using the MCP server and really trying fairly radical workflows,” Burton said. “They’re sitting in their development environment, and they say, ‘Hey, take a look at this ticket. Use Observe to go figure out what’s happening, and then describe to me the code that you think is problematic, and then suggest the effects.’ That would have been in the realm of science fiction even a year ago.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also working toward supporting Apache Iceberg, an open source data table format that allows businesses to own and standardize their own data. Burton said companies really like that approach, and Observe expects to be able to support that format by the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s revenue nearly tripled in 2024, and it saw 93% gross retention of its customers, although Burton declined to share specific numbers.

Companies likely to be affected by these rules include major names such as Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI, as well as several other large generative models, and they will have two years to comply fully with the AI Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/eu-ai-code-practice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> on Wednesday, Kent Walker, president of global affairs at Google, conceded that the final version of the code of practice was better than what the EU proposed initially, but he still noted reservations around the AI Act and the code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing Europe’s development and deployment of AI. In particular, departures from EU copyright law, steps that slow approvals, or requirements that expose trade secrets could chill European model development and deployment, harming Europe’s competitiveness,” wrote Walker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By signing the EU’s <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">code of practice</a>, AI companies would agree to follow a slate of guidelines, which include providing updated documentation about their AI tools and services; no training AI on pirated content; and complying with requests from content owners to not use their works in their datasets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/eu-council-gives-final-nod-to-set-up-risk-based-regulations-for-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">risk-based regulation</a> for AI applications, the EU’s landmark AI Act bans some “unacceptable risk” use cases, such as cognitive behavioral manipulation or social scoring. The rules also define a set of “high-risk” uses, including biometrics and facial recognition, and the use of AI in domains like education and employment. The act also requires developers to register AI systems and meet risk- and quality-management obligations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The technology will initially roll out to U.S. users as a pilot program, allowing contributors to both write and rate Footnotes on TikTok videos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All U.S. TikTok users are able to view the notes that have been rated as helpful and submit their own ratings in return.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/tiktok-begins-testing-footnotes-a-new-community-notes-like-feature/\">announced its plans to test Footnotes</a> in April. At the time, it described the feature as a way to give the community more context around TikTok’s content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like X’s Community Notes and other, similar programs, TikTok uses a bridging algorithm that tries to find consensus among people who typically have different views. If both sides rate a note as helpful, then it’s more likely to be true, according to this method. This also guards against brigading, where one side tries to sway a decision their way by voting similarly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says notes can help people better understand what they’re seeing on the platform by adding more information and context. Sometimes the person who posted the video that gets a note is actively trying to misrepresent a situation, while other times they may have simply missed other information or updates that could be helpful for viewers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3032119\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg 5832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=300,94 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=768,240 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=680,212 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=1200,374 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=1280,399 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=430,134 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=720,225 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=900,281 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=800,250 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=1536,479 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=2048,639 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=668,208 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=1440,449 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=708,221 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/combined_side_by_side.jpg?resize=50,16 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 5832px) 100vw, 5832px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TikTok</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok began allowing U.S. users to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/falcon/communitysafety/page/footnotes/index.html?container_color_auto_dark=1&amp;hide_nav_bar=1&amp;should_full_screen=1&amp;use_spark=1&amp;enter_from=blog_post_link\">apply</a> to be a contributor back in April, as long as they were at least 18, had been on TikTok for more than six months, and had no recent history of violating TikTok’s Community Standards.

The Space Force has already awarded contracts to defense primes Boeing and Northrop Grumman to develop prototype payloads for satellites heading to far-away geostationary orbit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the program is entering a new phase. On Tuesday, the Space Force awarded five additional contracts for the design and demonstration of purpose-built satellites to provide jam-resistant comms to tactical forces. The winners include previous winners Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Viasat, and Intelsat, plus a relative newcomer: Astranis, a venture-backed startup based in San Francisco. (Intelsat will buy its satellite bus from K2 Space, another venture-backed startup.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The initial awards are relatively small, totaling $37.3 million combined. But the program has a $4 billion award ceiling, so the winners could sign on to a much more lucrative defense deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each firm will develop its architectures through January 2026. After that, the Space Force will select one design and award an additional contract for the first satellite, with a launch planned in 2028. Additional production awards will be doled out, also in 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The PTS-G contracts are a notable departure from how the military has historically procured geostationary satellites, which have typically had extremely long timelines from contract award to launch, and would cost hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars per spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In contrast, the Space Force is clearly trying to leverage the speed of commercial entrants and encourage competition by selecting multiple vendors for the initial phase of the program.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our PTS-G contract transforms how SSC acquires SATCOM capability for the warfighter,” program executive officer Cordell DeLaPena Jr. said in a news release. “The incorporation of commercial baseline designs to meet military capability significantly enhances the Space Force’s speed and efficiency to add capability to meet emerging threats.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But one U.S. senator wants to know if other tech giants, like Google, have also received secret backdoor demands from the U.K. government. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google refused to answer the lawmaker’s questions but has since told TechCrunch that the technology giant has not received a backdoor demand, marking the first time that Google has confirmed it is not subject to a similar U.K. order.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, The Washington Post reported that the U.K. Home Office <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sought a secret court order in the U.K.’s surveillance court</a> demanding that Apple allow U.K. authorities to access the end-to-end encrypted cloud data stored on any customer in the world, including their iPhone and iPad backups. Apple encrypts the data in such a way that only customers, and not Apple, can access their data stored on its servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under U.K. law, tech companies subject to secret surveillance court orders, such as Apple, are legally barred from revealing details of an order, or the existence of the order itself, despite <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">details of the demand publicly leaking earlier this year</a>. Critics called the secret order against Apple “draconian,” saying it would have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/uks-secret-apple-icloud-backdoor-order-is-a-global-emergency-say-critics/\">global ramifications for users’ privacy</a>. Apple has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/apple-is-challenging-u-k-s-icloud-encryption-backdoor-order/\">since appealed the legality of the order</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26035106-wyden-dni-google-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a new letter</a> sent to top U.S. intelligence official Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday, Sen. Ron Wyden, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that while tech companies cannot say whether they have received a U.K. order, at least one technology giant has confirmed that it hasn’t received one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta, which uses end-to-end encryption to protect user messages sent between WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, told Wyden’s office on March 17 that the company has “not received an order to backdoor our encrypted services, like that reported about Apple.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, for its part, would not tell Wyden’s office if it had received a U.K. government order for accessing encrypted data, such as Android backups, “only stating that if it had received a technical capabilities notice, it would be prohibited from disclosing that fact,” said Wyden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google spokesperson Karl Ryan told TechCrunch in a statement: “We have never built any mechanism or ‘backdoor’ to circumvent end-to-end encryption in our products. If we say a product is end-to-end encrypted, it is.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When explicitly asked by TechCrunch, Ryan said: “We haven’t received a technical capabilities notice,” referring to any U.K. surveillance order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wyden’s letter, first reported by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/29/uk-encryption-backdoor-wyden-letter-gabbard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26035106-wyden-dni-google-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared with TechCrunch</a>, called on Gabbard to make public its “assessment of the national security risks posed by the U.K.’s surveillance laws and its reported secret demands of U.S. companies.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated with additional comment from Google, shared in response to a TechCrunch inquiry.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

First <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-notebooklm-is-getting-video-overviews/\">introduced at Google I/O</a> in May, Video Overviews allow users to turn dense multimedia, such as raw notes, PDFs, and images, into digestible visual presentations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, the service took an audio approach to helping users understand materials with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/googles-notebooklm-expands-its-ai-podcast-feature-to-more-languages/\">Audio Overviews</a>, a feature that gives users the ability to generate a podcast with AI virtual hosts based on documents they have shared with NotebookLM, such as course readings or legal briefs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this new capability, NotebookLM is taking a more visual approach to helping users understand different topics and ideas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says users can think of Video Overviews as a visual alternative to Audio Overviews. The feature creates new visuals while pulling in images, diagrams, quotes, and numbers from uploaded documents to explain the content. Google says the feature is good for explaining data, demonstrating processes, and making abstract concepts easier to understand. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3032032\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png 2244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=1200,673 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=1280,718 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=720,404 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=900,505 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=800,448 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=1536,861 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=2048,1148 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=1101,617 1101w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=708,397 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can customize their Video Overviews, just as they do with Audio Overviews. They can specify topics to focus on, indicate their learning goals, describe the target audience, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They can ask simple questions like, “I know nothing about this topic; help me understand the diagrams in the paper,” or specific ones like, “I’m already an expert on X and my team works on Y; focus on Z.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Video Overviews are now rolling out to all users in English, with support for more languages coming soon, Google says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google also announced that it’s rolling out updates to NotebookLM’s Studio panel. Users can now create and store multiple studio outputs of the same type in a single notebook. Plus, users will now see four tiles at the top of the Studio panel for creating Audio Overviews, Video Overviews, Mind Maps, and Reports with a single click. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, users can now multitask within the Studio panel. For example, they can listen to an Audio Overview while simultaneously exploring a Mind Map or reviewing a Study Guide.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company expects to introduce Study Mode to its Edu subscribers, which largely consists of young people whose school administrator’s have purchased a plan for the entire student body, in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Study Mode is OpenAI’s attempt to address <a href=\"https://campustechnology.com/articles/2024/08/28/survey-86-of-students-already-use-ai-in-their-studies.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the millions of students who use ChatGPT in school</a>. Studies have shown that using <a href=\"https://nssa.stanford.edu/news/study-ai-assisted-tutoring-boosts-students-math-skills#:~:text=In%20all%2C%20about%201%2C000%20students,didn't%20work%20with%20AI.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT can be a helpful tutor </a>for young people, but it also <a href=\"https://www.psypost.org/study-finds-chatgpt-eases-students-cognitive-load-but-at-the-expense-of-critical-thinking/#google_vignette\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">may harm their critical thinking skills.</a> A research paper released in June found that <a href=\"https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">people who use ChatGPT to write essays exhibit lower brain activity during the process</a> compared to those who use Google Search or nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When ChatGPT first launched in 2022, its widespread use in school settings sparked fear among educators, leading to generative AI bans in many American school districts. By 2023, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/business/schools-chatgpt-chatbot-bans.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some of those schools repealed their ChatGPT bans</a>, and teachers around the country came to terms with the fact that ChatGPT would be a part of young people’s lives from now on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now with the launch of Study Mode, OpenAI hopes to improve ChatGPT as a learning tool, and not just an answer engine. Anthropic launched a similar tool for its AI chatbot Claude, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/anthropic-launches-an-ai-chatbot-tier-for-colleges-and-universities/\">called Learning Mode</a>, in April.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, there are limitations to how effective Study Mode truly is. Students can easily switch into the regular mode of ChatGPT if they just want an answer to a question. OpenAI’s VP of Education, Leah Belsky, told TechCrunch in a briefing that the company is not offering tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. However, Belsky said OpenAI may explore administrative or parental controls in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means it will take a committed student to use Study Mode — the kids have to really want to learn, not just finish their assignment.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says Study Mode is the company’s first step to improving learning in ChatGPT and aims to publish more information in the future about how students use generative AI throughout their education.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, Spotify is teasing that generative AI advances may pave the way for an even more conversational interface with the streaming service in the future, according to comments made during Spotify’s second-quarter earnings call with investors on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked about how AI was affecting its business, Spotify Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström noted that consumers today are able to talk to Spotify in plain English to request music, allowing the company to associate which phrases connect with which songs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can think of it as us getting a new dataset,” he said. “Spotify’s got this unique dataset from all of its playlists, which was really song-to-song — like which song goes well with another song, kind of the Amazon ‘people who bought this also bought that,’” he said. Meanwhile, the voice interface is delivering new insights to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And that’s completely new to us, and it’s a very, very valuable dataset that we are collecting very quickly,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, the exec says we can expect Spotify’s consumer experiences to get “much more interactive.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can already write to Spotify, talk to Spotify. You’re just going to see that expand,” Söderström said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, AI technology would allow Spotify to do more than just predict what someone might want to listen to, whether music, podcasts, or audiobooks, as it does today. Instead of only making predictions, it would be able to “reason” over the user’s listening history and what they said to the AI DJ. The reference to reasoning suggests that Spotify is looking toward AI reasoning models that can perform more complex tasks across multiple steps.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The voice data in question comes from Spotify’s AI DJ feature. In May 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/spotifys-ai-dj-now-lets-you-use-voice-commands-to-personalize-your-tunes/\">Spotify introduced a way</a> for Premium subscribers to make voice requests to the English-language AI DJ by pressing a button in the app. This lets users change the music, the genre, or the mood of a playlist using a voice command.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Consumer features aren’t the only way Spotify is leveraging AI. During the call, the exec also mentioned that Spotify is using generative AI internally to more rapidly prototype products and create efficiencies in other areas of its business, like finance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the quarter, Spotify <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/spotify-q2-2025-earnings-subscribers-profit-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hit 276 million paying subscribers</a>, up 12% year-over-year, and 696 million monthly active users, but swung to a loss after missing revenue targets.
