The company is also allowing free users to access the assistant’s features, such as summarizing the meetings, listing action items, or getting insights from meetings with limits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that basic plan users get to use the AI companion within three meetings every month, which will each include a meeting summary, in-meeting questions, and AI note-taking capabilities. Plus, they can ask 20 questions each through the side panel and the new web surface. They can also purchase a $10 add-on plan to access AI companion features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the new web surface, the company is also adding conversation starter prompts to inform users about what the assistant can do. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoom said that with this update, the assistant can also retrieve information from third-party services such as Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, along with all data stored within Zoom. The company said it will soon add support for Gmail and Microsoft Outlook as connectors.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075917\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=1200,853 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=1280,910 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=430,306 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=720,512 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=900,640 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=800,569 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=668,475 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=527,375 527w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=868,617 868w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=708,503 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Agentic-retrival.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Zoom</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Companion also generates a daily reflection report that summarizes meetings, tasks, and updates for the day.

Discovery (WBD) for $82.7 billion. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/how-would-the-netflix-warner-bros-deal-reshape-hollywood/\">Responses from the industry</a> have been generally negative, sparking concern about the acquisition’s implications for jobs, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have sought to address fears surrounding the deal in a letter to employees, which was made public by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-15/netflix-ceos-make-their-case-for-warner-bros-acquisition\">Bloomberg</a> on Monday. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The executives reassured staff of their commitment to maintaining theatrical releases for WBD films. They also asserted that there will be “no overlap or studio closures.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The co-CEOs further stated that the “deal is about growth” and that the company is “strengthening one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite these assurances, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wgaeast.org/wga-statement-on-the-acquisition-of-warner-bros-discovery-by-netflix/\">the Writers Guild of America (WGA)</a> has emerged as a vocal opponent of the acquisition, arguing that it violates antitrust laws designed to prevent monopolies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the deal has attracted the attention of lawmakers. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sen-elizabeth-warren-letter-doj-wbd-sale-paramount-1236430180/\">submitted a letter</a> to the Justice Department Antitrust Division expressing their concerns about the potential implications of a massive merger in the entertainment industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The senators argue that, in addition to raising ethical questions, the newly merged media giant would possess “more market power than the current companies to raise consumers’ television costs,” especially at a time when middle-class families are already facing rising prices. Notably, Netflix raised its subscription prices last January.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To counter monopoly concerns, Peters and Sarandos cited Nielsen data in their letter reportedly showing that combining Netflix and WBD would result in a smaller viewership share than YouTube currently holds, or what a competing Paramount-WBD merger would create.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter comes on the heels of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\">Paramount </a>making a competing $108.4 billion offer to acquire WBD, signaling that the competition for media dominance is far from over. Paramount was previously viewed as the main contender; however, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/paramount-skydance-hostile-bid-wbd-netflix.html\">CNBC</a> reported that WBD’s board rejected the terms of the offer.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to Meta’s help <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/www/148968815185634/\">documentation</a>, Messenger for Mac was built with Catalyst, which lets developers bring iPad apps to the Mac. That technology has received criticism for both developers and users — developers cited the extra work required, while users noticed apps’ lack of a native feel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before its Catalyst version, the Mac app was an Electron app that later migrated to a React Native Desktop app, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.threads.com/@danielbuechele\">according</a> to a former Meta software engineer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Windows, the app <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1fqaxtp/the_facebook_messenger_app_on_ms_store_has_been/\">transitioned</a> to a progressive web app last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The downgrades likely impacted user demand for a standalone Mac app, while the strategy of moving Messenger back to Facebook suggested Meta was attempting to shore up declining usage of its aging flagship social network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This fall, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/meta-to-shut-down-messenger-desktop-apps-for-mac-and-windows/\">warned users that Messenger’s desktop</a> app would be deprecated by year end, and encouraged users to set up a PIN to save their chat history before moving to the web.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People who use Messenger without a Facebook account are being redirected to Messenger.com after the shutdown, where they’ll be able to log in without creating a Facebook account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More information for users about the transition is available on Facebook’s help center, with separate sections for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1789649698300122?helpref=faq_content\">Mac users</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1789649698300122?helpref=faq_content\">Windows users</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now he is on the precipice of launching a service meant to compete with Waymo, the Alphabet-owned company that he said last week “never really had a chance against Tesla.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The removal of the safety monitors will most likely ramp up the scrutiny on Tesla’s ongoing testing in Austin, doubly so when the company starts offering rides in the empty cars. Tesla’s small test fleet has been involved in at least seven crashes since June; few details are known about the accidents since the company <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/11/17/tesla-robotaxi-had-3-more-crashes-now-7-total/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">aggressively redacts</a> its reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Video of a totally empty Tesla Model Y SUV started spreading on social media over the weekend, and on Sunday, Musk confirmed his company was <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2000302654837371181\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">testing</a> “with no occupants.” Neither Musk nor Tesla has shared how quickly it plans to move to offer customer rides with no safety monitor. The company’s own X account provided a hint in a post Sunday evening: “Slowly, then all at once.” Tesla’s head of AI, Ashok Elluswamy, <a href=\"https://x.com/aelluswamy/status/2000249076567404593\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>: “And so it begins!”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/22/tesla-launches-robotaxi-rides-in-austin-with-big-promises-and-unanswered-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">started offering rides</a> in Austin to hand-picked influencers and customers in June, with an employee in the passenger seat who could take over if the cars did anything unsafe. Those safety monitors moved to the <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/09/03/tesla-moves-robotaxi-safety-monitor-passenger-drivers-seat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">driver’s seat in September</a>. The company has since ditched the wait list, and gradually expanded its service area to cover a large portion of the greater Austin metropolitan area. But its fleet size never grew to more than about 25 to 30 cars by most fans’ counts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk has claimed Tesla will operate its own fleet of Robotaxis, and said in July he <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/07/23/elon-musk-with-straight-face-tesla-robotaxi-will-cover-half-us-population-end-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">believed this fleet</a> would cover “half of the population of the U.S.” by the end of this year. That outrageous target, like so many Musk has set over the years, has been revised down to him claiming in November that Tesla would roughly double its existing Austin fleet, or <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/11/26/elon-musk-slashes-tesla-robotaxi-fleet-goal-austin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">around 60 vehicles</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has been testing a ride-hail service in the San Francisco area for the last few months, in which drivers use the company’s advanced driver assistance software. California has regulations in place that mean Tesla will need to combine multiple permits if it wants to offer fully driverless rides in the state. Texas, on the other hand, does not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk has also talked a lot over the years about allowing Tesla owners to add their personal cars to the company’s robotaxi fleet. In 2016, he even promised that every car Tesla made had all the hardware required to eventually become autonomous. That was wrong, and that blog post has since been removed from Tesla’s website (the company faces a number of legal challenges over it). Tesla has gone through multiple versions of the hardware that powers its driver assistance software, meaning there are millions of cars on the road that, by Musk’s own admission in January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/elon-musk-reveals-elon-musk-was-wrong-about-full-self-driving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">will need to be upgraded</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

There, they will see a “Your 2025 Snap Recap” card.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as companies like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Duolingo have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/spotify-wrapped-2024-is-almost-here-its-time-to-explore-all-the-copycats/\">all released their own end-of-year recaps</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the Recaps, Snapchat shared statistics on how people used the social media app over the past year. For example, the company says phone calls aren’t dead, noting that users talked for nearly 1.7 billion minutes per day on average, almost 30% more than last year. Plus, users in the U.S. sent over five billion voice notes, nearly 10% more than last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Group chats still remain a popular way to connect on Snapchat, as the number of people sending messages to group chats grew by more than 5% in 2025, and some users sent more than 8,880 messages to their top group chat this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also revealed that Chat Reactions grew by 44% this year, with the heart emoji taking the crown as the most popular. Additionally, three million more people also used stickers to communicate this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch of Snap’s 2025 Recap arrives amid user backlash over the company’s plans to charge for storage next year, with <a href=\"https://x.com/Jude8Mills/status/1973699845736272366\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some calling</a> for a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@averykatherinewood/video/7583384295172099342\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">boycott</a> to urge the company to change its mind. Snapchat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/snapchat-caps-free-memory-storage-launches-paid-storage-plans/\">announced</a> in September that free access to Memories will be limited to 5GB. If a user’s memories exceed this limit, they’ll need to subscribe to one of the service’s new Memories Storage plans.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The introductory storage plan offers up to 100GB of storage for $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ users will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their $3.99 monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB as part of their $15.99 monthly subscription.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The two-year-old German startup has raised a $41 million seed round led by Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch learned exclusively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new capital will help Mirelo compete more effectively in its emerging category. While it was still in stealth mode and resource-constrained, large companies such as Sony and Tencent released video-to-SFX models. So did Kuaishou-owned Kling AI, out of China, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-to-add-sound-effects-to-your-video-with-elevenlabs-video-to-sound-generator\">ElevenLabs</a>, which is also backed by a16z.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Mirelo already differs from them by its narrower focus, beating these models in the long run requires the startup to make additional hires. Altogether, the startup expects its team of 10 people to “double if not triple” in headcount by the end of next year, Mirelo CEO and co-founder CJ Simon-Gabriel told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These new hires will support Mirelo’s R&amp;D, as well as its product and go-to-market strategy. The startup published its models on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/fal-nabs-140m-in-fresh-funding-led-by-sequoia-tripling-valuation-to-4-5b/\">Fal.ai</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/replicate_video-to-sfx-from-our-friends-at-mirelo-activity-7374517162570387456-YWJu\">Replicate</a>, and expects API usage to drive most of its revenue in the short term, Simon-Gabriel said. But it is also investing in building out its workspace for creators, Mirelo Studio, which could eventually support full professional use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Mirelo prepares to scale, the startup and its investors are also anticipating concerns around training data that have dogged other generative AI companies. According to Georgia Stevenson, who led Index’s investments, Mirelo based its models on public and purchased sound libraries, and is signing revenue-sharing partnerships that respect artists’ rights. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a tension inherent to generative AI tools, but Mirelo isn’t displacing musicians and sound designers — at least not yet. With a freemium model including a recommended plan for creators priced at €20/month (approximately $23.50), the startup is mostly targeting amateurs and prosumers hoping to unmute AI-generated videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Simon-Gabriel, creators can’t fully benefit from this new potential without audio. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“George Lucas said that sound is 50% of the movie-going experience. It’s not an overstatement,” he said. “If anything, it’s an understatement. You can take exactly the same images, and the sound will shape a completely different ambience, depending on the sound and the music that you put in there.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He and his co-founder, Florian Wenzel, are both AI researchers and musicians themselves, and the startup has AI music generation on its roadmap. But Mirelo is seeing more pull for sound effects, in part because there is less research happening than in other AI fields, Simon-Gabriel said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s easier to build a real moat here, and then to capitalize on it,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This could pay off for Mirelo. Simon-Gabriel declined to disclose its new valuation, but said it had increased “very significantly” compared to its previously undisclosed pre-seed round. That earlier round was led by Berlin-based firm Atlantic, which also participated in the new funding, bringing Mirelo’s total raised to $44 million and helping close its resource gap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also backed by angels who lend credibility to its technology and could open new doors, including Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch, Hugging Face chief science officer Thomas Wolf, Fal.ai co-founder Burkay Gur, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the team is aware that AI-generated videos may not be mute for long. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Gemini’s video generator now incorporates soundtracks powered by DeepMind’s Veo 3.1 video-to-audio model. But if anything, Simon-Gabriel sounds vindicated. “Now, suddenly, people realize, ‘Oh, maybe we should add sound.’ But, of course, you should add some. It’s a bit like silent movies versus talkies, right? It does make quite a difference!”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By building a power plant first and ironing out the kinks in software, Thea could help bring the cost of fusion power down dramatically.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Thea-Energy-Helios-Maintainability.gif?w=680\" alt=\"An animation shows how Thea Energy's Helios reactor will be maintained.\" class=\"wp-image-3075722\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">This animation shows how Helios can be disassembled for maintenance.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Thea Energy</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But first the company has to build a working prototype. Today, Thea is publishing the details of its design, including the details of the physics that underpin it. The startup shared the paper exclusively with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thea is building a unique take on the stellarator, a specific type of reactor that uses magnets to whip the plasma fuel into shape. Magnets are one of the two main ways that fusion scientists keep plasma heat and confine plasma until fusion reactions occur. The other, known as inertial confinement, uses lasers or some other force to squeeze small fuel pellets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most stellarators are built with magnets that look at home in a Salvador Dali painting. But Thea’s design uses a dozen larger magnets and hundreds of smaller ones to create what you might call a “virtual” stellarator.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a typical stellarator, the magnets are built to follow the contours of a shape that’s intended to work with the quirks of plasma, helping to confine it for longer using less power than tokamaks, which use a series of identically sized and shaped magnets. Yet stellarators have one major disadvantage: the irregular shape makes mass manufacturing magnets challenging.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So instead, Thea designed its reactor around small, identical superconducting magnets that are arranged in arrays. The startup will use software to control each magnet individually to generate magnetic fields that can replicate a stellarator’s wobbly shape.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Thea-Energy-Planar-Coil-Stellarator.gif?w=680\" alt=\"An animation of plasma flowing through Thea Energy's Helios reactor core.\" class=\"wp-image-3075723\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A cutaway view of plasma flowing through Helios’s reactor core.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Thea Energy</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The approach has several upsides. For one, it has allowed Thea to rapidly iterate on its magnet design. In the last two years, the company has tweaked the design more than 60 times, Berzin said. “Most fusion companies, you’re dealing with magnets that are the size of a car or a laser the size of a car or a widget the size of car. That unfortunately means one is $20 million and takes two years [to make],” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has also meant the company can use software controls to overcome any irregularities in the way the magnets were made or installed. To test its original control system, Thea built a three-by-three array of its magnets laced with sensors. The controls, which were derived from the physics of electromagnetism, worked well. But the company also wanted to see how AI might handle the task, so it also trained a new one using reinforced learning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team came away surprised at how well it all worked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We purposefully threw curveballs at the array,” Berzin said. “We purposefully dismounted a magnet by literally over a centimeter. You could see it was super out of line. It was really hard for us to actually manufacture it so poorly.” The team also tested superconducting material from five different manufacturers along with intentionally defective material. “Every single time we did that, the control system, without us turning knobs and intervening, was able to tune out those defects,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thea’s reactor design, Helios, will use two types of magnets. One the outside, 12 large magnets of four different shapes will do the heavy lifting to keep the plasma confined. They’re similar to those found on a tokamak, the type of doughnut-shaped reactor that competitor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</a> is building. Inside the large coils, 324 smaller circular magnets will fine tune the shape of the plasma.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup predicts Helios will generate 1.1 gigawatts of heat, which a steam turbine will turn into 390 megawatts of electricity at a cost below $150 per megawatt-hour. The reactor will have to shut down for an 84-day maintenance period once every two years. If all goes well, that means its capacity factor — a measure of how much power it generates over a given period of time — will be 88%. That’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nuclear-power-most-reliable-energy-source-and-its-not-even-close\">far better</a> than today’s gas-fired power plants and almost as good as today’s nuclear power plants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helios is still in the conceptual phase. Thea first has to build Eos, its initial fusion device that’s intended to prove the science behind the concept. Berzin said the company will announce a site for Eos in 2026 with plans to turn it on “around 2030.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it builds Eos, Thea plans to start work in parallel on Helios. It’s a similar approach to how Commonwealth Fusion Systems is moving forward with work on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/commonwealth-fusion-systems-books-a-1b-power-deal-for-its-future-fusion-reactor/\">Arc</a>, its first commercial power plant, while <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/bill-gates-backed-commonwealth-fusion-systems-hits-key-reactor-construction-milestone/\">building Sparc</a>, its demonstration plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Berzin is looking forward to hearing what the fusion community thinks. “This is the release of the overview paper. This will be followed up by quite a substantial amount of work that will come out via peer review and publication,” he said. “Now is the moment for us to go and set up the partnerships, collaborations, get the end users engaged to go build the first one.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s something painfully American about the arc of iRobot, the company that taught your vacuum to navigate around the furniture. Founded in 1990 in Bedford, Massachusetts by MIT roboticist Rodney Brooks and his former students Colin Angle and Helen Greiner, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday, punctuating a 35-year run that took it from the dreams of AI researchers to your kitchen floor and, finally, to the tender mercies of its Chinese supplier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brooks, the founding director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab and the robotics field’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/26/famed-roboticist-says-humanoid-robot-bubble-is-doomed-to-burst/\">resident provocateur</a>, spent the eighties watching <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://rodneybrooks.com/what-is-it-like-to-be-a-robot/\">insects</a> and having epiphanies about how simple systems could produce complex behaviors. By 1990, he’d translated those insights into a company that would eventually sell over 50 million robots. The Roomba, launched in 2002, became the rare gadget that transcended its category to become a verb, a meme, and, to the amusement of many, a<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt5rBfNucc\"> cat-transportation device</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The money soon followed, with the company raising $38 million altogether, including from The Carlyle Group, before going public in a 2005 IPO that raised $103.2 million. By 2015, iRobot was flush enough to launch its own venture arm, prompting TechCrunch to wryly declare that “robot domination may have just taken <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/23/the-dawn-of-our-robot-overlords-inches-closer-as-irobot-starts-vc-shop/\">another step forward</a>.” The plan at the time was to invest $100,000 to $2 million in up to 10 seed and Series A robotics startups each year. It was the kind of move that marks a company’s arrival, the moment when you’re successful enough to fund the next generation’s dreams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then Amazon came knocking. In 2022, the corporate giant agreed to acquire iRobot for $1.7 billion in what would have been Amazon’s fourth-largest acquisition ever at the time. In a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amazon-and-irobot-sign-an-agreement-for-amazon-to-acquire-irobot-301600720.html\">press release</a> announcing the tie-up, Angle, who’d been CEO since the company’s inception, spoke about “creating innovative, practical products” and finding “a better place for our team to continue our mission.” It seemed like a fairy tale ending — the scrappy MIT spinoff absorbed into the Everything Store’s sprawling empire.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Except European regulators had other ideas. Indeed, amid threats they would block the deal — they believed Amazon could foreclose rivals by restricting or degrading access to its marketplace — Amazon and iRobot agreed to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/amazon-irobot-scrap-acquisition-deal-7072122\">kill the deal</a> in January 2024, with Amazon paying a $94 million breakup fee and walking away. Angle resigned. The company’s shares nosedived. It shed 31% of its workforce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement to TechCrunch, Angle reflected on the company’s downfall with evident frustration. “For more than 35 years, iRobot led the consumer robotics industry and created a category that brought robots into millions of homes. Today’s outcome is profoundly disappointing — and it was avoidable,” he said. “This is nothing short of a tragedy for consumers, the robotics industry, and America’s innovation economy. Regulatory opposition to the Amazon–iRobot acquisition removed the most viable path for a pioneering American robotics company to scale and compete globally.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What followed afterward was a slow-motion collapse. Earnings had been declining since 2021 thanks to supply chain chaos and Chinese competitors flooding the market with cheaper robot vacuums. The Carlyle Group, which provided a $200 million lifeline back in 2023, ultimately just prolonged the inevitable. (Carlyle finally <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-01/carlyle-sells-debt-of-roomba-maker-as-bankruptcy-risks-loom\">sold that loan</a> last month — presumably at a discount, though it didn’t specify either way.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now it’s over, at least, the version of iRobot that existed previously. Shenzhen PICEA Robotics, iRobot’s main supplier and lender, will take control of the reorganized company. According to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/irobot-announces-strategic-transaction-to-drive-long-term-growth-plan-302641744.html\">release</a> issued by iRobot on Sunday, the restructuring plan allows iRobot to remain as a going concern and “continue operating in the ordinary course with no anticipated disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships, or ongoing product support.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also vowed to “meet its commitments to employees and make timely payments in full to vendors and other creditors for amounts owed throughout the court-supervised process.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What this means for customers longer term is another question, one iRobot was eager to answer when we reached out to the company. “To be clear, today’s news has no impact on our business operations or our ability to serve our customers – which continues to be our top priority,” said spokeswoman Michèle Szynal in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “We remain focused on delivering intelligent home innovations that make consumers’ lives better and easier.  Our products are not changing.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its release, iRobot similarly promises to keep supporting existing products during restructuring; at the same time, its legal disclosures acknowledge the inherent uncertainties of bankruptcy — whether suppliers stick around, whether the process goes as planned, whether the company survives at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As The Verge noted in a story about iRobot’s struggles <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/817536/irobots-revenue-has-tanked-and-its-almost-out-of-cash\">last month</a>, even if iRobot eventually collapses and takes its cloud services down with it, customers’ Roomba vacuums won’t become useless pucks. The physical controls should keep working — a Roomba owner could still jab the button to send it off to vacuum or tell it to head home. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What Roomba owners would lose is everything that make the devices feel futuristic, including app-based scheduling, the ability to tell it which rooms to clean, and voice commands <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/1418\">barked at Alexa</a> while sprawled on the couch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: This story has been updated with comment from iRobot and from Angle, its co-founder and longtime CEO.<br></em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Digital advocacy groups, policy experts, and industry groups representing major digital platforms — including Meta — have warned, however, that the approach risks regulatory overreach and could disrupt legitimate use, especially in a country where WhatsApp has evolved into everyday infrastructure for personal communication and small-business commerce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The directions, which app providers including Meta, Telegram, and Signal must comply with within 90 days of their issuance on November 28, require messaging apps to remain tied to the SIM card used at sign-up. The web and desktop versions of these apps also require users to log out every six hours and re-link their devices via a QR code to regain access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mandatory continuous SIM–device binding and periodic logout ensure that every active account and web session is anchored to a live, KYC-verified SIM, restoring traceability of numbers used in phishing, investment, digital arrest, and loan scams,” the telecom ministry said in a press release earlier this month, adding that India suffered cyber-fraud losses exceeding ₹228 billion (about $2.5 billion) in 2024 alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government has clarified that the rules do not apply when the SIM remains in the device, and the user is roaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the directions apply broadly to major instant messaging apps, their impact is likely to be felt most acutely by WhatsApp, which is <a href=\"https://entrackr.com/2021/02/govt-says-whatsapp-has-530-mn-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">used by more than 500 million people</a> in India. The app’s adoption in India is also unusually deep. As much as 94% of WhatsApp’s Indian monthly user base opened the app daily in November, while 67% of WhatsApp Business users in the country did the same, according to Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch. By comparison, 59% of WhatsApp monthly users in the U.S. opened the app daily, alongside 57% for WhatsApp Business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many merchants in India rely on the WhatsApp Business app — a smartphone-based version of the service tailored for small enterprises — typically registering the account on a SIM-linked phone while handling customer conversations through WhatsApp’s web or desktop client on another device. Unlike larger companies that use <a href=\"https://business.whatsapp.com/products/business-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WhatsApp’s Business APIs</a> for automated, CRM-linked communication, these small businesses access their customers through WhatsApp Business and its companion web interface, meaning mandatory SIM binding and frequent forced logouts could break workflows for order-taking, support, and customer engagement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potential disruption in India comes as WhatsApp has been steadily expanding its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-multi-device-support/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">multi-device</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/whatsapp-launches-long-awaited-ipad-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">companion-device</a> capabilities, allowing users and businesses to stay logged in across phones, browsers, and devices without relying on a single active smartphone.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rapid-expansion-to-deep-entrenchment\">Rapid expansion to deep entrenchment</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The directions come as WhatsApp is undergoing a significant shift in India, its biggest market, with growth increasingly driven by retaining existing users rather than rapidly expanding its new user base.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp’s monthly active users in India on mobile devices are up 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to date, even as downloads have fallen nearly 49%, per Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch. Compared with late 2022, WhatsApp’s monthly active users in India are up 24%, while downloads are down 14% over the same period, the market intelligence firm said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It could be fair to say that user (MAU) growth for WhatsApp in India across the past few years has been driven more by retention (successfully re-engaging existing or previous users) than acquiring new users,” said Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data from Appfigures shows WhatsApp Business has consistently recorded more estimated first-time installs than WhatsApp Messenger in India since early 2024, reflecting how growth has increasingly been driven by merchant adoption rather than broad-based consumer expansion.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075808\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=768,560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=1200,875 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=1280,933 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=430,314 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=720,525 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=900,656 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=800,583 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=1536,1120 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=668,487 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=514,375 514w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=846,617 846w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=708,516 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/whatsapp-downloads-india.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of that pattern reflects how WhatsApp is used in India, said Randy Nelson, head of insights at Appfigures. It is common for merchants to maintain separate WhatsApp identities for personal and customer communication, often enabled by dual-SIM phones, while a single business can generate multiple installs across staff and shop devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sensor Tower data points in the same direction. WhatsApp Business monthly active users in India were still growing year over year in late 2025 and are up more than 130% compared with 2021, far outpacing WhatsApp Messenger’s roughly 34% growth over the same period, the market intelligence firm’s data estimates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While overall engagement remains higher on WhatsApp — with Indian users opening the app daily and spending an average of 38 minutes a day in November, compared with 27 minutes on WhatsApp Business — the gap looks different in the U.S., where users spent about 23 minutes a day on WhatsApp and 27 minutes on WhatsApp Business, Sensor Tower estimates show.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-s-directions-raise-serious-questions-of-technical-feasibility\">India’s directions raise “serious questions of technical feasibility”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement last week, industry body Broadband India Forum (BIF), whose members include Meta, said the measures could result in “material inconvenience and service disruption on ordinary users,” adding that they raise “serious questions of technical feasibility.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The directions hinge on a new and still-contested classification of Telecommunication Identifier User Entities (TIUEs) under India’s telecom cybersecurity rules, said Kazim Rizvi, founding director of New Delhi-based public policy think tank The Dialogue, effectively placing messaging apps within a telecom framework — a shift from their traditional regulation under the country’s IT Act — through executive directions rather than formal legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The directions derive their power not from statute but from delegated legislation,” Rizvi told TechCrunch. “Moreover, the lack of public consultations or technical working groups risks creating compliance friction without addressing the underlying fraud vectors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s telecom ministry did not respond to a request for comments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, companies including Meta have limited room to challenge the directions in court, according to tech policy experts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Challenging the directions would typically require showing either that they exceed the scope of the underlying law or that they violate constitutional protections, said Dhruv Garg, a tech policy advisor and partner at the Indian Governance and Policy Project — a high bar that may be difficult to meet in this case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta declined to comment on this article.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It offered two products — mortgage loans with 1% cash back, as well as the credit card with rewards including cash back, travel, and offset mortgage payments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, CEO Kelley Halpin told TechCrunch that the startup had “taken what everybody loves about travel and dining cards to re-contextualize that for the homeowner/parent.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In theory, you could earn points for home expenses by using any credit card with rewards, but Mesa said it structured its points program to incentivize spending related to home ownership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So it’s not rewarding you on travel and dining spend; it’s rewarding you on gas, groceries, your HOA, utilities, home goods as well as your mortgage payment,” Halpin said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bilt, which has a rewards card that allows customers to earn points on rent payments, says it will <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/travel/news/bilt-card-timeline\">expand with points for mortgage payments</a> when it launches a revamped card next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mesa’s card shutdown has been covered by travel deals websites like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://onemileatatime.com/news/mesa-homeowners-card-shuts-down/\">One Mile at a Time</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upgradedpoints.com/news/mesa-homeowners-card-shuts-down/\">Upgraded Points</a>, which say that Mesa cardmembers have been complaining about declined transactions for the past week, with the company initially claiming this was only a temporary outage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, it seems the only remaining way to redeem points earned on the Mesa card is through a statement credit at a rate of 0.6%.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Kirsten noted that it’s just the latest move bringing more consolidation to the media business, and she wondered whether it’s “too big a risk” for Netflix.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, I discussed a call with Netflix executives where Wall Street analysts also seemed to be struggling to wrap their heads around the deal. And then of course there’s Paramount’s competing hostile bid — whatever happens, Warner Bros.’ days as a standalone company seem to be numbered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can read an edited preview of our conversation below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirsten:</strong> I remember when Netflix was just a little baby startup and I got their [DVDs] in the mail. Here they are, all grown up, bidding for a legacy company. Did that run through your head when you saw the news?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthony:</strong> Certainly symbolically, it’s this moment where the upstart has eaten Hollywood. There’ve been all these articles, even before this deal, saying, “Netflix is eating Hollywood, Netflix is transforming Hollywood.” Regardless of whether or not this deal ends up going through, Netflix will have transformed Hollywood, but this seems like the biggest — both symbolically but also substantively — one of the most dramatic things that can happen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there are all these other questions about: Will Netflix get regulatory approval? Will Paramount’s hostile bid succeed?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What jumped out to you is you were catching up on it, Kirsten?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirsten:</strong> Well, the first thing was I was like, can there be any more consolidation in this market? I mean, that was the big one for me, because if memory serves, Warner Bros. already went through like this consolidation with Discovery, right? So here we are again. There’s been so much consolidation that I have lost track of all of that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the second thought was what I immediately thought, what I kicked [off our discussion] with, which is really thinking about how Netflix [has grown], and there have been these dips in the road along its way, where the headlines have been about how it’s struggling, and will it remain relevant, and how can it do that? If they’re successful in the actual deal, [it would] potentially reflect [that] they have made it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But then again, they have to execute on [running] an even bigger company than ever before. And so I guess my third thought on this is: <em>Should</em> they be buying this? Is this what it takes for them to expand? Is it a risk for them to take on so much? Why not just stay as they are? And I don’t know if you agree with me on that one. Is it too big of a risk? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthony:</strong> I can see how it makes sense for Netflix. It’s a way to take a [content] library that is already quite large, and they’ve obviously had some very successful TV shows — less so on the movie side — [but] potentially, they just become so much stronger on the content side.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">[And] they’re suddenly now involved in all these other businesses, although the question is to what extent are they going to invest in things like the theatrical business, theme parks, making TV shows for other streaming services and networks, which are all businesses that Warner Bros. is in, and Netflix says it will continue to support. But we’ll see to what extent that’s true.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So it seems like something that can really benefit Netflix in some ways, but, at the same time, it does seem like this is a huge risk. If you go and look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2025/Dec/05/Netflix-Inc-_M-A-Call_2025-12-05T00_00_00_English.pdf\">the analyst call that Netflix’s executives did</a> after announcing the deal, you can see that the analysts are wrestling with it and wondering “Okay, I can see that this grows your business, but does it grow your business [so much that it’s] worth an $82 billion deal?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then of course, beyond the Netflix perspective, you have everybody else in Hollywood. There are all these maybe <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/how-would-the-netflix-warner-bros-deal-reshape-hollywood/\">accurately hyperbolic headlines</a> about: Is this the end of Hollywood? Is this the end of the movie theater business? All the unions are basically saying either, “This deal should be blocked” or “We’re very, very, very worried about this deal.” The theater owners are saying that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And so I think there’s A) Is this a good deal for Netflix? And B) is this a good deal for the entertainment business? I don’t have a good answer for either, [but] I think it’s more likely to be a good deal for Netflix than it is to be a good deal for the entertainment business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though again, part of what to keep in mind as people weigh those options or think about possible outcomes here, is that because of the way that Paramount has forced Warner Bros. to consider these acquisition offers, it seems unlikely that Warner Bros. is going to be able to continue as an independent company — which, if you’re not a fan of media consolidation, that is disappointing.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Netflix is showing Hollywood what happens when a startup grows up\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B61hRlk0yPU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

I’m not sure I would categorize it as such, but how about I let the journalist on the ground give his assessment? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Via Sean (and a few of my thoughts sprinkled in) after the event …</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was easy to get lost in the buzz words at times during Rivian’s “Autonomy &amp; AI Day” this week. But there was a clear underlying message being shared: Rivian is trying to build a company that is about more than just selling cars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not going as far as Tesla. For instance, there were no humanoid robots wandering around the company’s Palo Alto campus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it is clearly building out other revenue-generating products — and advanced driver assistance is at the starting gates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian’s hands-free version of its driver-assistance software — which today can be used on about 135,000 miles of road — will expand to 3.5 million miles and include surface streets. This expanded capability, which will launch in early 2026 and eventually include point-to-point hands-free (but eyes on) automated driving comes with a cost of $2,500 or $49.99 per month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there is its future hands-off, eyes-off system. Rivian revealed it has developed its own custom 5nm processor, which it says will be built in collaboration with both Arm and TSMC. That chip will power Rivian’s “autonomy computer” — the backbone of an upgraded automated-driving system —that will debut in the R2 SUV in late 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That will probably be an upcharge, although Rivian didn’t say if it would be more than the $2,500 fee. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there’s another scenario we should also consider: licensing its tech to others. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After all, Rivian already has a joint venture with Volkswagen Group to share its electrical architecture and base-level software. And Rivian spun out two startups this year with Also (mobility) and Mind Robotics (industrial AI and robotics). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Barclays’ Dan Levy wrote Friday that “subsequent discussions reiterated hopes/potential” for Rivian to license its whole AV platform, or just components like the customs processor. And when I asked <strong>CEO RJ Scaringe</strong> if Rivian will sell the processor to Mind Robotics, he responded wryly: “It doesn’t take a lot of imagination.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the most abstracted level, bolting new revenue lines to the existing car business (especially if those new projects play nice with the cars) makes sense. Who doesn’t love more money?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Here’s our coverage of the event:</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/rivian-is-building-its-own-ai-assistant/\">Rivian is building its own AI assistant</a> (deeper dive into the tech). <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivians-ai-assistant-is-coming-to-its-evs-in-early-2026/\">And it is coming to its EVs in early 2026</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivian-goes-big-on-autonomy-with-custom-silicon-lidar-and-a-hint-at-robotaxis/\">Rivian goes big on autonomy with custom silicon, lidar, and a hint at robotaxis</a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nothing this week — or should I say, thanks for the tips, everyone, but there is nothing I can share yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, here’s a tiny tidbit to hold you over. As you read above, senior reporter Sean O’Kane was at <strong>Rivian</strong>’s<strong> AI &amp; Autonomy Day</strong> and one of the whispers he heard was about the company’s public demo of its AI assistant and concerns it might not work. Apparently, the testing the morning of the event was a bit touch and go.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alas, the public demo went just fine after one tense moment at the start. The risks are high for public demos, which is why many companies avoid them. Kudos to Rivian for going for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

But here we are. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aircraft startup <strong>Boom Supersonic</strong> kicked off 2025 by breaking the sound barrier with its XB-1 demonstrator civil aircraft. And it’s ending the year with a plan to sell a version of its turbine engine as a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/boom-supersonic-raises-300m-to-build-natural-gas-turbines-for-crusoe-data-centers/\">stationary power plant</a>. Its first customer will be data center startup <strong>Crusoe</strong>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the deal, Crusoe will buy 29 of Boom’s 42-megawatt turbines for $1.25 billion to generate 1.21 gigawatts for its data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boom has raised $300 million to help commercialize this new business. The round was led by Darsana Capital Partners with participation from Altimeter Capital, Ark Invest, Bessemer Venture Partners, Robinhood Ventures, and Y Combinator. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan is to use money from its Superpower stationary turbine business to fund the development of its supersonic aircraft. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention …</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Self-driving trucks company <strong>Aurora Innovation</strong> made a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://ir.aurora.tech/news-events/press-releases/detail/129/detmar-selects-aurora-to-deploy-expanded-fleet-of-autonomous-trucks-for-major-energy-producer\">commercial agreement</a> with Detmar Logistics to autonomously transport frac sand in the Permian Basin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some deals don’t always work out, or they change. Take <strong>SK On</strong> and <strong>Ford</strong>, for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Four years ago,<strong> </strong>Ford and South Korean battery maker SK On struck a deal to form a joint venture and spend $11.4 billion to build factories in Tennessee and Kentucky that would produce batteries for the next generation of electric F-Series trucks.

A new investor is participating in the remaining portion of the primary, but TechCrunch could not confirm its specifics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WestBridge Capital is doubling down in the new round with a check of a similar size to its previous investment, the people said. The firm invested about $35 million to $40 million in Spinny’s Series F round earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the secondary portion of the transaction is being sold by Indian VC firm Fundamentum, according to the people, while Blume Ventures is also expected to pare part of its stake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Accel, Fundamentum, and Blume Ventures did not respond to requests for comments. WestBridge Capital declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March, Spinny raised <a href=\"https://www.thearcweb.com/article/spinny-raises-seriesf-accel-flat-valuation-niraj-singh-LUH52tUbb3ZXgddn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$131 million</a> in the first part of its Series F round led by Accel, with participation from Fundamentum, before expanding the raise to <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/spinny-raises-40-million-from-westbridge-in-extended-funding-round-13119962.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about $170 million</a> in June to include WestBridge Capital. Those funds were earmarked to scale Spinny’s core used-car business. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the new round is being raised specifically to finance the acquisition of GoMechanic and invest in its platform, without drawing on the startup’s existing cash reserves, the people said. Earlier reports suggested Spinny could buy GoMechanic for <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/spinny-to-acquire-gomechanic-in-rs-450-crore-cash-plus-stock-deal-13665938.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">around ₹4.5 billion</a> (approximately $49.70 million) in a cash-and-stock deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A consortium led by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/distressed-indian-startup-gomechanic-acquired-by-lifelong-group-led-consortium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lifelong Group acquired GoMechanic</a> in 2023 after the startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/sequoia-india-backed-gomechanic-faces-severe-trouble/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">admitted to “grave errors” in its financial reporting</a>. The startup had previously been backed by high-profile investors, including Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, and SoftBank.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Spinny, acquiring GoMechanic would deepen its control across the used-car value chain. The Gurugram-based startup has built a large consumer-facing business, selling about 13,000 used cars a month, primarily directly to buyers and, to a lesser extent, to dealers through its auction platform. Spinny operates its own large reconditioning centers to refurbish vehicles before sale and relies on third-party service shops for after-sales servicing of customer cars — a gap GoMechanic could bring in-house.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GoMechanic would also act as a “two-way” funnel for Spinny, a person familiar with the matter said. The platform would service vehicles bought or sold through Spinny, and help attract car owners who may not yet be customers. That could help expand Spinny’s vehicle supply without significantly increasing customer acquisition costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition comes as India’s used-car market is projected to grow at a <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/business/indias-used-car-market-set-to-double-and-hit-10-million-mark-by-2030-indian-blue-book/article70276235.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">compound annual growth rate of about 10%</a> to roughly 9.5 million units by 2030, from nearly 6 million units today, per a recent report by Mahindra First Choice and Volkswagen Pre-owned Certified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The GoMechanic deal would mark Spinny’s latest move to broaden its footprint in India’s automotive market. In recent months, the startup has expanded beyond used-car sales by <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/used-car-marketplace-spinny-acquires-autocar-operator-haymarket-s-automotive-titles-in-india-12970812.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquiring auto publications</a> Autocar India, Autocar Professional and What Car?

According to the sheriff’s department, the footage shows that after dropping off the food and taking a photo, the woman appeared to spray a substance towards the food from a small aerosol can attached to her keychain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sheriff’s department said that using DoorDash records, detectives identified the woman as Kourtney Stevenson of Kentucky, who told local police in a phone call that she had been working for DoorDash while visiting her father, and that she’d used pepper spray to spray a spider. But the department also said that with an overnight low of 35 degrees Fahrenheit, “outdoor spiders in Indiana are not active and would not be capable of crawling on exposed surfaces.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Stevenson allegedly declined to come in for an interview, detectives obtained a warrant to arrest her for battery resulting in a moderate injury and consumer product tampering. She is now awaiting extradition to Indiana.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A DoorDash spokesperson said in a statement that Stevenson has been banned from the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have absolutely zero tolerance for this type of appalling behavior,” the spokesperson said. “The Dasher’s access to the platform has been permanently removed, and our team is supporting law enforcement with their investigation.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/13/us/kentucky-delivery-driver-pepper-spray-food.html\">The New York Times</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doordash-driver-told-authorities-was-trying-spray-spider-rcna248953\">NBC News</a> both report that it’s not clear if Stevenson has a lawyer who can comment on her behalf.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Five minutes later, a man carefully pushed it out of everyone’s way, the words “I’m stuck” flashing yellow on the poor droid’s screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was an inauspicious start to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivian-goes-big-on-autonomy-with-custom-silicon-lidar-and-a-hint-at-robotaxis/\">Rivian’s “Autonomy &amp; AI Day,”</a> a showcase for the company’s plans to make its vehicles capable of driving themselves. Rivian doesn’t make the cafeteria robot and isn’t responsible for its abilities, but there was a familiar message in its foibles: this stuff is hard.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hours later, as I rode in a 2025 R1S SUV during my 15-minute demo of Rivian’s new self-described “Large Driving Model,” I was reminded of that message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EV equipped with the automated-driving software drove myself and two Rivian employees on a switchback route near the company’s campus. As we glided past Tesla’s engineering office, I noticed a Model S in front of us slow to turn into the rival company’s lot. The R1S eventually noticed this, too, braking hard just before the Rivian employee nearly intervened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During my demo drive, there was one actual disengagement. The employee in the driver’s seat took over as we passed through a one-lane section of road due to some tree-trimming. Minor stuff overall. But it wasn’t exactly rare either; I spotted multiple <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0VXkDTt8dQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other demo rides</a> that had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0VXkDTt8dQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disengagements</a>, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rest of the drive went well enough for software that is not ready to be shipped, especially when you consider that Rivian threw out its old rules-based driver assistance system and adopted an end-to-end approach — which is how Tesla developed Full Self-Driving (Supervised). It stopped at stoplights, it handled turns, it slowed for speed bumps, all without programmed rules telling it to do these things.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-quiet-pivot-in-2021\">A quiet pivot in 2021</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075742\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Rivian</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian’s old system “was all very deterministic, and it was all very structured,” CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview Thursday. “Everything that the vehicle did was the result of a prescribed control strategy written by humans.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scaringe said that when Rivian saw transformer-based artificial intelligence taking off in 2021, he quietly “reconstituted the team and started with a clean sheet and said, let’s design our self-driving platform for an AI-centric world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After spending “a lot of time in the basement,” Rivian launched the new ground-up driving software in 2024 on its second-generation R1 vehicles, which use Nvidia’s Orin processors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scaringe said it was only recently that his company started to see dramatic progress “once the data started really pouring in.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian is betting it can train its Large Driving Model (LDM) on fleet data so quickly that it will allow the company to roll out what it calls “Universal Hands-Free” later this month. That means Rivian owners will be able to take their hands off the wheel on 3.5 million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada (so long as there are visible painted lines). In the back half of 2026, Rivian will allow “point-to-point” driving, or the consumer version of the demo we received Thursday.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-eyes-off-to-hands-off-challenge\">The ‘eyes off’ to ‘hands off’ challenge</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the end of 2026, after Rivian has started shipping its smaller, more affordable R2 SUVs, it will ditch the Nvidia chips and outfit those vehicles with a new custom autonomy computer unveiled Thursday. That computer, plus a lidar sensor, will eventually allow drivers to take their hands and eyes off the road. True autonomy — where a driver doesn’t have to worry about re-taking control of the vehicle — lies well beyond that and will largely depend on how fast Rivian can train its LDM.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This rollout introduces a near-term challenge for Rivian. The new autonomy computer and lidar won’t be ready until months after the R2 goes on sale. If customers want a vehicle that can handle eyes-off driving (or more), they’ll have to wait. But the R2 is a crucial product for Rivian, and the company needs it to sell well — especially in the wake of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/rivians-best-case-guess-for-2025-sales-is-a-16-drop-from-last-year/\">declining sales of its first-generation vehicles</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When tech is moving as fast as it is, there’s always going to be some level of obsolescence, and so what we want to do here is to be really direct” about what’s coming, Scaringe said. The early R2s will still get Rivian’s promised “point-to-point” driving, which will be based on the new software and will be hands-off but not eyes-off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So [if] you’re buying an R2 and you buy it in the first nine months, it’s just going to be more constrained,” he said. “I think what will happen is some customers will say ‘that matters a lot to me, and I’m going to wait.’ And some will say ‘I want the newest, best things now, and I’m going to get the R2 now, and maybe I’ll trade it in a year or two, and I’ll get the next version later. Fortunately, there’s so much demand backlog for R2 that we think, by being upfront with this, customers can make the decision themselves.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In a perfect world, everything times at the same time, but the timeline of the vehicle and the timeline of the autonomy platform are just not perfectly aligned,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first interviewed</a> Scaringe in 2018, before Rivian even showed what its vehicles looked like, he shared a goal that still rattles around my head. He wanted to make Rivian’s vehicles so capable of driving themselves that: “if you go for a hike, and you start at one point and you finish at another point, you have the vehicle meet you at the end of the trail.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was the kind of pie-in-the-sky promise about self-driving cars that was all the rage seven years ago, but it stuck with me at least because it was something that felt true to Rivian’s whole brand of aspirational adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scaringe told me Thursday he still thinks it’s possible for Rivian to enable a use case like that in the next few years. It certainly won’t happen until the company tests and builds its more-capable R2 vehicles, which is at least a year away in a best-case scenario.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We could [do that]. It’s not been a huge focus,” he said. That could change as the company gets closer to level 4 autonomy, though, since by then the company will have its LDM trained on trickier roads without guiding features like lane lines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Then, it becomes a bit of a like, what’s the ODD [operational design domain]? Dirt roads, off road? Easy,” he said. Just don’t expect a Rivian driving itself up <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/537057/rivian-r1t-hells-gate-moab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hell’s Gate</a> in Moab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not putting any resources into rock crawling autonomously,” he said. “But in terms of getting to the trail head? For sure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to reflect that Rivian’s Universal Hands-Free update is coming later this month.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
