Subscribers can give access to up to family members, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before this, Google’s cheapest AI subscription available in the country was AI Pro, which was priced at ₹1,950 per month ($21.69).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Google is late to customize its pricing for India, as the AI Plus plan was first introduced <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1965490977000640833\">in Indonesia in September</a>, and offered it in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/googles-cheaper-ai-plus-plan-is-now-available-in-over-40-countries/\">other countries that very month</a>. OpenAI debuted its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\">sub-$5, ChatGPT Go plan in India in August</a> and made it available in other countries in subsequent months. The plan allows users to have 10 times more limits than the free plan for messages, image generation, and file uploads. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI companies have been busy offering freebies in India as they seek to tap its huge population for users. First, Perplexity <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/perplexity-sees-india-as-a-shortcut-in-its-race-against-openai/\">partnered with telco Airtel</a> to offer its Pro plan for a year to all Airtel customers for free. OpenAI also offered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/\">ChatGPT Go free for a year</a> to existing subscribers of Go and new users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Google teamed up with telco Reliance Jio to offer <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.jio.com/google-gemini-offer/\">its AI Pro plan for 18 months</a> at no cost to users on a certain carrier plan.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The country has also attracted interest from AI firms such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity, as a large share of the population comes online for the first time, and a growing developer base accelerates the adoption of GenAI applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the things that I look for is what’s happening here,” said Russell Grandinetti, senior VP of international stores at Amazon, at the company’s annual small business-focused Smbhav event in New Delhi. “That’s inevitably going to become part of how we run our business around the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon faces strong competition in India from Walmart-backed Flipkart, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/meeshos-606m-ipo-pops-as-enthusiasm-for-indias-e-commerce-startups-rises/\">Meesho</a>, and quick-commerce firms such as Swiggy’s Instamart, Zomato’s Blinkit and Zepto, which are expanding fast and targeting the same urban consumer base. However, with its immense logistics network and more than 1.7 million sellers, the company does enjoy scale advantages in the market.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“India continues to be Amazon’s one of the largest long-term opportunities,” said Amit Aggarwal, senior VP of emerging markets at Amazon.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Last year, Fervo raised nearly $500 million in equity and debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enhanced geothermal has been in development for years but has recently soared as favorable conditions have lifted its prospects. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chief among them is rising data center demand. Large tech companies like Google and Meta have been eyeing geothermal as a potential solution to their energy needs. Earlier this year, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found that by 2030, enhanced geothermal could provide <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/geothermal-could-power-nearly-all-new-data-centers-through-2030/\">nearly two-thirds of new data center demand</a> at or below what operators are paying today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geothermal is also viewed favorably within the Trump administration. Energy secretary Chris Wright’s previous company, Liberty Energy, participated in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/trumps-pro-fracking-energy-secretary-pick-has-also-invested-in-geothermal-and-nuclear-startups/\">$138 million round</a> that Fervo raised in 2022. Like many of its peers, the company uses fracking and directional drilling techniques borrowed from the oil and gas industry. Many Fervo employees used to work in oil and gas, applying their knowledge of drilling and subsurface development to a new challenge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fervo is considered a frontrunner among enhanced geothermal startups, which drill deeper than existing geothermal developers to tap hotter rocks and deliver more power.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That knowledge has helped Fervo bring down the time it takes to drill a new well. The company’s first wells took about a month, but this summer, Fervo announced that it had completed one in 16 days. “We are in the mid-teens these days, on average, for our well drilling times,” Jewett said. “That is pretty good, but we always have more improvements to make.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s obsession with drilling time is both economic and a point of pride. “Roughly half the cost of wells is in the drilling time,” Jewett said. Shorter drilling times mean that Fervo can complete power plants more quickly, bringing in revenue sooner. They’re also a sign of mastery. “It’s also a good representation of how much you’re investing in the well, how much you’re troubleshooting, how many issues are plaguing you that end up costing money,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Fervo is focused on the Western U.S., where hot rocks sit closer to the surface. At the company’s Cape Station site in Utah, for example, Fervo has to drill down 8,500 feet to tap into 450˚ F rock. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you go to Pennsylvania or West Virginia, [the hot rock] exists much lower,” Jewett said. Only after the company is comfortable with how quickly it can drill a well in the West will it expand elsewhere, including abroad.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are a lot of really high-potential places across the world,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the U.S., though, there are plenty of different types of rock for Fervo to drill through, giving it the potential to build up sufficient technical experience before heading to other countries. By that point, Jewett expects that differences in regulations will be the primary hurdle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given skyrocketing energy demand from data centers and Fervo’s progress at Cape Station, there have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/geothermal-unicorn-fervo-energy-may-ipo-as-early-as-next-year/\">rumors</a> that the company might file for go public in the coming year or so. Jewett wouldn’t comment on those, but she said that the company is seeing “off-the-charts demand.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Traditional antibodies are grown inside animals and then screened manually in the lab, which can be a slow and expensive process.

Instead of “raising” antibodies in animals, they can be treated almost like software. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We predict how proteins fold in 3D, design synthetic antibodies using AI, and test millions of variants virtually before making a single one in the lab,” explained Inito co-founder and CTO Varun A Venkatesan in an email. “This produces antibodies that are far more sensitive, consistent, and stable than anything developed through traditional methods.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Inito, this will unlock the next generation of at-home tests. Venkatesan says the company is already using these methods in R&amp;D and that its wet-lab is showing promising results. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074296\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=1200,802 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=1280,855 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=900,601 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=561,375 561w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=924,617 924w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Inito</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The real vision is bigger than adding new tests,” said Inito co-founder and CEO Aayush Rai. “The endgame is to redefine diagnostics altogether. If you want to understand what’s happening inside your body at every life stage and health need, you shouldn’t be limited by clinic appointments, lab schedules, or rigid testing systems. You should be able to measure, track, and get insights about your body from home, with lab-grade confidence.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inito wants to expand its vision beyond a “trying to conceive” platform. Its reader and app will soon power tests for pregnancy, menopause, and broader at-home health monitoring. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our long-term roadmap goes far beyond fertility,” said Rai. “We’re building toward a platform that can measure and interpret the full spectrum of hormones that shape health across a lifetime. Pregnancy progression, menopause, and broader endocrine markers like testosterone — all powered by AI antibodies and imaging that sets Inito apart today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is going to use part of the funding to scale manufacturing and grow globally to meet growing demand across the United States and new international markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inito’s latest funding round was led by Bertelsmann India Investments and Fireside Ventures. The investment brings Inito’s total funding to around $45 million.

In March, the AI cloud infrastructure provider went public in one of the biggest and most anticipated IPOs of the year that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/coreweave-co-founder-explains-how-a-closet-of-crypto-mining-gpus-led-to-a-1-5b-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">didn’t live up to its hype.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another setback took place in October, when a planned acquisition of the cloud provider’s business partner, Core Scientific, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/ai-mania-tanks-coreweaves-core-scientific-acquisition-it-buys-python-notebook-marimo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">faltered</a> due to skepticism from the acquisition target’s shareholders. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, the firm has acquired a number of different companies, its stock has <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-months-coreweave-ipo-fizzled-202659856.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gone up</a> and <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/coreweave-stock-price-convertible-bond-debt-b80cb3b9?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf_GTbKaBDutljK6HnVGrUi329TIw6rbvk2FzbBV9S7QZHLlLzT1GGq0bjuUIs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69388c93&amp;gaa_sig=rhfwcBxjtr5ICwdZwg4-63kU5phSDvciX7w__XEOECGnUL8MwQnFDouc0SStN0TXcWdGIZ-WrYvwkDEVaUnQXQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">down</a>, and it’s been both <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91457190/coreweave-ai-boom-cloud-nvidia-openai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">criticized</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/coreweave-earnings-debt-ai-infrastructure-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lauded</a> for its role in the booming AI data center market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an interview at the Fortune Brainstorm AI summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, CoreWeave’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Intrator, defended his company’s performance from critics, noting that it was in the midst of creating a “new business model” for how cloud computing can be built and run. Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/tariff-turmoil-may-have-killed-the-tech-ma-markets-comeback/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">President Trump’s tariffs went into effect</a> — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90. Its more wary critics <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/coreweave-and-palantir-get-meme-stock-comparisons-as-shares-soar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have compared it</a> to a meme stock due to its penchant for going up and down. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the uncertainty around CoreWeave’s stock <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/coreweave-stock-price-convertible-bond-debt-b80cb3b9?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf_GTbKaBDutljK6HnVGrUi329TIw6rbvk2FzbBV9S7QZHLlLzT1GGq0bjuUIs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69388c93&amp;gaa_sig=rhfwcBxjtr5ICwdZwg4-63kU5phSDvciX7w__XEOECGnUL8MwQnFDouc0SStN0TXcWdGIZ-WrYvwkDEVaUnQXQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has been credited</a> to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/822011/coreweave-debt-data-center-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hefty level of debt</a>. Not long after CoreWeave announced a deal on Monday to issue even more debt to finance its data center buildout, its stock <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91457190/coreweave-ai-boom-cloud-nvidia-openai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped some 8%</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intrator seems to see his company as a disruptor, one whose unconventional tactics may take some getting used to. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” he said during his appearance Tuesday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CoreWeave actually started its corporate life <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/coreweave-scrappy-cryptominer-multibillion-dollar-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as a crypto miner</a> but in short order built itself into a pivotal provider of “AI infrastructure” to some of the tech industry’s most major players. In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/openais-investment-into-thrive-holdings-is-its-latest-circular-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“Circular” business deals</a>, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-24b-ai-deal-blitz-has-wall-street-asking-questions-about-murky-circular-investments-110039309.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised questions</a> about the industry’s long-term economic stability. Perhaps not surprisingly, since <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-quietly-buys-more-stock-210300633.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nvidia is one of its investors</a> and its supplier of GPUs, Intrator swatted away such concerns. “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand,” he said. “You do that by working together.”<br> <br>Since the IPO, CoreWeave has continued to make efforts to expand its business. After it acquired <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/coreweave-acquires-ai-developer-platform-weights-biases/\">Weights &amp; Biases</a>, an AI developer platform, in March, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/03/coreweave-acquires-agent-training-startup-openpipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it went on to acquire OpenPipe</a>, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning.

(For the record, we would advise that you do not give tech companies unfettered access to even more of your data.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McLeod founded Hinge in 2011 as a dating app with a greater focus on building relationships than facilitating casual dates. The app, which is on track to hit $1 billion in revenue by 2027, was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/match-fully-acquires-relationship-focused-app-hinge/\">acquired</a> by Match in 2019.

McLeod will remain in an advisory position at Hinge through March.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This summer, TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/hinge-cmo-jackie-jantos-hopes-to-help-make-gen-zers-less-lonely/\">spoke to Jantos</a> at SXSW London about how Hinge will address Gen Z, a market that’s growing <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/06/dating-apps-doomed-former-hinge-leader-says-gen-z-meet-in-person/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">increasingly disillusioned</a> with meeting people online.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a generation that has grown up with a deep understanding of how digital experiences are created and what they are trying to get out of them,” Jantos told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gen Z wants transparency and authenticity from digital brands, according to Jantos. While some might see this as inherently incompatible with the company’s growing reliance on AI, Hinge’s AI recommendation feature, launched in March, drove a <a href=\"https://ir.mtch.com/investor-relations/news-events/news-events/news-details/2025/Match-Group-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">15% increase</a> in matches and contact exchanges in the first quarter of this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on Jantos’ comments upon assuming her new role, it seems that Hinge will continue investing in these features under her leadership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our focus will remain on intentional innovation that is grounded in culture, creativity, and a deep understanding of how people connect today,” Jantos said in a statement.<br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But that market insight isn’t cheap, nor is it quick. <a href=\"https://www.cashewresearch.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cashew Research</a> wants to change that using AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calgary, Alberta-based Cashew uses AI to develop market research plans and surveys for brands based on what information they are looking for — like what their brand recognition is for a specific population or how a marketing tagline resonates with customers. Cashew then sends the survey to real people and uses AI to summarize and digest the findings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cashew was one of the 200 startups chosen for TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield competition in 2025 and won the Enterprise Stage pitch competition at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2025&amp;utm_content=ticketsales&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=tc\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can use an LLM to try to do deep research and get answers to your questions, or you could use a firm that’s going to be really expensive,” Addy Graves, co-founder and CEO of Cashew, told TechCrunch in describing the current market research industry. “Now there’s Cashew that exists in the middle. It creates custom, fresh data to answer your question instead of you just using an LLM that’s surfacing the same recycled pool of data that everybody’s finding on the internet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves has more than a decade of market research experience. The original idea for Cashew was sparked by an issue she ran into frequently: Clients wanted full research projects — with real-world data from humans — done within a few days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, shortening that timeline while still producing the same quality of research results wasn’t possible, Graves said, because the technology to speed up the process wasn’t ready yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That was definitely the aha moment,” Graves said. “And it wasn’t until the onset of AI that we were actually able to automate these processes that we use as researchers, best practices, these data science-backed methodologies, as well as the formatting of reports that we know that everybody wants.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bringing automation to the process also brings the cost down, which makes Cashew an option for small and medium-size brands that wouldn’t have been able to afford to work with a traditional market research firm, Graves added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves founded Cashew in 2023 alongside Rose Wong, chief operating officer, with an initial focus on consumer packaged goods, specifically food and beverage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves said she thinks Cashew can stand out in the increasingly crowded AI marketing tools category because it isn’t fully automated. Each Cashew client gets fresh human data with each project, which requires market research expertise, Graves said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cashew’s competitive advantage may only grow as the company matures. The company takes all of the real-world data it collects from its clients’ projects, anonymizes it, and puts it in a database, which can help add additional proprietary data to future research projects, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised C$1.5 million in pre-seed funding and is gearing up to launch its seed round in early 2026 with the hope of raising up to $5 million, Graves said. That capital will be put toward continuing to develop the product’s tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves said the company’s two main areas of focus heading into next year are increasing the company’s presence in the U.S. and also working to build up its B2B business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The people who are already buying research, that’s already a massive category, but that doesn’t even include all the people that could be buying research but just can’t afford it or can’t do it right now because they don’t have the timelines,” Graves said. “We’re actually creating this new category for marketers to gain access to answers to these questions that they’ve had.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During his tenure, he backed Indian startups such as Meesho, Khatabook, CredAvenue, Bounce, and Bizongo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are living through one of the most profound technological revolutions in history, and one of the toughest tests of investor discipline,” Narang wrote. “AI scales thought itself, compressing the gap between idea and output. The founders who pair that speed with pricing power and improving unit economics will define the next generation of enduring value.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside developing the new investment platform, Narang told founders that he is taking 1% to 2% personal stakes in companies he believes can “compound intelligently.” This suggests he plans to stay active in early-stage investing while setting up a broader vehicle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">B Capital confirmed Narang’s exit to TechCrunch and noted that Eduardo Saverin, Karan Mohla, and Howard Morgan would manage its Asia portfolio alongside the existing team in South and Southeast Asia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After more than eight years with the firm, Kabir Narang, who focused on later stage growth investing efforts in Asia, has left his role to pursue other opportunities,” a B Capital spokesperson said. “We are grateful for his contributions, and we wish him continued success in the future.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2015 by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and former Bain Capital executive Raj Ganguly, B Capital is a multi-stage investor focused on technology, healthcare, and resilience tech.

Cursor also confirmed the existence of those models in November when it said in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/series-d\">blog post</a>, “Our in-house models now generate more code than almost any other LLMs in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His comments about the models came up at Fortune’s event when the founder was asked how he plans to compete with the LLM makers that he relies on when the major ones — OpenAI, Anthropic — have their own AI coding offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truell likened their coding products to “a concept car,” whereas his product is a production automobile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It would be like taking an engine and a concept car around it instead of a whole end-to-end car that was manufactured,” Truell said. “What we do is we take the best intelligence that the market has to offer from many different providers. And we also do our own product-specific models in places. We take that, we build it together and integrate it, then also build the best tool and end UX for working with AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cursor’s dependence on its competitors — and its need to build its own LLMs — has been a subject of speculation among VCs in Silicon Valley since earlier this year when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/why-openai-wanted-to-buy-cursor-but-opted-for-the-fast-growing-windsurf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI reportedly looked at Anysphere</a> as an acquisition target. Anysphere turned the idea down. (This was around the same time that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Windsurf’s OpenAI deal also didn’t materialize</a>, with the founder eventually joining Google.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue, investors told TechCrunch, was that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/more-details-emerge-on-how-windsurfs-vcs-and-founders-got-paid-from-the-google-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI coding editors were losing money</a> thanks to high costs they paid to the model makers. In Cursor’s case, instead of selling, it adjusted pricing to a usage model in July, directly passing along the API fees that model makers charge to its users. This change from an all-inclusive subscription fee (and the surprise big bills some customers faced) caused <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an uproar among some of its users</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, when asked about the pricing kerfuffle, Truell said, “When we started Cursor, you would turn to Cursor for a quick JavaScript question and now you’re turning to it to do hours of work for you. So the pricing model had to shift for us and others in the space. That means shifting more towards a consumption model,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truell added that one of the tools the company is working on is cloud-computing-like cost-management tools, which lets enterprises monitor their total usage and keep tabs on the bills their engineers are running up.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a whole team internally dedicated to enterprise engineering and building things like spend controls and billing groups and visibility,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, he said Cursor is focused on two major areas for the next year. One is handling more complex agentic functions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want you to take end-to-end tasks, ones that are concise to specify but then are really hard to do, and have them entirely be done by Cursor. An example is a bug fix,” Truell explained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He particularly wants Cursor to be able to fix the kinds of bugs that might be easy to describe but take “weeks of someone’s time, thousands of times running the code” to handle. “We want Cursor to do that, end-to-end,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other area he named, but didn’t explain with much detail, was the idea of “thinking about teams as the atomic unit that we serve,” he said. This must be in contrast to serving individual coders, and a hint to how well its enterprise business is going. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to cost-monitoring features, Truell said he wants Cursor to handle more parts of the software development life cycle outside of writing code. He pointed to Cursor’s code review product as an example, which he said is being used by some customers to analyze every pull request, be it written by AI or human. (A pull request is when a programmer submits code for review before it is merged into the main project.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So you’ll see us start to help teams more as a whole,” with more features like that, he promised.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, big competitors are also all gearing up for the complex-task agentic world. Amazon just released a coding tool it promises can <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">already run for days on end</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just this week, the AI power players, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, and <a href=\"https://aaif.io/members/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many others</a>, launched a new consortium under the Linux Foundation to develop open source agentic interoperability standards. They even contributed some of their key projects, like Anthropic’s wildly popular Model Context Protocol (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/github-microsoft-embrace-anthropics-spec-for-connecting-ai-models-to-data-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MCP</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His plans for the year likely won’t put Anysphere firmly ahead of Cursor’s main model-maker competitors. They should, however, keep the company in the race.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, in an interview earlier this year, Rivian’s software chief Wassym Bensaid told TechCrunch it was targeting the end of the year. The company will likely share more during its upcoming <a href=\"https://rivian.com/autonomy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI &amp; Autonomy Day</a>, which will be livestreamed starting at 9 a.m. PT December 11.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian’s plans are reflective of the moment as the pace of development from foundational AI companies — the tech giants and startups like Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI that are building the core models and infrastructure — accelerates and industries scramble to keep up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as Bensaid noted to TechCrunch earlier this year, this isn’t some slapdash effort to stay on trend. Nor is it simply a chatbot thrown into the infotainment system. The company has put considerable thought, resources, and time into the product, Bensaid said, noting that it’s designed to be integrated with all vehicle controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company started with an underlying philosophy to build an overall architecture that is model and platform agnostic, according to Bensaid. The Rivian AI assistant team, which is based out of the company’s Palo Alto office, soon realized effort and attention should also be directed toward developing the software layers that help coordinate various workflows as well as the control logic that resolves conflicts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And that’s the in-vehicle platform we have built,” Bensaid said. “We use what the industry loves to now call an agentic framework; but we thought about that architecture since very early so that we can interface with different models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The in-house AI assistant program is consistent with Rivian’s push to become more vertically integrated. In 2024, Rivian <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/06/rivian-refresh-r1t-r1s-second-generation-speed-range-apple/\">overhauled its flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV</a>, changing everything from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, sensor stack, and software user interface. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also put considerable resources toward developing and improving its own software stack, which includes everything related to real-time operating systems (RTOS) that manage the car, such as thermal dynamics, ADAS, and safety systems, as well as another layer related to the infotainment system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bensaid didn’t provide detailed information about the AI assistant, but he did say it includes a mix of models that handle specific tasks. The result is a hybrid software stack that combines edge AI, where tasks are handled on the device, and cloud AI, in which large models that require more compute are handled by remote servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This should mean a flexible, customized AI assistant that splits the workload between the edge and cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian developed much of the AI software stack in-house, including its own custom models and the “orchestration layer,” the conductor or traffic cop of sorts that makes sure the various AI models work together. Rivian tapped other companies for specific agentic AI functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The mission is to develop an AI assistant that increases customer trust and engagement, Bensaid said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the AI assistant is staying within Rivian. The company’s joint venture with Volkswagen is focused on software, but not an AI assistant or anything to do with automated driving.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The technology joint venture with Volkswagen, which was announced in 2024 and is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/the-rivian-volkswagen-joint-venture-deal-is-now-up-to-5-8b/\">worth up to $5.8 billion</a>, is centered on the underlying electrical architecture and zonal compute, and infotainment. The joint venture officially kicked off in November 2024 and is expected to supply the electrical architecture and software for Volkswagen Group as early as 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autonomy and AI are separate for now, but “it doesn’t mean that it may not be in the future,” Bensaid said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Fifty-nine percent of teens say they use ChatGPT, which is more than twice as popular as the next two most-used chatbots, Google’s Gemini (23%) and Meta AI (20%). Forty-six percent of U.S. teens say that they use AI chatbots at least several times a week, while 36% report not using AI chatbots at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pew’s research also details how race, age, and class impact teen chatbot use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">About 68% of Black and Hispanic teens surveyed said they use chatbots, compared to 58% of white respondents. In particular, Black teens were about twice as likely to use Gemini and Meta AI as white teens.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The racial and ethnic differences in teen chatbot use were striking […] but it’s tough to speculate about the reasons behind those differences,” Pew Research Associate Michelle Faverio told TechCrunch. “This pattern is consistent with other racial and ethnic differences we’ve seen in teen technology use.

When it comes to household income, about 62% of teens living in households making more than $75,000 per year said they use ChatGPT, compared to 52% of teens below that threshold. But Character.AI usage is twice as popular (14%) in homes with incomes below $75,000.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While teenagers may start out using these tools for basic questions or homework help, their relationship to AI chatbots can become <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">addictive and potentially harmful</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The families of at least two teens, Adam Raine and Amaurie Lacey, have sued ChatGPT maker OpenAI for its alleged role in their children’s suicides — in both cases, ChatGPT gave the teenagers detailed instructions on how to hang themselves, which were tragically effective. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/openai-claims-teen-circumvented-safety-features-before-suicide-that-chatgpt-helped-plan/\">claims</a> it should not be held liable for Raine’s death because the sixteen-year-old allegedly circumvented ChatGPT’s safety features and thus violated the chatbot’s terms of service; the company has yet to respond to the Lacey family’s complaint.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Character.AI, an AI role-playing platform, is also facing scrutiny for its impact on teen mental health; at least <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/magazine/character-ai-chatbot-lawsuit-teen-suicide-free-speech.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">two teenagers</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/lawsuit-characterai-chatbot-colorado-suicide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">died by suicide</a> after having prolonged conversations with AI chatbots. The startup ended up making the decision to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/character-ai-is-killing-the-chatbot-experience-for-minors/\">stop offering its chatbots to minors</a>, and instead launched a product called “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/character-ai-will-offer-interactive-stories-to-kids-instead-of-open-ended-chat/\">Stories</a>” for underage users that more closely resembles a choose-your-own-adventure game.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The experiences reflected in the lawsuits against these companies make up a small percentage of all interactions that happen on ChatGPT or Character.AI. In many cases, conversations with chatbots can be incredibly benign. According to OpenAI’s data, only <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-says-over-a-million-people-talk-to-chatgpt-about-suicide-weekly/\">0.15% of ChatGPT’s active users</a> have conversations about suicide each week — but on a platform with 800 million weekly active users, that small percentage reflects over one million people who discuss suicide with the chatbot per week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Even if [AI companies’] tools weren’t designed for emotional support, people are using them in that way, and that means companies do have a responsibility to adjust their models to be solving for user well-being,” Dr. Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and director of Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Earlier this year, Boom’s XB-1 demonstrator was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/booms-xb-1-becomes-first-civil-aircraft-to-go-supersonic/\">the first civil aircraft</a> developed by a private company to break the sound barrier.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crusoe is paying $1,033 per kilowatt of generating capacity. For that, Boom will deliver the turbines, generators, control systems, and preventative maintenance. Crusoe will have to provide everything else, including pollution controls, electrical connections, and so on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s on the higher side for that type of power plant. A <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/powerplants/capitalcost/pdf/capital_cost_AEO2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">typical airplane-derived</a> — or aeroderivative — turbine costs around $1,600 per kilowatt, a price that also includes pollution controls, engineering, construction, land acquisition, permitting, pipelines, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a typical project, the turbine and pollution controls contribute about 46% of a project’s total cost. Applying that percentage to Boom’s figures would likely push the total cost to over $2,000 per kilowatt. That’s pricey for a simple-cycle gas turbine and <a href=\"https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/gas-turbine-prices-are-up-and-arent-going-down-anytime-soon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more in line</a> with costs for combined-cycle gas turbines slated to come online in the early 2030s.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boom’s Superpower is targeting 39% efficiency, similar to competitors. Combined cycle turbines can recover heat from the exhaust to boost efficiency above 60%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boom is also developing a “field upgrade” to convert its turbines from simple cycle to combined cycle, Scholl said. Operators could do so today using existing combined-cycle kits, though adding them would require longer installation times. “Those combined-cycle plants tend to be construction projects,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other aeroderivative turbine generators, Superpower will be delivered in a shipping container, and developers like Crusoe will be responsible for electrical and gas hookups in addition to pollution controls. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scholl said the power plants should be “no louder” than existing aeroderivative turbines, though that’s not exactly quiet: Residents near xAI’s Colossus data center report hearing similarly sized turbines from <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/24/southaven-residents-fear-pollution-complain-of-noise-from-elon-musks-xai-data-center-turbines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">at least half a mile away</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first few stationary turbines will be made at Boom’s existing facilities while the company builds a larger factory. The goal is to produce 1 gigawatts’ worth in 2028, 2 gigawatts’ worth in 2029, and 4 gigawatts’ worth in 2030. If Boom can hit those numbers, it would represent a <a href=\"https://rmi.org/gas-turbine-supply-constraints-threaten-grid-reliability-more-affordable-near-term-solutions-can-help/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">significant expansion</a> in the turbines available to be deployed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boom still has a challenging few years ahead of it. If the company can pull it off, supersonic commercial flights could happen sooner than even Boom expected. But scaling production is never easy, and many startups have struggled to cross the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/27/climate-startup-valley-of-death/\">valley of death</a> that separates early-stage hardware companies from their commercial peers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Amazon’s Ring doorbells will now be able to identify your visitors through a new AI-powered facial-recognition feature, the company said on Tuesday. The controversial feature, dubbed “Familiar Faces,” was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/ring-cameras-can-now-recognize-faces-and-help-to-find-lost-pets/\">announced earlier this September</a> and is now rolling out to Ring device owners in the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says the feature lets you identify the people who regularly come to your door by creating a catalog of up to 50 faces. These could include family members, friends and neighbors, delivery drivers, household staff, and others. After you label someone in the Ring app, the device will recognize them as they approach the Ring’s camera. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, instead of alerting you that “a person is at your door,” you’ll receive a personalized notification, like “Mom at Front Door,” the company explains in its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/amazons-ring-to-partner-with-flock-a-network-of-ai-cameras-used-by-ice-feds-and-police/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launch announcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature has already received pushback from consumer protection organizations, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/legal-case-against-rings-face-recognition-feature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like the EFF</a>, and a U.S. senator. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon Ring owners can use the feature to help them disable alerts they don’t want to see — like those notifications referencing their own comings and goings, for instance, the company says. And they can set these alerts on a per-face basis.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is not enabled by default. Instead, users will need to turn it on in their app’s settings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, faces can be named in the app directly from the Event History section or from the new Familiar Faces library. Once labeled, the face will be named in all notifications, in the app’s timeline, and in the Event History. These labels can be edited at any time, and there are tools to merge duplicates or delete faces.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon claims the face data is encrypted and never shared with others. Plus, it says unnamed faces are automatically removed after 30 days. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074302\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FF-Mockups.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ring</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-privacy-concerns-over-ai-facial-recognition\">Privacy concerns over AI facial recognition</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite Amazon’s privacy assurances, the addition of the feature raises concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has a history of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/27/this-is-how-police-request-customer-data-from-amazon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">forging partnerships with law enforcement</a> and even once gave police and fire departments the ability to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/amazon-reverses-course-revokes-police-access-to-ring-footage-via-neighbors-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">request data from the Ring Neighbors app</a> by asking Amazon directly for people’s doorbell footage. More recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/amazons-ring-to-partner-with-flock-a-network-of-ai-cameras-used-by-ice-feds-and-police/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon partnered with Flock</a>, the maker of AI-powered surveillance cameras used by police, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-secret-service-navy-all-had-access-to-flocks-nationwide-network-of-cameras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">federal law enforcement, and ICE</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ring’s own security efforts have fallen short in the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/amazon-ring-ftc-settlement-lax-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ring had to pay a $5.8 million fine in 2023</a> after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission found that Ring employees and contractors had broad and unrestricted access to customers’ videos for years. Its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/ring-neighbors-exposed-locations-addresses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Neighbors app also exposed</a> users’ home addresses and precise locations, and users’ <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/ring-doorbell-passwords-exposed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ring passwords</a> have been floating around the dark web for years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given Amazon’s willingness to work with law enforcement and digital surveillance providers, combined with its poor security track record, we’d suggest Ring owners, at the very least, be careful about identifying anyone using their proper name; better yet, keep the feature disabled and just look to see who it is. Not everything needs an AI upgrade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result of the privacy concerns, Amazon’s Ring has already faced calls from U.S. senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) to <a href=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-demands-amazon-abandon-plan-to-include-facial-recognition-technology-in-ring-doorbells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">abandon this feature</a>, and is facing backlash from consumer protection organizations, like the EFF. Privacy laws are preventing Amazon from launching the feature in <a href=\"https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/ILCS/Articles?ActID=3004&amp;ChapterID=57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Illinois</a>, <a href=\"https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/docs/bc/htm/bc.503.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Texas</a>, and Portland, Oregon, the EFF had also noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/ring-answers-familiar-faces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">questions posed by the organization</a>, Amazon said the users’ biometric data will be processed in the cloud and claimed it doesn’t use the data to train AI models. It also claimed it wouldn’t be able to identify all the locations where a person had been detected, from a technical standpoint, even if law enforcement requested this data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it’s unclear why that would not be the case, given the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/ring-cameras-can-now-recognize-faces-and-help-to-find-lost-pets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">similarity to the “Search Party” feature</a> that looks across a neighborhood’s network of Ring cameras to find lost dogs and cats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reached for comment, EFF’s Staff Attorney, F. Mario Trujillo, said, “Knocking on a door, or even just walking in front of it, shouldn’t require abandoning your privacy. With this feature going live, it’s more important than ever that state privacy regulators step in to investigate, protect people’s privacy, and test the strength of their biometric privacy laws.” <br></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated after publication with EFF comment.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
