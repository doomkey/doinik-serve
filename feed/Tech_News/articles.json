The feature offers suggested questions based on the video, or users can use their remote’s microphone button to ask anything related to the video. For instance, they might ask about recipe ingredients or the background of a song’s lyrics, and receive instant answers without pausing or leaving the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, this feature is available to a select group of users over 18 and supports English, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube first launched this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/youtube-to-test-generative-ai-features-including-a-comments-summarizer-and-conversational-tool/\">conversational AI tool</a> in 2024 to help viewers explore content in greater depth. The expansion to TVs comes as more Americans now access YouTube through their television than ever before. A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/\">Nielsen report</a> from April 2025 found that YouTube accounted for 12.4% of total television audience time, surpassing major platforms like Disney and Netflix.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies are also making significant strides with their conversational AI technologies. Amazon rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/alexa-comes-to-new-fire-tv-devices-with-ai-powered-conversations/\">Alexa+ on Fire TV devices</a>, enabling users to engage in natural conversations and ask Alexa+ for tailored content recommendations, hunt for specific scenes in movies, or even ask questions about actors and filming locations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.roku.com/article/208756908#section-5\">Roku</a> has enhanced its AI voice assistant to handle open-ended questions about movies and shows, such as “What’s this movie about?” or “How scary is it?” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-debuts-its-generative-ai-powered-search-tool/\">Netflix</a> is also testing its AI search experience. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another way YouTube has tried to improve its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/youtubes-latest-updates-are-aimed-at-improving-the-tv-experience/\">TV experience with AI</a> is the recent launch of a feature that automatically enhances videos uploaded at lower resolutions to full HD.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the company continues to launch other AI features, like a comments summarizer that helps viewers catch up on video discussions and an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/youtube-adds-an-ai-overviews-like-search-results-carousel/\">AI-driven search results carousel</a>. In January, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/youtube-will-soon-let-creators-make-shorts-with-their-own-ai-likeness/\">announced</a> that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using AI-generated versions of their own likeness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, YouTube <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/youtube-finally-launches-a-dedicated-app-for-apple-vision-pro/\">launched</a> a dedicated app for the Apple Vision Pro, too, letting users watch their favorite content on a theater-sized virtual screen in an immersive environment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a year-long pilot project, Toyota’s Canadian manufacturing subsidiary has hired seven humanoid robots to work in a plant building RAV4 SUVs under a robots-as-a-service deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After evaluating a number of robots, we are excited to deploy Digit to improve the team member experience and further increase operational efficiency in our manufacturing facilities,” Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada President Tim Hollander said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Digit robot in question is built by Agility Robotics, a firm spun out of Oregon State University in 2015. Digit is intended to work in industrial environments without humans nearby, often bridging two different automated production lines. In this case, the robots will be unloading totes full of auto parts from an automated warehouse tugger.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While seven robots doing manual drudgery may seem a small step compared to sizzle reels of metal humans doing backflips, actually deploying humanoid robots in real workplaces is rare and difficult. Demonstrating a capability in a lab is one thing, but integrating it into a company’s workflow — including maintenance and charging — isn’t easy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When the tech companies spend real time in the field understanding the task that needs to be operated, the real workflows that happens…that’s when we will see a huge uptick in adoption,” Ram Devarajulu, a VP at Cambridge Consultants, said at the Humanoids Summit in late 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agility is among the leaders in getting robots out of the lab, with Digits working in similar capacities for logistics providers like GXO, Schaeffler, and Amazon. The company has a proprietary cloud-based software package called Arc for users to manage fleets of their robots, and says AI will be vital in reducing deployment costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Cost of deployment … can be more than the price of the robot by a lot,” Pras Velagapudi, Agility’s CTO, said in an interview last year. “AI tools let us decrease that cost of deployment, decrease the amount of time getting the robot configured and getting it operating at a level of performance that they want.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMMC and Agility will use this engagement as an opportunity to pioneer other use cases that relieve human workers of repetitive physical tasks and prioritize more valuable work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also preparing a next generation robot that will be safe to operate alongside human workers; current humanoid robots that are strong enough to lift heavy loads are still considered too unreliable to operate autonomously around people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Competitor Figure.AI <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.figure.ai/news/production-at-bmw\">tested</a> its Figure 02 robots in a BMW factory for ten months last year, which the company said unloaded 90,000 parts. Other companies deploying humanoids in pilot programs include Apptronic, Unitree, Tesla, Boston Dynamics, 1X Technology, and Reflex Robotics. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Gay guys have the orgy. It doesn’t mean it’s problematic. It’s a way we bond and connect.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The piece doesn’t let the culture off the hook entirely. As is true wherever power dynamics exist, nine of the gay men interviewed describe experiencing unwanted advances from more senior colleagues — and Bernard doesn’t shy from examining where networking ends and coercion begins. But her sources are careful about what that means: “This is a complex subject and I don’t think readers can draw the distinction between some bad men being gay and all gay men being bad. It can be a slippery slope into homophobia.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Now it wants its own court, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase’s city administrator submitted a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2.18.2026-Packet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proposed ordinance</a> to the city commission during a meeting on Wednesday that would create a municipal court with a part-time judge, prosecutor, and court clerk. Starbase’s mayor will serve as the judge until one is appointed to a two-year term. The administrator wrote that he hopes to have a candidate ready by next month’s meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The formation of a court within Starbase, which currently claims around 580 residents and sits adjacent to SpaceX’s South Texas rocket factory and launch facility, is the latest in a series of steps the city has taken to build up its own municipal services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the volunteer fire department, Starbase is also now handling its own building permits and fire code inspections. And when a plan to contract local county sheriff’s deputies to patrol the city fell apart, the city <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/elon-musks-spacex-company-town-is-getting-a-police-department/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decided instead to start up the Starbase Police Department</a>. (The city is still paying the Cameron County Sheriff’s Department to use its jail facilities, though, according to paperwork filed ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase is still in the process of establishing the police department, and it expects that process could take around six months. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During Wednesday’s meeting, the city commission reviewed an application to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement that is required to stand up the police force. That application revealed some new details about the plans for the new Starbase Police Department.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The city wrote that its expanding population has led to an increase in calls for service. Across 2025, there were 420 calls to law enforcement in the city, 180 calls for fire service, and 140 EMS calls, according to the application. There were also 353 crashes documented in the area last year, with more than 7,000 vehicles traveling Highway 4 — the main artery in and out of Starbase — per day. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Cameron County Sheriff’s Office has not been able to “guarantee dedicated law enforcement coverage for Starbase,” the city wrote, and Starbase’s remote geographic location “requires rapid and reliable” response times. “These limitations have raised significant concerns among residents and city leadership,” the city wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The city’s unique blend of cutting-edge technology and coastal charm, coupled with high median household incomes and rising property values, drives expectations for municipal services, particularly public safety,” the city wrote in the application. The city was also sure to point out that SpaceX launches, which are expected to dramatically increase over the next few years, draw many tourists to the area. “Additionally, The City has a substantial governmental interest in ensuring the integrity of spaceflight operations occurring within its jurisdiction,” the application reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company on Thursday announced the official launch of a trio of options, including Split View, PDF annotations, and a “Save to Google Drive” feature, designed to more deeply integrate Chrome with one of Google’s other online services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While these particular additions aren’t focused on AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/google-brings-gemini-in-chrome-to-us-users-unveils-agentic-browsing-capabilities-and-more/\">Google already integrated its Gemini AI assistant into Chrome</a>. The move was made in response to the increased competition from AI providers like OpenAI and Perplexity, which are dabbling in agentic browsers. These so-called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/as-the-browser-wars-heat-up-here-are-the-hottest-alternatives-to-chrome-and-safari-in-2025/\">browser wars</a> have pushed Google to be less stagnant in terms of developing and releasing more consumer-facing features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Split View, multitasking in Chrome has become easier as the feature puts two pages side-by-side in the same tab. This lets you work across two webpages or watch a video while taking notes, among other things. To use the feature, you’ll drag a tab to the left or right edge of the browser window or right-click a link and select “Open Link in Split View.” The tabs will automatically snap into place.

The move comes as Reddit launched its <a href=\"https://www.business.reddit.com/blog/dynamic-product-ads-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first shoppable ad product</a> last year, called Dynamic Product Ads (DPA), which display personalized product recommendations to users based on their interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, when users who are part of the test search for something like “best noise-canceling headphones” or “electronic gift ideas for a college student,” they will see a carousel of related products at the bottom of the results. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This carousel will feature products directly mentioned by users from conversations on related posts and comments. If users tap on the product, they can view more details and then be directed to the retailer to purchase the item. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This feature surfaces top-recommended products directly from discussions, giving redditors instant information about any product,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/news/in-case-you-saw-it-we-are-testing-a-new-shopping-product-experience-in-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “This test is designed to make Reddit easier to navigate while keeping community perspectives at the center of the experience. We’ll continue learning from how people use this new feature and refine the experience over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While platforms like TikTok and Instagram have long integrated shopping features, Reddit is now looking to follow suit. Of course, Reddit isn’t the only tech platform that recently started exploring AI-driven shopping, as OpenAI’s ChatGPT rolled out an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">“Instant Checkout”</a> feature last September that lets users make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thursday’s announcement comes after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/reddit-looks-to-ai-search-as-its-next-big-opportunity/\">Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said</a> during the company’s earnings release last week that the platforms’s AI search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business, not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huffman also noted that weekly active users for search grew 30% over the past year, increasing from 60 million to 80 million, while weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers feature rose from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If you can’t remember your PIN, you can reset it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes a few months after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/facebook-messengers-desktop-app-is-no-more/\">Meta shut down Messenger’s stand-alone desktop apps</a> for Windows and Mac. The writing may have been on the wall at the time, as Meta had been redirecting existing desktop app users to the Facebook website to continue using the messaging service, rather than the Messenger website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change was first spotted by reverse engineer <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/2023763715674566705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>. Meta is notifying users of the update via a pop-up message on the Messenger website and app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users have taken to social media to <a href=\"https://x.com/_snow118/status/2023722050783945129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">express their frustration</a> with the update, with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1r6pxzp/why_does_meta_keep_removing_every_service_that/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many saying</a> they don’t want to rely on the Facebook website to send and receive Messenger chats on the web, especially those who have deactivated their Facebook accounts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Meta’s decision to shut down various Messenger platforms is frustrating for users, it allows the tech giant to reduce costs by leaving it with fewer platforms to maintain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Messenger first launched as “Facebook Chat” back in 2008, and Facebook (now Meta) launched Facebook Messenger as a standalone app in 2011. Over the years, the tech giant positioned Messenger as its own service outside of Facebook, and in 2014, the social network removed messaging capabilities from its main mobile app to push people to the Messenger app. However, the company reversed this in 2023 when it began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/07/facebooks-latest-test-brings-back-in-app-messaging/\">merging Messenger</a> back into the Facebook app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Hochul spokesperson Sean Butler confirmed to TechCrunch that the proposal has been pulled. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” Butler said in an emailed statement. Bloomberg was the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/new-york-s-robotaxi-plan-pulled-in-setback-to-waymo-expansion?srnd=homepage-americas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first to report</a> the proposal had been removed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The withdrawal is a setback for Waymo which has tried for years — along with other autonomous vehicle (AV) companies — to test and eventually deploy robotaxis in New York.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home,” Waymo said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They want the safety, privacy, and comfort that riders in other major cities already enjoy. While we are disappointed by the Governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety. We will continue to engage constructively with the Governor, the Legislature, and officials around the state to deliver this proven mobility option that New Yorkers are waiting for,” added Waymo’s statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hochul had introduced, as part of her <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/new-york-governor-clears-path-for-robotaxis-everywhere-with-one-notable-exception/\">broader budget proposal</a>, a plan to change a state law that mandates drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That law essentially prevents robotaxi companies like Waymo from operating in the state since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if Hochul’s proposal had survived, it would not have opened the floodgates to AV companies. The proposal contained a number of limitations, including that AV companies could not deploy for-hire robotaxi services in any city with more than a million people. AV companies would also need approval from the state’s transportation commissioner, pay a $1 million fee, and show proof of financial security of at least $5 million. The state would have only backed robotaxi pilots in cities or townships where there was a clear demonstration of local support, Butler said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that proposal dead, the state’s existing AV pilot program, which is far more restrictive, is expected to remain. Under the pilot program, companies can seek an exemption to the one-hand on the wheel rule, allowing them to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state, but not launch commercial robotaxi services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is currently testing in New York City, and is allowed to do so through March 31. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New York City regulators granted a permit last August to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city. Under that permit, Waymo is allowed to test up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, as long as there is a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is active in numerous other states and operates commercial robotaxi services in Atlanta, Austin, Miami, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it provides more than 400,000 paid rides every week and is targeting 1 million weekly rides by the end of the year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The trial, taking place in LA Superior Court, already revealed that Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/metas-own-research-found-parental-supervision-doesnt-really-help-curb-teens-compulsive-social-media-use/\">own research indicated</a> that parental supervision couldn’t prevent teens from compulsive use of social media, and teens who faced traumatic life experiences were even more inclined to overuse social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for the plaintiff, a 20-year-old who goes by her initials KGM, questioned Zuckerberg this week about whether Instagram employees were given goals to increase daily app usage. The Meta CEO had said during an earlier congressional hearing that this was not the case, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-trial-testimony-instagram-c8cbaa32ccbf4933ec3a7beebd6cf34b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the AP noted</a>, but a 2015 email chain presented as evidence in the trial showed Zuckerberg pushing to increase <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-trial-0e9a7fa0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">users’ time spent in app by 12%</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerberg was also asked about Instagram’s use of beauty filters, which Meta’s own experts said should be banned when it comes to teens, as well as internal documents with Meta’s estimates of how many children under the age of 13 were on the platform. One <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-grilled-during-landmark-social-media-addiction-trial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Meta document from 2018 <span>stated that</span></a><span>, a</span>s of 2015, 4 million children under 13 had Instagram accounts, including roughly 30% of children aged 10-12 in the U.S., for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying age verification was difficult and smartphone makers like Apple could be more helpful on this front. (Apple recently rolled out its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/apple-introduces-new-child-safety-initiatives-including-an-age-checking-system-for-apps/\">own age assurance tools</a> for developers, as a result of the increasing push to regulate apps like Facebook and Instagram in the U.S., where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/apple-prepares-to-comply-with-texas-age-assurance-law-but-warns-of-privacy-risks/\">many</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/new-utah-law-makes-app-stores-responsible-for-age-verification/\">states</a> have <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/social-media-and-children-2025-legislation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">now created or are developing</a> their own social media laws.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-trial-testimony-instagram-c8cbaa32ccbf4933ec3a7beebd6cf34b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reports from the courtroom</a> noted Zuckerberg largely stuck to the company’s talking points during his testimony, sometimes claiming the plaintiff’s lawyers were <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-trial-0e9a7fa0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">taking things out of context</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-safety-trial.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mischaracterizing</a> what documents said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaintiff KGM (who also goes by her first name Kaley) sued four social media companies over what she alleges is the harmful and addictive nature of their platforms. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/tiktok-joins-snap-to-settle-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">TikTok</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/snap-reaches-settlement-in-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">Snap</a> settled before the trial began, with YouTube and Meta defending their apps’ success. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the trial, lawyers for Meta have pointed to Kaley’s unhappy childhood as leading to her mental health concerns, not the social apps themselves. The results of this trial by jury could lead to big tech reforms, prompt new laws and regulations, and lead to a settlement with victims, if the tech companies are found to be at fault. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If completed, it would be the largest power plant in the U.S., capable of powering around 7.5 million homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a price tag of $33 billion, the project would be more expensive than recent natural gas-fired power plants, which have skyrocketed in cost, Bloomberg notes. It’s unclear who will ultimately foot the bill, though traditionally rate-payers have shouldered the burden for new generating capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Japanese investor is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">partner in the Stargate project</a> with OpenAI. SB Energy did not say whether the new power plant would feed directly into the grid or if it would power data centers. OpenAI and SoftBank are <a href=\"https://businessjournaldaily.com/preparation-work-begins-on-lordstown-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in the process of building</a> a “proof of concept” data center at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/foxconn-sells-former-gm-factory-to-mystery-buyer-after-failing-to-make-evs/\">GM’s former Lordstown automotive assembly plant</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A power plant of this size is likely to take years, perhaps a decade, to complete even before taking into account the shortage of natural gas turbines. If completed, the project could emit around 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to our calculations based on public, energy-use metrics. When <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/081.%20Gordon,%20Evaluating%20net%20life-cycle%20GHG%20emissions%20intensities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">including methane leaks</a> from the natural gas supply chain, the climate impact could be even bigger. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

For instance, new headlines and articles from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/feed/\">your favorite news site</a> would appear as new, unread entries in the RSS reader (aka news reader or feed reader) of your choice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The format was hugely popular in the early 2000s until the 2006 arrival of Twitter shifted people to another platform for real-time news and information sharing. Within a few years, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/rest-in-peace-rss/\">people were ditching Google’s popular RSS reader,</a> Google Reader, in favor of Twitter’s 140-character posts. Another few years later, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/rip-google-reader/\">Google Reader shut down for good</a>. (We still miss it.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But RSS itself never died. In addition to being the underlying tool for podcast distribution, you can still use the format to syndicate from websites through RSS apps like Feedly, NetNewsWire, Inoreader, <a href=\"https://reederapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reeder</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Current, however, proposes a different RSS experience. Instead of structuring feeds as lists to be processed, or unread counts driven to zero, the app’s main screen is a river.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094185\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg 2362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1200,634 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1280,676 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=720,380 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=900,476 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=800,423 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1536,812 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=2048,1082 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=668,353 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1168,617 1168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=708,374 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Screenshot</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Current on the App Store</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re not watching content drift past like a screensaver.

This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After this story was published, a Tenga spokesperson told TechCrunch that the breach affected “approximately 600 people” in the United States, based on a forensic review. “We have already proactively contacted those who may have been impacted to ensure their safety and provide guidance,” said the spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#multi-factor-authentication\">multi-factor authentication</a>, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company spokesperson would not say if there was any multi-factor on the email account prior to the breach. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga was founded in 2005 in Japan, and is headquartered in Tokyo. Tenga sells a variety of sex toys, mostly for men. It’s unclear if the breach affected customers outside of the United States, given that the email came explicitly from Tenga Store USA.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga is the latest in a long list of sex toy makers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/sex-toy-maker-lovense-caught-leaking-users-email-addresses-and-exposing-accounts-to-takeovers/\">such as Lovense last year</a>, and adult websites, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/hacking-group-says-its-extorting-pornhub-after-stealing-users-viewing-data/\">Pornhub</a> last year and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/sexting-site-sextpanther-data-exposed/\">SexPanther</a> in 2020, that have been hacked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>First published on February 13</em>. <em>Updated with comment from Tenga spokesperson.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Email addresses and phone numbers of parents, as well as information about children’s siblings, were also exposed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Florida-based VenturEd Solutions, which develops and maintains Ravenna Hub, <a href=\"https://www.ravennasolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">says</a> on Ravenna Hub’s website that it serves over a million students, and processes hundreds of thousands of applications a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch first learned of the vulnerability on Wednesday and soon after alerted the company. VenturEd fixed the bug the same day, but TechCrunch held this report until we could verify that the bug was fixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nick Laird, the chief executive of VenturEd Solutions, told TechCrunch in an email that the company was able to replicate the issue and has addressed the vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laird said the company was investigating the incident, but he would not commit to notifying users about the security lapse, or say — when asked by TechCrunch — if the company has the ability to check if there was any improper access to other users’ data. We also asked if Ravenna Hub had its security checked by a third-party, and if so, by whom. Laird would not say, and declined to comment further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear who, if anyone, oversees cybersecurity at VenturEd and Ravenna Hub.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/cisa-nsa-australia-idor-flaws/\">common security flaw</a> that allows users to access stored information because of weak or non-existent security controls on the concerned servers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, the bug allowed any logged-in user to access another student’s data, including their personal information, by modifying the unique number associated with a student’s profile using their web browser’s address bar. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of Ravenna Hub, student numbers are sequential, meaning it was possible for any user to access another student’s data by changing the profile number by one or more digits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch created a new account with test data, we found that the web address contained a seven-digit number. As such, there were slightly more than 1.63 million records prior to ours that were accessible to any other user.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the latest security lapse involving simple security flaws affecting the personal information of children. In January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/ustrive-security-lapse-exposed-personal-data-of-its-users-including-children/\">online mentoring site UStrive exposed the personal information of its users</a>, many of whom are still in school. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Asare said he came to believe that the future lay in people managing AI employees.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “And if that’s true, we’ll need a real system to manage them, with structure around onboarding, coordination, and oversight for digital workers,” he added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, the duo launched <a href=\"https://withreload.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reload</a>, an AI workforce management platform. On Thursday, the company announced its <a href=\"https://epic.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first AI product, Epic</a>, alongside a $2.275 million round led by Anthemis, with participation from Zeal Capital Partners, Plug and Play, Cohen Circle, Blueprint, and Axiom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reload is a platform that lets organizations manage their AI agents across teams and departments. Companies can connect agents, regardless of who built them (whether by a third party or internally), assign them roles and permissions, and track the work they perform. “Reload acts like the system of record for AI employees, providing visibility, coordination, and oversight as agents operate across functions,” said Asare, the company’s CEO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, he observed, teams are using multiple agents simultaneously for tasks such as coding, debugging, and refactoring. The problem is that these agents are often focused solely on whatever they were prompted to do and don’t necessarily retain long-term memory of what a product is or why they were told to perform a specific function. They operate, in other words, with only short-term memory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, an agent can lose context, or the system can evolve away from its original intent. That’s why Reload is launching Epic. Built on top of the Reload platform, it serves as an architect alongside other coding agents, continuously defining a product’s requirements and constraints, and reminding agents what they are building and why, to keep a system consistent as it develops. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In software development specifically, coding agents can generate large amounts of code, but they don’t preserve shared system understanding over time,” Asare said. “Epic complements those agents by defining the system upfront and maintaining shared context as it evolves. It doesn’t replace coding agents; it makes them more effective.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epic is designed to live inside the coding environments where developers already work. It can be installed as an extension in AI-assisted code editors like Cursor and Windsurf, running alongside other agents inside these tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When a team starts a project, Epic helps create the core system artifacts such as product requirements, data models, API specifications, tech stack decisions, diagrams, and structured task breakdowns,” Asare said, adding that these are the foundations that coding agents build against. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As development progresses, Epic maintains a structured memory of decisions, code changes, and patterns,” he continued. “If you switch coding agents, your structure and memory follow. If multiple engineers use different agents on the same project, everyone builds against the same shared source of truth.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asare and Das previously had a company together that was acquired and this is their second company together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI infrastructure space is crowded. Competitors include LongChain, which helps with AI agent deployment and memory management, and CrewAI, which helps enterprises manage their AI agents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Das said Epic is different because it “defines the system upfront and maintains shared project-level context across agents and sessions,” with a focus specifically on building infrastructure to maintain AI employees. “Traditional workforce systems weren’t designed for AI agents operating as teammates,” said Das, who serves as the company’s CTO. “That’s the layer we’re focused on.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh capital will go toward hiring and product advancement, specifically expanding the infrastructure needed to support a growing number of AI agents. “We’re building for the next era of work,” Asare said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to add the other investors in the round. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, users can adjust the digital crown on the watch to set a target state of charge or adjust the temperature inside the vehicle. The app also allows users to pick four quick controls, depending on which they use the most.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some limitations, however, for Rivian’s first-generation R1T trucks and R1S SUVs. Owners of these cars will only be able to lock or unlock their vehicle by opening the app and tapping the lock icon on the Watch. Second-generation R1 vehicles, meanwhile, will unlock automatically as the driver approaches the car, provided a digital key has been set up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Apple Watch integration follows a broader update to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/techcrunch-mobility-rivians-savior/\">vehicle software system</a> that was rolled out on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most of the updates focus on improving performance and accessibility, including a “kneel mode” that lowers the vehicle another inch below its previous low setting. The update will also allow drivers to toggle between different drive modes without causing the advanced driver assistance system to disengage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a new cold weather indicator that will add a blue tint to the battery graphic displayed on the vehicle’s digital screen so drivers can see how much energy the battery pack is used for warming.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian makes and sells EVs, but software has become one of its central products, and a selling point, for consumers as well as companies like Volkswagen that have tapped the carmaker for its technology.

Companies like Apple and Qualcomm are in the early stages of making on-device AI more useful. Amid all that, the 14-person technical team of London-based <a href=\"https://trymirai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mirai</a> is working to improve how models run on phones and laptops.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai, which is backed by a $10 million seed round led by Uncork Capital, was founded by Dima Shvets and Alexey Moiseenkov last year. Both founders have experience in building scalable consumer apps. Shvets co-founded face-swapping app Reface, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/reface-grabs-5-5m-seed-led-by-a16z-to-stoke-its-viral-face-swap-video-app/\">which was backed by a16z</a>. Shvets later also became a scout for the venture firm. Moiseenkov was CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/prisma-uses-ai-to-turn-your-photos-into-graphic-novel-fodder-double-quick/\">the last decade’s viral AI filters app, Prisma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As consumer developers, both had been thinking about AI and machine learning on devices even before generative AI became popular, Shvets said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we met together in London, we started to chat about technology, and we realized that within the hype of GenAI and more AI adoption, everybody speaks about cloud, about servers, about AGI coming. But the missing piece is on-device [AI] for consumer hardware,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shvets and Moiseenkov wanted to use AI to create a pipeline that would allow them to enable complex tasks on the phone, which led them to start Mirai. When they asked others who developed consumer apps, they heard that many wanted better cost optimization and margin per token usage, too.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094301\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=430,254 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=720,426 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=900,533 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=800,473 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=668,395 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=634,375 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=1043,617 1043w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=708,419 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Co-founders Alexey Moiseenkov and Dima Shvets</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Mirai</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Mirai is developing a framework for models so they can perform better on devices. The company has built an inference engine for Apple Silicon that optimizes on-device throughput. With its upcoming SDK, developers can integrate the runtime in their apps with only a few lines, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the visions why we started the company was that we wanted to give developers, like this Stripe-like, eight lines of code [integration] experience…you basically go to our platform, integrate the key, and start working with summarization, classification, or whatever your use case is,” Shvets said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built this engine in Rust, which can bump up a model’s generation speed by up to 37%, they claim. The company said that, while tuning the model for a platform, it doesn’t tinker with model weights to ensure there is no loss in quality of the output.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai’s stack currently focuses on improving text and voice modalities on the platform, with plans to support vision in the future. The team has started to work with frontier model providers to tune their models for edge use and is in talks with different chipmakers. Later, it plans to bring its engine to Android, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Mirai aims to release on-device benchmarks so model makers can test on-device performance. Shvets recognizes that not all AI work can be done on-device, though. To enable a mixed mode of operation, the team is building an orchestration layer to send requests that can’t be fulfilled on the device up to the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the startup is not directly working with apps just yet, its engine could power on-device assistants, transcribers, translators, and chat apps, we’re told.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andy McLoughlin, managing partner at Uncork Capital, noted that he invested in an edge machine learning company in the last decade. He said that the company was early and eventually sold its business to Spotify. In today’s world, the situation is different, he thinks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given the cost of cloud inference, something has to change… For now, VCs are happy to continue funding the rocket ship companies, spending inordinate sums on cloud inference. But that won’t last  —  at some point, people will focus on the underlying economics of these businesses and realize that something has to change,” he said. “It feels like every model maker will want to run part of their inference workloads at the edge, and Mirai feels very well-positioned to capture this demand.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai’s seed round also saw participation from individuals, including Dreamer CEO David Singleton, YC Partner Francois Chaubard, Snowflake co-founder Marcin Żukowski, ElevenLabs co-founder Mati Staniszewski, former Google AdSense product manager and Coinbase board member Gokul Rajaram, Groq investor Scooter Braun, Turing.com CTO Vijay Krishnan, Theory Forge Ventures’ Ben Parr and Matt Schlicht, and ex-Netflix technical leader Aditya Jami.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He took a few stabs at starting new AI businesses, but nothing really stuck until he got a call from a friend who wanted help filling out customs paperwork.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu got “very curious” and started cold-calling customs brokers in the Los Angeles area. He learned that many are mom-and-pop affairs still deeply reliant on fax machines and paper. When his first customer showed him stacks of manila folders during a FaceTime tour of her office, everything clicked, Basu told TechCrunch. He flew to that customer’s office the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That was the eye-opening moment. There’s just papers and papers,” Basu said in a recent interview. “I was both shocked and impressed. Shocked that this is how the industry runs, and impressed that everything around us, from the watch that you’re wearing to the glasses, literally everything that’s imported, and this is what’s happening behind the scenes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This seed of an idea is now called Amari AI, a startup co-founded by Basu and Arushi Vashist, a former senior software engineer at LinkedIn. The pair, and their small team, have already collected more than 30 customers, and helped those firms move more than $15 billion of goods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amari has also raised $4.5 million of funding co-led by preeminent early-stage firms First Round Capital and Pear VC, all before coming out of stealth mode on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu has two goals with Amari. One is to help customs brokers modernize. To date, he said, many of them have done little work to integrate new technologies. Some leverage optical character recognition software to help speed up data entry, but that tech is limited and brittle, he said. Amari is meant to help automate data entry and paperwork, and let employees — who <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-Oct/CBP%20Publication%201847-0622%20-%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Key%20Changes%2019%20CFR%20111%20Final%20Rule.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legally must be in the United States</a>, meaning companies can’t use off-shore workers — focus on helping customers move their goods across the border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s where the second goal comes in. President Donald Trump’s chaotic trade policy has made customs brokers all the more important, according to Chris Bachinski, CEO of 125-year-old firm GHY International. Bachinski — who is one of Amari’s early adopters — told TechCrunch that many of his own customers don’t even have their own compliance staff. Instead, they look to the brokers like GHY to help figure out how sudden changes in trade policy apply to their goods, especially if they are already in transit.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This chaos has led to burnout across the industry, according to Basu. With the employee base tightly regulated, and a <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/customs-brokers/license-examination-notice-examination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">licensing exam pass rate</a> that hovers around 10% to 20%, “it’s a perfect fit for AI,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Experienced people are leaving the industry or taking early retirement,” Basu said. “So we’re pitching ourselves as these extra set of hands that logistics companies can hire or keep alongside the human expertise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu said Amari’s AI agents constantly monitor trade rules and update their reasoning any time there’s a change, making it easier for brokers to help their customers quickly understand any impact. Previously, these kinds of sudden changes required manual research that would slow down brokers’ ability to clear cargo into the country.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amari does this by building its own AI models trained on more than one million documents related to the shipments it’s already helped clear through customs, though Basu said the company has been leveraging off-the-shelf models to date. He noted some customers do opt out of this training, and that Amari anonymizes the data before feeding it to the models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do not sell their data, and we make sure that their data is theirs,” he said. “They’re very serious about these documents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Todd Jackson, a partner at First Round Capital, attributed Amari’s early success to Basu’s willingness to pound the pavement in order to learn what these brokers need.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He’s going to conferences, he’s going to trade shows, [and] the word of mouth starts to get very strong,” Jackson said in an interview. “It’s an old-school industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was at one of these trade shows — the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, to be precise — that one of Basu’s presentations caught Bachinski’s eye. GHY International is not a mom-and-pop, but it’s also not a Fortune 500 like FedEx; Bachinski has been looking for ways to both stay competitive and grow his company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bachinski said the biggest concern amongst GHY employees so far has been job loss. But he’s told them not to worry. He said he expects tech like Amari’s to help GHY grow, and to focus more on the customer relationships and compliance work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s an old industry, and technology is going to shift our industry faster than I think most customs brokers understand,” he said. And with trade now constantly in the spotlight, he said brokers need to be agile. “I make this joke that last year, the first time in history, our families know what we do for a living. Because all of a sudden, custom brokers became very, very important.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But that equation just doesn’t quite stick. In practice, the impact of AI coding tools on open source software has been far more mixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools have caused as many problems as they have solved, according to industry experts. The easy-to-use and accessible nature of AI coding tools has enabled a flood of bad code that threatens to overwhelm projects. Building new features is easier than ever, but maintaining them is just as hard and threatens to further fragment software ecosystems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is a more complicated story than simple software abundance. Perhaps the predicted, imminent death of the software engineer in this new AI era is premature.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-quality-versus-quantity\">Quality versus quantity</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across the board, projects with open codebases are noticing a decline in the average quality of submissions, likely a result of AI tools lowering barriers to entry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For people who are junior to the VLC codebase, the quality of the merge requests we see is abysmal,” Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.videolan.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the VideoLAN Organization</a> that oversees VLC, said in a recent interview.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kempf is still optimistic about AI coding tools overall but says they’re best “for experienced developers.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been similar problems for <a href=\"https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Blender</a>, a 3D modeling tool that has been maintained as open source since 2002. Blender Foundation CEO Francesco Siddi said LLM-assisted contributions typically “wasted reviewers’ time and affected their motivation.” Blender is still developing an official policy for AI coding tools, but Siddi said they are “neither mandated nor recommended for contributors or core developers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flood of merge requests has gotten so bad that open source developers are building new tools to manage it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, developer Mitchell Hashimoto launched a system that would limit GitHub contributions to “vouched” users, effectively closing the open-door policy for open source software. As Hashimoto put it in the announcement, “AI eliminated the natural barrier to entry that let OSS projects trust by default.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same effect has emerged in bug bounty programs, which give outside researchers an open door to report security vulnerabilities. The open source data transfer program cURL recently <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/curls-daniel-stenberg-ai-is-ddosing-open-source-and-fixing-its-bugs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">halted its bug bounty program</a> after being overwhelmed by what creator Daniel Stenberg described as “AI slop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the old days, someone actually invested a lot of time [in] the security report,” Stenberg said at a recent conference. “There was a built-in friction, but now there’s no effort at all in doing this. The floodgates are open.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s particularly frustrating because many open source projects are also seeing the benefits of AI coding tools. Kempf says it’s made building new modules for VLC far easier, provided there’s an experienced developer at the helm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can give the model the whole codebase of VLC and say, ‘I’m porting this to a new operating system,’” Kempf said. “It is useful for senior people to write new code, but it’s difficult to manage for people who don’t know what they’re doing.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-competing-priorities\">Competing priorities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger problem for open source projects is a difference in priorities. Companies like Meta value new code and products, while open source software work focuses more on stability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The problem is different from large companies to open source projects,” Kempf commented. “They get promoted for writing code, not maintaining it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools are also arriving at a moment when software, in general, is particularly fragmented. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Open source investor Konstantin Vinogradov says AI tools are running into a long-standing trend in open source engineering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On the one hand, we have exponentially growing code base with exponentially growing number of interdependences, And on the other hand, we have number of active maintainers, which is maybe slowly growing, but definitely not keeping up,” Vinogradov said. “With AI, both parts of this equation accelerated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a new way of thinking about AI’s impact on software engineering — one with alarming implications for the industry at large. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you see engineering as the process of producing working software, AI coding makes it easier than ever. But if engineering is really the process of managing software complexity, AI coding tools could make it harder. At the very least, it will take a lot of active planning and work to keep the sprawling complexity in check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Vinogradov, the result is a familiar situation for open source projects: a lot of work to do, and not enough good engineers to do it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI does not increase the number of active, skilled maintainers,” he remarked. “It empowers the good ones, but all the fundamental problems just remain.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
