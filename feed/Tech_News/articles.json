Meanwhile, Lightman quietly worked on a team teaching OpenAI’s models to solve high school math competitions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today that team, known as MathGen, is considered instrumental to OpenAI’s industry-leading effort to create AI reasoning models: the core technology behind AI agents that can do tasks on a computer like a human would.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were trying to make the models better at mathematical reasoning, which at the time they weren’t very good at,” Lightman told TechCrunch, describing MathGen’s early work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s models are far from perfect today — the company’s latest AI systems <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/\">still hallucinate</a> and its agents <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/browser-haunted-by-ai-agents/\">struggle with complex tasks.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But its state-of-the-art models have improved significantly on mathematical reasoning. One of OpenAI’s models recently won a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/openai-and-google-outdo-the-mathletes-but-not-each-other/\">gold medal </a>at the International Math Olympiad, a math competition for the world’s brightest high school students. OpenAI believes these reasoning capabilities will translate to other subjects, and ultimately power general-purpose agents that the company has always dreamed of building.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT was a happy accident — a lowkey research preview turned viral consumer business — but OpenAI’s agents are the product of a years-long, deliberate effort within the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Eventually, you’ll just ask the computer for what you need and it’ll do all of these tasks for you,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/everything-announced-at-openais-first-developer-event/\">first developer conference</a> in 2023. “These capabilities are often talked about in the AI field as agents.

Less than a year later, the 21 foundational researchers behind that breakthrough are the most highly sought-after talent in Silicon Valley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/meta-hires-key-openai-researcher-to-work-on-ai-reasoning-models/\">recruited</a> five of the o1 researchers to work on Meta’s new superintelligence-focused unit, offering some compensation packages north of $100 million.

RL provides feedback to an AI model on whether its choices were correct or not in simulated environments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RL has been used for decades. For instance, in 2016, about a year after OpenAI was founded in 2015, an AI system created by Google DeepMind using RL, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/google-ai-beats-go-world-champion-again-to-complete-historic-4-1-series-victory/\">AlphaGo</a>, gained global attention after beating a world champion in the board game, Go.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033346\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=430,276 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=720,462 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=900,578 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=800,513 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=668,429 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=584,375 584w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=962,617 962w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=708,454 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">South Korean professional Go player Lee Se-Dol (R) prepares for his fourth match against Google’s artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo, during the Google DeepMind Challenge Match on March 13, 2016 in Seoul, South Korea.

But it would take years for OpenAI to develop the necessary models and training techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2018, OpenAI pioneered its first large language model in the GPT series, pretrained on massive amounts of internet data and a large clusters of GPUs. GPT models excelled at text processing, eventually leading to ChatGPT, but struggled with basic math. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took until 2023 for OpenAI to achieve a breakthrough, initially dubbed “Q*” and then “Strawberry,” by combining LLMs, RL, and a technique called test-time computation. The latter gave the models extra time and computing power to plan and work through problems, verifying its steps, before providing an answer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This allowed OpenAI to introduce a new approach called “chain-of-thought” (CoT), which improved AI’s performance on math questions the models hadn’t seen before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I could see the model starting to reason,” said El Kishky. “It would notice mistakes and backtrack, it would get frustrated. It really felt like reading the thoughts of a person.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though individually these techniques weren’t novel, OpenAI uniquely combined them to create Strawberry, which directly led to the development of o1. OpenAI quickly identified that the planning and fact checking abilities of AI reasoning models could be useful to power AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We had solved a problem that I had been banging my head against for a couple of years,” said Lightman. “It was one of the most exciting moments of my research career.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scaling-reasoning\">Scaling reasoning</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With AI reasoning models, OpenAI determined it had two new axes that would allow it to improve AI models: using more computational power during the post-training of AI models, and giving AI models more time and processing power while answering a question.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI, as a company, thinks a lot about not just the way things are, but the way things are going to scale,” said Lightman.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after the 2023 Strawberry breakthrough, OpenAI spun up an “Agents” team led by OpenAI researcher Daniel Selsam to make further progress on this new paradigm, two sources told TechCrunch. Although the team was called “Agents,”  OpenAI didn’t initially differentiate between reasoning models and agents as we think of them today. The company just wanted to make AI systems capable of completing complex tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, the work of Selsam’s Agents team became part of a larger project to develop the o1 reasoning model, with leaders including OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, chief research officer Mark Chen, and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Ilya Sutskever, Russian Israeli-Canadian computer scientist and co-founder and Chief Scientist of OpenAI.\" class=\"wp-image-2797714\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Ilya Sutskever, Russian Israeli-Canadian computer scientist and co-founder and Chief Scientist of OpenAI, speaks at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv on June 5, 2023.

Throughout OpenAI’s history, researchers have had to negotiate with company leaders to obtain resources; demonstrating breakthroughs was a surefire way to secure them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the core components of OpenAI is that everything in research is bottom up,” said Lightman. “When we showed the evidence [for o1], the company was like, ‘This makes sense, let’s push on it.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some former employees say that the startup’s mission to develop AGI was the key factor in achieving breakthroughs around AI reasoning models. By focusing on developing the smartest-possible AI models, rather than products, OpenAI was able to prioritize o1 above other efforts. That type of large investment in ideas wasn’t always possible at competing AI labs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to try new training methods proved prescient. By late 2024, several leading AI labs started seeing<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/ai-scaling-laws-are-showing-diminishing-returns-forcing-ai-labs-to-change-course/\"> diminishing returns</a> on models created through traditional pretraining scaling. Today, much of the AI field’s momentum comes from advances in reasoning models.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-it-mean-for-an-ai-to-reason\"><strong>What does it mean for an AI to “reason?”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, the goal of AI research is to recreate human intelligence with computers. Since the launch of o1, ChatGPT’s UX has been filled with more human-sounding features such as “thinking” and “reasoning.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked whether OpenAI’s models were truly reasoning, El Kishky hedged, saying he thinks about the concept in terms of computer science. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re teaching the model how to efficiently expend compute to get an answer. So if you define it that way, yes, it is reasoning,” said El Kishky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightman takes the approach of focusing on the model’s results and not as much on the means or their relation to human brains.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"The OpenAI logo on screen at their developer day stage.\" class=\"wp-image-2625161\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=1200,802 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=1280,855 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=900,601 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=561,375 561w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=924,617 924w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The OpenAI logo on screen at their developer day stage.

Other AI researchers tend to agree.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nathan Lambert, an AI researcher with the non-profit AI2, compares AI reasoning modes to airplanes in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-rise-of-reasoning-machines\">blog post</a>. Both, he says, are manmade systems inspired by nature — human reasoning and bird flight, respectively — but they operate through entirely different mechanisms. That doesn’t make them any less useful, or any less capable of achieving similar outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A group of AI researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind agreed in a recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/research-leaders-urge-tech-industry-to-monitor-ais-thoughts/\">position paper</a> that AI reasoning models are not well understood today, and more research is needed. It may be too early to confidently claim what exactly is going on inside them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-next-frontier-ai-agents-for-subjective-tasks\"><strong>The next frontier: AI agents for subjective tasks</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI agents on the market today work best for well-defined, verifiable domains such as coding. OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/openai-launches-codex-an-ai-coding-agent-in-chatgpt/\">Codex agent</a> aims to help software engineers offload simple coding tasks. Meanwhile, Anthropic’s models have become particularly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">popular</a> in AI coding tools like Cursor and Claude Code — these are some of the first AI agents that people are willing to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">pay up for</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, general purpose AI agents like OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt/\">ChatGPT Agent</a> and Perplexity’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Comet</a> struggle with many of the complex, subjective tasks people want to automate. When trying to use these tools for online shopping or finding a long-term parking spot, I’ve found the agents take longer than I’d like and make <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/openais-operator-agent-helped-me-move-but-i-had-to-help-it-too/?_thumbnail_id=2593103\">silly mistakes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents are, of course, early systems that will undoubtedly improve. But researchers must first figure out how to better train the underlying models to complete tasks that are more subjective.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033358\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg 8256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">AI applications (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like many problems in machine learning, it’s a data problem,” said Lightman, when asked about the limitations of agents on subjective tasks. “Some of the research I’m really excited about right now is figuring out how to train on less verifiable tasks. We have some leads on how to do these things.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Noam Brown, an OpenAI researcher who helped create the IMO model and o1, told TechCrunch that OpenAI has new general-purpose RL techniques which allow them to teach AI models skills that aren’t easily verified. This was how the company built the model which achieved a gold medal at IMO, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s IMO model was a newer AI system that spawns multiple agents, which then simultaneously explore several ideas, and then choose the best possible answer. These types of AI models are becoming more popular; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/google-rolls-out-gemini-deep-think-ai-a-reasoning-model-that-tests-multiple-ideas-in-parallel/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/\">xAI</a> have recently released state-of-the-art models using this technique.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think these models will become more capable at math, and I think they’ll get more capable in other reasoning areas as well,” said Brown. “The progress has been incredibly fast. I don’t see any reason to think it will slow down.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These techniques may help OpenAI’s models become more performant, gains that could show up in the company’s upcoming GPT-5 model. OpenAI hopes to assert its dominance over competitors with the launch of GPT-5, ideally offering the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-openais-rocky-path-gpt-5?rc=dp0mql\">best AI model</a> to power agents for developers and consumers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the company also wants to make its products simpler to use. El Kishky says OpenAI wants to develop AI agents that intuitively understand what users want, without requiring them to select specific settings. He says OpenAI aims to build AI systems that understand when to call up certain tools, and how long to reason for.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These ideas paint a picture of an ultimate version of ChatGPT: an agent that can do anything on the internet for you, and understand how you want it to be done. That’s a much different product than what ChatGPT is today, but the company’s research is squarely headed in this direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI undoubtedly led the AI industry a few years ago, the company now faces a tranche of worthy opponents. The question is no longer just whether OpenAI can deliver its agentic future, but can the company do so before Google, Anthropic, xAI, or Meta beat them to it?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Murray, a commercial model herself, said it made her feel sad and exhausted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iconic denim company had teamed up with the AI studio Lalaland.ai to create “diverse” digital fashion models for more inclusive ads. For an industry that has failed for years to employ diverse human models, the backlash was swift, with New York Magazine calling the decision “<a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2023/03/levis-ai-models-diversity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">artificial diversity</a>.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Modeling as a profession is already challenging enough without having to compete with now new digital standards of perfection that can be achieved with AI,” Murray told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two years later, her worries have compounded. Brands continue to experiment with AI-generated models, to the consternation of many fashion lovers. The latest uproar came after Vogue’s July print edition featured a Guess ad with a typical model for the brand: thin yet voluptuous, glossy blond tresses, pouty rose lips. She exemplified North American beauty standards, but there was one problem — she was AI generated. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lala4an/video/7529605769386364191\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The internet buzzed for days</a>, in large part because the AI-generated beauty showed up in Vogue, the fashion bible that dictates what is and is not acceptable in the industry. The AI-generated model was featured in an advertisement, <em>not</em> a Vogue editorial spread. And Vogue told TechCrunch the ad met its advertising standards.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To many, an ad versus an editorial is a distinction without a difference. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch spoke to fashion models, experts, and technologists to get a sense of where the industry is headed now that Vogue seems to have put a stamp of approval on technology that’s poised to dramatically change the fashion industry. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They said the Guess ad drama highlights questions arising within creative industries being touched by AI’s silicon fingers: When high-quality creative work can be done by AI in a fraction of the time and cost, what’s the point of humans? And in the world of fashion, what happens to the humans — the models, photographers, stylists, and set designers — performing those jobs? </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-just-so-much-cheaper\">“It’s just so much cheaper”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sinead Bovell, a model and founder of the <a href=\"http://www.wayetalks.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WAYE</a> organization who <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/sinead-bovell-model-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote about CGI models for Vogue</a> five years ago, told TechCrunch that “e-commerce models” are most under threat of automation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">E-commerce models are the ones who pose for advertisements or display clothes and accessories for online shoppers. Compared to high-fashion models, whose striking, often unattainable looks are featured in editorial spreads and on runways, they’re more realistic and relatable.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“E-commerce is where most models make their bread and butter,” Bovell said. “It’s not necessarily the path to model fame or model prestige, but it is the path for financial security.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?w=584\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033586\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=129,150 129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=258,300 258w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=768,894 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=584,680 584w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=1030,1200 1030w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=1099,1280 1099w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=369,430 369w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=618,720 618w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=773,900 773w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=687,800 687w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=574,668 574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=322,375 322w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=530,617 530w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=456,531 456w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=43,50 43w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">sinead bovell, founder &amp; model </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sinead Bovell</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That fact is running in direct contrast to the pressure many brands feel to automate such shoots. Paul Mouginot, an art technologist who has worked with luxury brands, said it’s simply expensive to work with live models, especially when it comes to photographing them in countless garments, shoes, and accessories. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI now lets you start with a flat-lay product shoot, place it on a photorealistic virtual model, and even position that model in a coherent setting, producing images that look like genuine fashion editorials,” he told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brands, in some ways, have been doing this for a while, he said. Mouginot, who is French, cited the French retailer Veepee as an example of a company that has used virtual mannequins to sell clothes since at least 2013. Other notable brands like <a href=\"https://hmgroup.com/news/hm-continues-its-exploration-of-creativity-with-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">H&amp;M</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mangofashiongroup.com/en/w/mango-crea-la-primera-campa%C3%B1a-generada-con-inteligencia-artificial-para-su-l%C3%ADnea-teen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mango</a>, and Calvin Klein have also resorted to AI models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amy Odell, <a href=\"https://www.amyodell.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a fashion writer</a> and author of a recently published <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Gwyneth/Amy-Odell/9781668005774\">biography on </a><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Gwyneth/Amy-Odell/9781668005774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, put it more simply: “It’s just so much cheaper for [brands] to use AI models now. Brands need a lot of content, and it just adds up. So if they can save money on their print ad or their TikTok feed, they will.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PJ Pereira, co-founder of AI ad firm <a href=\"https://www.silverside.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Silverside AI</a>, said it really comes down to scale. Every conversation he’s had with fashion brands circles around the fact that the entire marketing system was built for a world where brands produced just four big pieces of content per year. Social media and e-commerce has changed that, and now they need anywhere from 400 to 400,000 pieces; it’s too expensive for brands, especially small ones, to keep up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s no way to scale from four to 400 or 400,000 with just process tweaks,” he added. “You need a new system.

That was the main problem with the Levi’s ad. Rather than hiring diverse talent, it artificially generated it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bovell calls this “robot cultural appropriation,” or the idea that brands can just generate certain, especially diverse, identities to tell a brand story, even if the person who created the technology isn’t of that same identity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And though Pereira argues that it’s unrealistic to shoot every garment on every type of model, that hasn’t calmed the fears many diverse models have about what’s to come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We already see an unprecedented use of certain terms in our contracts that we worry indicate that we are possibly signing away our rights for a brand to use our face and anything recognizable as ourselves to train their future AI systems,” Murray said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some see generating likenesses of models as a way forward in the AI era. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/19/style/sara-ziff-fashion-workers-act-model-alliance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sara Ziff</a>, a former model and founder of the Model Alliance, is working to pass the <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S2477/amendment/C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fashion Workers Act</a>, which would require brands to get a model’s clear consent and provide compensation for using their digital replicas. Mouginot said this lets models appear at several shoots on the same day and possibly generate additional income. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s “precious when a sought-after model is already traveling constantly,” he continued. But at the same time, whenever an avatar is hired, human labor is replaced. “What few players gain can mean fewer opportunities for many others.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If anything, Bovell said the bar is now higher for models looking to compete with the distinctive and the digitized. She suggested that models use their platforms to build their personal brands, differentiate themselves, and work on new revenue streams like podcasting or brand endorsements. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Start to take those opportunities to tell your unique human story,” she said. “AI will never have a unique human story.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sort of entrepreneurial mindset is becoming table stakes across industries — from journalism to coding — as AI creates the conditions for the most self-directed learners to rise. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-room-for-another-view-nbsp\">Room for another view </h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033535\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg 2062w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=150,145 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=300,291 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=768,744 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=680,659 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=1200,1163 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=1280,1240 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=430,417 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=720,698 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=900,872 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=800,775 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=1536,1488 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=2048,1984 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=668,647 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=387,375 387w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=637,617 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=548,531 548w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=50,48 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Artcare AI-generated model.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Artcare</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mouginot sees a world where some platforms stop working with human models altogether, though he also believes humans share a desire for the “sensual reality of objects, for a touch of imperfection and for human connection.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many breakthrough models succeed precisely because of a distinctive trait, teeth, gaze, attitude, that is slightly imperfect by strict standards yet utterly charming,” he said. “Such nuances are hard to erode in zeros and ones.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is where startup and creative studio <a href=\"https://artcare.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Artcare</a> thrives, according to Sandrine Decorde, the firm’s CEO and co-founder. She refers to her team as “AI artisans,” creative people who use tools like Flux from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/black-forest-labs-kontext-ai-models-can-edit-pics-as-well-as-generate-them/\">Black Forest Labs</a> to fine-tune AI-generated models that have that touch of unique humanity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the work Decorde’s firm does today involves producing AI-generated babies and children for brands. Employing minors in the fashion industry has historically been a gray area rife with exploitation and abuse. Ethically, Decorde argues, bringing generative AI to children’s fashion makes sense, particularly when the market demand is so high. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s like sewing; it’s very delicate,” she told TechCrunch, referring to creating AI-generated models. “The more time we spend on our datasets and image refinements, the better and more consistent our models are.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033501\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png 1682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=300,266 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=768,680 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=680,602 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=1200,1063 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=1280,1134 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=430,381 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=720,638 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=900,797 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=800,709 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=1536,1361 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=668,592 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=423,375 423w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=697,617 697w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=599,531 599w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Screenshot from Seraphinne Vallora’s Instagram page.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Seraphinne Vallora</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the work is building out a library of distinctive artifacts. Decorde noted that many AI-generated models — like the ones created by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMJ3Utyotaf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Seraphinne Vallora</a>, the agency behind Vogue’s Guess ad — are too homogenous. Their lips are too perfect and symmetrical. Their jawlines are all the same. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Imagery needs to make an impact,” Decorde said, noting that many fashion brands like to work exclusively with certain models, a desire that has spilled over into AI-generated models. “A model embodies a fashion brand.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pereira added that his firm combats homogeneity in AI “with intention” and warned that as more content gets made by more people who aren’t intentional, all of the output feeds back into computer models, amplifying bias. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just like you would cast for a wide range of models, you have to prompt for that,” he said. “You need to train [models] with a wide range of appearances. Because if you don’t, the AI will reflect whatever biases it was trained on.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-future-is-promised-but-uncertain-nbsp\">An AI future is promised, but uncertain </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The usage of AI modeling technology in fashion is mostly still in its experimental phase, Claudia Wagner, founder of modeling booking platform Ubooker, told TechCrunch.

Pereira said his firm recently tested a fully AI-generated product video on TikTok that got more than a million views with mostly negative comments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But if you look past the comments, you see that there’s a silent majority — almost 20x engagement — that vastly outnumber the criticism,” he continued. “The click-through rate was 30x the number of complaints, and the product saw a steep hike in sales.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He, like Wagner, doesn’t think AI models are going away anytime soon. If anything, the process of using AI will be integrated into the creative workflow. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some brands feel good about using fully artificial models,” Pereira said. “Others prefer starting with real people and licensing their likeness to build synthetic shoots. And some brands simply don’t want to do it — they worry their audiences won’t accept it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wagner said what is becoming evident is that human talent remains central, especially when authenticity and identity are part of a brand’s story. That’s especially true for luxury heritage brands, which are usually slow to adopt new technologies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Decorde noted many high-fashion brands are quietly experimenting with AI, Mouginot said many are still trying to define their AI policies and are avoiding fully AI-generated people at the moment. It’s one reason why Vogue’s inclusion of an AI model was such a shock. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bovell pondered if the ad was Vogue’s way of testing how the world would react to merging high fashion with AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far the reaction hasn’t been great. It’s unclear if the magazine thinks it ride out the backlash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What Vogue does matters,” Odell said. “If Vogue ends up doing editorials with AI models, I think that’s going to make it okay. In the same way the industry was really resistant to Kim Kardashian and then Vogue featured her. Then it was okay.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While Adobe cited the lack of a “clear path” to approval from the European Commission and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, the acquisition also faced regulatory scrutiny in the United States over concerns that it could prevent Figma from being an “effective competitor” to Adobe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khan was FTC chair at the time, leading the agency to challenge Big Tech on fronts including startup acquisitions — to the point that companies tried to avoid this scrutiny with “reverse acqui-hires” in which they hired key team members and licensed technology rather than acquiring startups outright. (The practice <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/19/windsurf-ceo-opens-up-about-very-bleak-mood-before-cognition-deal/\">seems to be continuing</a> despite Khan’s departure from the FTC.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While her aggressive stance led to intense criticism from corners of the tech industry, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/15/ftc-chair-lina-khan-on-startups-scaling-and-innovations-in-potential-law-breaking/\">she defended her approach</a> by saying that only a tiny percentage of deals received “a second look” and arguing that founders would ultimately benefit from “a world in which you have six or seven or eight potential suitors” rather than “just one or two.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And although Khan — who’d been appointed by President Joe Biden — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-ftc-chair-khan-resign-commission-coming-weeks-2025-01-20/\">resigned at the start</a> of the second Trump administration, her comments Friday paint the Figma IPO as a vindication for her approach, calling the IPO “a win for employees, investors, innovation, and the public.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, Khan’s critics are more likely to see Figma’s success as coming despite regulatory scrutiny, not because of it. For example, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/lina-kahn-victory-lap-figma-ipo-after-fighting-adobe-merger-2025-8\">told Business Insider</a>, “Figma is a massive success, but it’s because of the company’s innovative growth and not due to the FTC and [Khan].”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cathy-Gao.jpg?resize=1200,800",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startup founders face a perplexing and even contradictory capital market in 2025, according to Sapphire Ventures partner Cathy Gao. “Capital isn’t scarce. But access to that capital is harder than ever,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gao, who spoke at TechCrunch’s All Stage conference in July, said it’s possible for startup founders, especially those in later Series C stage, to navigate this particular economic environment. And they need to start with a reality check. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To begin, she said, it’s important to note that only one in five startups that raise a Series A ever make it to raise a Series C. And, in the past year, the bar for raising late-stage capital has only risen; investors are no longer just chasing momentum, as many were in the last few years — they are chasing <em>certainty</em>, Gao said.<em> </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Investors are now asking: ‘Is this company truly a winner in whatever market that they’re serving?’” Gao said. “The question really isn’t, ‘is this company growing?’ The question has shifted to, ‘is this company on a trajectory where the upside is really undeniable?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies raising Series C rounds should meet certain criteria. For one, they’re all category leaders, according to Gao. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re defining their categories. They have clear go-to-market and undeniable pull,” she said. “In short, they’re growing efficiently, but there’s also traction to show that these are truly the market leaders in the spaces that they operate in.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies looking to raise a Series C should also remember that metrics do not always equal money. Sure, metrics are important, as are annual returns, growth, and retention, she said, but if investors are not sold on the idea that a company can truly become a leader in their respective space, then they are going to move on. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Investors have to explain why a company will win in the future,” she continued. For example, there are companies that don’t have amazing metrics yet somehow raise a suitable Series C round. In one case, a startup nabbed more than a $2 billion valuation, she noted. “They were effectively able to communicate the story to investors why this company will be a leading company over time,” Gao said of the company’s successful raise.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another Gao rule: continuity is better than short-term virility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the age of AI, companies are growing faster than investors have ever seen before, she noted. “But oftentimes it’s the case, what goes up also sharply comes down,”Gao said. “So the question is, ‘is this growth sustainable?’” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a Series C, investors are looking for “compounding loops,” or seeing that the company gets stronger as it scales, she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Does your product get better for every new customer you sign? Does your CAC [customer acquisition cost] decrease or increase for every new user you bring on board?,” she asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the answer is yes, then investors will “lean in,” Gao said; if the answer is “no,” then investors are most likely to “lean out,” even if a company’s metrics look very strong. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, she said, founders should treat fundraising like a go-to-market campaign and seek to develop relationships with VCs before pitching them for capital. Gao cited her firm as an example. Sapphire likes to invest in a company at the Series B level, but they usually have known the company for a year or longer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That means at the Series A, even though we’re not actively leaning in to try and raise, we’re trying to build a relationship with a company and with the founder,” she said. “We’re getting information and we’re developing a longitudinal picture of how this company has progressed.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She said founders should start building a “lightweight investor CRM,” or a database managing the relationships with investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors take notes while meeting with founders, and founders should do the same, she said. Founders should write down the names of partners, what they like to invest in, and what companies they’ve backed recently. Create a distribution list and send out periodic updates to the investors on it, she said. “This is an easy way to keep inventors in the loop.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps most importantly, however, Gao noted that a company looking to raise a Series C should not enter a fundraise until they’ve received a signal from multiple firms that they’re interested in backing the round. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The last thing you want to do is time the market incorrectly,” she said. After all, timing is everything at the Series C level. “It’s not about luck, pitching to a 50 and hoping that one says yes,” she continued. “It’s really about timing and planning ahead.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just for fun, we’ve calculated the value of Kleiner Perkins’ stake in each company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kleiner sold 1,346,499 shares of Figma at the IPO price of $33, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025037014/figma424b4.htm#i8dccdb6f4d824d4aba81e7c665eaa62d_148\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Figma disclosed</a>, and could have sold as many as 2,756,020 shares at that price if the bankers exercised their option to nab additional shares. Given how much <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/figmas-ipo-price-hit-a-19-3b-valuation-out-of-the-gate/\">demand outstripped supply for shares of Figma</a>, we’re going to assume the bankers will snap up the full tranche (or they already have).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Kleiner still holds 52,364,374 shares of Figma, the company says. Share prices are still fluctuating wildly in heavy trading on Day 2, from about $110 to over $142, but closed Day 1 at $115, so we’ll use that number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Figma: An estimated $91 million returned from share sales and a remaining stake worth more than $6 billion (2,756,02 shares at $33 = $90,948,660, and 52,364,374 shares at $115 = $6,021,903,010). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For perspective, this stake in Figma alone is worth 3x the last mega-funds the firm raised, which was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/28/kleiner-perkins-announces-2-billion-in-fresh-capital-showing-that-established-firms-can-still-raise-large-sums/\">$2 billion across two vehicles in 2024</a>.

Kleiner holds 2,081,831 shares, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500412/000119312525169401/d377490d424b4.htm#rom377490_14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the company disclosed</a>. Shares are still trading at a premium to the IPO price as of Friday and closed Thursday at $43.85. So we’ll use that price.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ambiq stake: $91.3 million (2,081,831 at $43.85 = $91,288,289).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But wait! There’s more. Kleiner is also having a good month and possibly year (Kleiner has declined comment for this story).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm reportedly scored a decent return earlier this month as part of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\">Google’s deal to license tech from Windsurf</a> and hire away its top talent.

But TechCrunch’s Marina Temkin reports the total return was about 3x the original funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And at least one more Kleiner-backed company is waiting in the wings to IPO. Fleet tracking startup Motive Technologies raised $150 million led by Kleiner Perkins, with Ilya Fushman joining the board, the company <a href=\"https://gomotive.com/ai-leader-motive-raises-150-million-to-invest-in-product-go-to-market-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> this week.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A jury in federal court in Miami has found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash that involved the use of the company’s Autopilot driver assistance system. <br><br>The jury assessed punitive damages only against Tesla, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/tesla-must-pay-329-million-in-damages-in-fatal-autopilot-case.html\">CNBC reported.</a> The punitive fines coupled with a compensatory damages puts the total payments to around $242.5 million. The plaintiff’s attorney confirmed to TechCrunch that this is the correct amount. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neither the driver of the car nor the Autopilot system braked in time to avoid going through an intersection, where the car struck an SUV and killed a pedestrian. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame, and attributed one-third to Tesla. (The driver was sued separately.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The verdict comes at the end of a three-week trial over the crash, which killed 20-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured her boyfriend Dillon Angulo. The verdict is one of the first major legal decisions about driver assistance technology that has gone against Tesla. The company has previously settled lawsuits <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-17/tesla-settled-over-autopilot-crash-with-truck-crossing-highway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">involving similar claims about Autopilot</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brett Schreiber, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement to TechCrunch that Tesla designed Autopilot “only for controlled access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside Elon Musk telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Tesla’s lies turned our roads into test tracks for their fundamentally flawed technology, putting everyday Americans like Naibel Benavides and Dillon Angulo in harm’s way,” said Schreiber. “Today’s verdict represents justice for Naibel’s tragic death and Dillon’s lifelong injuries, holding Tesla and Musk accountable for propping up the company’s trillion-dollar valuation with self-driving hype at the expense of human lives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla, in a statement provided to TechCrunch, said it plans to appeal the verdict “given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today’s verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire industry’s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,” the company wrote. “To be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash. This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs’ lawyers blaming the car when the driver — from day one — admitted and accepted responsibility.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla and Musk spent years making claims about Autopilot’s capabilities that have led to overconfidence in the driver assistance system, a reality that government officials — and Musk himself — have spoken about for years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) came to this determination in 2020 after investigating a 2018 crash where the driver died after hitting a concrete barrier. That driver, Walter Huang, was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">playing a mobile game while using Autopilot</a>. The NTSB made a number of recommendations following that investigation, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/tesla-criticized-for-not-responding-to-accident-investigators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tesla largely ignored</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/tesla-criticized-for-not-responding-to-accident-investigators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">safety board later claimed</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a 2018 conference call, Musk said “complacency” with driver assistance systems like Autopilot is a problem. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It’s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It’s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do,” Musk <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17313324/tesla-autopilot-safety-statistics-elon-musk-q1-earnings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said at the time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The trial took place at a time when Tesla is currently in the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/22/tesla-launches-robotaxi-rides-in-austin-with-big-promises-and-unanswered-questions/\">middle of rolling out the first versions of its long-promised Robotaxi network</a>, starting in Austin, Texas. Those vehicles are using an enhanced version of Tesla’s more capable driver assistance system, which it calls Full Self-Driving.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: This story has been updated to include the amount of compensatory damages in the total</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Aptos Labs and King River Capital, as well as existing backers General Catalyst and GFR Fund, also participated. Google joined the round via its <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/ai-futures-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Futures Fund</a>, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/google-launches-new-initiative-to-back-startups-building-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched</a> in May to support startups building with its AI tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">STAN, headquartered in Singapore, is trying to position itself as a gaming community platform to rival Discord, but its approach to the market is quite different. STAN lets users earn in-app currency called “Gems” by winning games like Krafton’s Battlegrounds Mobile India, Garena’s Free Fire Max, Minecraft, Call of Duty, or casual titles like Ludo and Snakes &amp; Ladders. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app also lets creators set up chat rooms called Clubs, which are channels tailored for each game on the platform. While anyone can join these Clubs, they need to pay a social currency to access the “gaming experiences” that creators offer. The startup takes a commission from these transactions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The primary attraction seems to be the in-app currency, however, as it can be redeemed for vouchers on various e-commerce platforms like Amazon, PhonePe, and Flipkart. Users can also earn currency via referrals, a spin-to-win wheel, and daily rewards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It appears STAN’s monetization model is what sets it apart: Users can earn rewards through interactions, unlike on Discord, where chatting or participating in communities doesn’t earn users much, apart from clout.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, STAN wants to shadow Discord. The company claims it has already garnered over 25 million downloads on the Play Store and App Store altogether, and it has around 5.5 million monthly active users.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3032909\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=1200,813 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=1280,867 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=430,291 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=720,488 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=900,609 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=800,542 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=1536,1040 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=668,452 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=554,375 554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=911,617 911w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=708,479 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stan-communities.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>STAN</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“STAN is the hangout place for gamers. It’s a place where gamers come and make friends, play with each other, talk to each other, sort of a fusion of social and gaming,” said Parth Chadha, co-founder and CEO of STAN, in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chadha credits the platform’s features for its traction so far. Initially, creators had to contact the company’s team to start streaming, but last year, the startup opened the platform to user-generated content, allowing anyone to go live. That shift helped drive both downloads and engagement, the CEO said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">STAN also works with game publishers, studios, and developers, including Krafton, Garena, and Roblox, who pay the startup to connect them with gamers and creators on the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chadha told TechCrunch that in the past two quarters, nearly 100 game publishers, studios, and developers have joined the platform, and it is bringing more than 20 on board each month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That is turning into a very interesting business stream as we speak,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, STAN plans to leverage Google’s backing to use AI to improve moderation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently 70% to 80% of moderation on STAN is already handled by AI, Chadha said. A human moderation team manages the rest, but the startup plans to reduce that further by using AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, STAN aims to bring AI-powered toolkits for creators, including the ability to produce avatars and memes, as well as tools for quick replies and filtering out chats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are a lot of interesting plug-and-play models, which we and the Google team are working together to leverage and scale the business,” he stated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">STAN isn’t the first Indian startup to be backed by Google’s AI Futures Fund. That distinction goes to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/google-back-toonsutra-to-grow-its-webtoons-platform-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Toonsutra</a>, a startup using AI to power an <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/showcase/toonsutra-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">immersive comic-reading experience</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it has invested over $5.5 billion in India to date, including in startups Toonsutra, STAN, Pixxel, and Adda247.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although STAN’s app is currently geo-restricted to India, the platform still sees 5% to 6% of its engagement coming from users abroad, who often access it using Indian phone numbers and accounts. Over the next year, the startup plans to expand internationally, starting with the Indian subcontinent, and will later target Southeast Asia and Latin America.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup was profitable for a few months, the CEO said, but decided to spend some money to scale. Now it aims to achieve profitability in 2027, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, the startup employs about 40 people; less than 30 of them work in product engineering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this raise, STAN’s total equity funding now stands at around $15 million.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Investors’ portion was $1.2 billion. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other half was in the form of compensation packages for approximately 40 Windsurf employees hired by the tech giant with a substantial portion of that $1.2 billion going to the startup’s co-founders, Varun Mohan and Douglas Chen, sources say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transaction was a good outcome for VCs, which included Greenoaks, Kleiner Perkins, and General Catalyst. Windsurf raised a total of<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/29/github-copilot-competitor-codeium-raises-150m-at-a-1-25b-valuation/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIPGM74cjyhn17CNsmCgnDNzzKGDMxRseNOBsAhfAgZoU4-PDlvd5NyIlKa5U1xiafmpo9PxmZYTEeLdtNcciqH-P6gh7d035_abthiNmhPJv3B_9R2mm1G8lP2bvLC1anMRuI8MJO8101I3pkvOin5Zv-v8q9WCliKseRDKPbN9\"> about $243 million</a> as of its last raise in 2024 that valued the company at $1.25 billion, which means the total return to investors was about 4x their original funding. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Greenoaks, which led Windsurf’s seed and Series A financings and owned 20% of the company, returned about $500 million on their $65 million investment in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Kleiner Perkins, which led Windsurf’s Series B, returned about 3x its invested capital, according to another person familiar with the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, Kleiner Perkins, and Greenoaks declined to comment. General Catalyst, Varun Mohan, and Douglas Chen didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even so, most investors were aiming for a more significant win from the company.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February, TechCrunch reported that Kleiner Perkins was in talks to lead a fresh round of funding, valuing the startup, which was then known as Codeium, at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/19/ai-coding-startup-codeium-in-talks-to-raise-at-an-almost-3b-valuation-sources-say/\">$2.85 billion</a>. That deal didn’t happen, according to a person familiar with the matter, because Windsurf had instead agreed to be purchased by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-is-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-windsurf-for-3b-with-news-expected-later-this-week/\">OpenAI for $3 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As we all know now, the OpenAI acquisition unraveled and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\">Google swooped in</a> with its deal structured to offer investor returns and obtain talent and IP without acquiring stock. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s rattling the Valley is this: While Google’s deal was good for the co-founders and VCs, it didn’t benefit a large portion of Windsurf’s approximately 250 employees, especially after they were expecting a payout from the sale to OpenAI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a typical acquisition, employees would get money for the shares they owned and would often have <a href=\"https://www.irisglobal.com/blog/single-trigger-vs-double-trigger-accelerated-vesting/#:~:text=Single%20Trigger%20Acceleration&amp;text=This%20single%20trigger%20must%20be,the%20completion%20of%20the%20M%26A.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">their vesting schedule accelerated</a>. However, Windsurf employees who were hired over the last year didn’t receive a payout from the deal, these people said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Google deal was especially unsettling to approximately 200 Windsurf employees not hired by the search giant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of siphoning every penny of Google’s payment into their own pockets, investors opted to leave the company with over $100 million in capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One source says this was entirely funded by VCs, meaning their total payout was about $1.1 billion. However, another person said that the founders equally chipped in to leave the company with a nest egg from the Google payment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Multiple people said that the money left for the company would have been sufficient to pay all remaining employees proceeds at the Google deal’s per-share valuation, regardless of how long they had been with the company.  However, to have done that immediately would have been problematic, leaving the company with less cash to operate and — with founders and key people gone — with no investors ready to finance a new raise. The remaining leadership would likely have had to shut down after making such cash distributions, one of the people said. Meanwhile, another person claimed that the company had enough capital to pay out employees and continue to operate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That difference of opinion is only part of the reason the deal became so controversial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, at least some of the employees Google did hire, despite attractive pay and benefits, saw their stock grants revoked and their vesting timelines restarted. That meant they’d have to wait an additional four years for their total payout in Google stock, according to people familiar with the deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some top VCs condemned the 3-year-old startup’s co-founders for not sharing their windfall with all the people who helped build the company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Windsurf and others are really bad examples of founders leaving their teams behind and not even sharing the proceeds with their team,” wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/vkhosla/status/1946655439921557760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vinod Khosla on X</a>. “I definitely would not work with their founders next time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After several days of limbo following the announcement of the Google deal, Windsurf’s remaining entity, under the leadership of interim CEO Jeff Wang, managed to sell itself to Cognition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cognition acquired Windsurf’s IP and product and brought on all staff not hired by Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the exact deal terms of that sale were not disclosed, the acquisition allowed every employee to financially gain from the sale, according to a <a href=\"https://cognition.ai/blog/windsurf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog published by Cognition</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two other sources estimated to TechCrunch that Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf’s remaining entity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cognition didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

When it raised its seed funding, Fundamental Research Labs was developing bots that could play Minecraft with you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, the company has a games team, a prosumer team building apps, a core research team, and a platform team. The startup’s founder, Dr. Robert Yang, a former faculty member at MIT, says that Fundamental Research Labs wants to be a “historical” company without adhering to a typical startup structure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yang said that the company is already charging users for this agent after a seven-day trial and bringing in revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among the products Fundamental Research Labs offers is a general-purpose consumer assistant called <a href=\"https://fairies.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fairies</a>. This app allows you to chat with an AI bot, connect applications, and ask questions across the knowledge bases of those applications, then ask it to schedule appointments for you on your calendar. The app can schedule workflows for you to repeatedly execute some tasks. Yang said that this app allows the startup’s engineers to test out various capabilities of models and platform tech it is developing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also offers a spreadsheet-based agent called <a href=\"https://www.tryshortcut.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Shortcut</a>, which has been used by analysts for creating different financial models and performing analysis over them. The startup said that this agent works like a junior analyst and can do work autonomously. The company has made it look like Excel and has tried to retain a lot of functionality for power users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve seen many early-stage startups, but what stood out here is a small, highly mission-driven team focused on digital humans with actual use cases. Their recent launches, like Fairies and Shortcut, aren’t just demos; they’re already demonstrating how AI can augment the human workforce in meaningful ways,” Sandeep Bakshi, an investment partner at Prosus, told TechCrunch over email.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What stood out with Fundamental Research Labs is not just the ambition of the vision, but again the caliber of the team driving it,” he added. “Their ability to attract some of the brightest minds in the world, and turn that talent into real-world products, makes this a uniquely compelling venture opportunity for us.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/08/bye-bye-bots-alteras-game-playing-ai-agents-get-backing-from-eric-schmidt/\">$9 million in a seed round last year</a>, which was co-led by First Spark Ventures and Patron, with participation from a16z Speedrun and Eric Schmidt. The startup has raised over $40 million in funding to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yang said the company is open to trying out various application models and eventually wants to build robots as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are working on productivity (apps) now because that is where the most value is created. You can make a lot of money doing this and build your team and tech. Eventually, we want to solve physical problems and move towards working on embodiment,” Yang said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: The funding round was $33 million, not $30 million; the story was updated with the accurate amount. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

When asked by TechCrunch, the company did not respond to clarify whether it was referring to media reports or to a security researcher’s disclosure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Details of the bug emerged this week after a security researcher, who goes by the handle BobDaHacker, disclosed that they <a href=\"https://bobdahacker.com/blog/lovense-still-leaking-user-emails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported the two security bugs</a> to the sex toy maker earlier this year. The researcher published their findings after Lovense claimed it would take 14 months to fully address the vulnerabilities rather than applying a “faster, one-month fix” that would have required alerting users to update their apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovense said in its statement, attributed to Liu, that the fixes put in place will require users to update their apps before they can resume using all of the app’s features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the statement, Liu claimed that there is “no evidence suggesting that any user data, including email addresses or account information, has been compromised or misused.” It’s not clear how Lovense came to this conclusion, given TechCrunch (<a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lovense-sex-toy-app-flaw-leaks-private-user-email-addresses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and other outlets</a>) verified the email disclosure bug by setting up a new account and asking the researcher to identify the associated email address.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch asked Lovense what technical means, such as logs, the company has to determine if there was any compromise of users’ data, but a spokesperson did not respond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not unheard of for organizations to resort to legal demands and threats to try to block the disclosure of embarrassing security incidents, despite few rules or restrictions in the U.S. prohibiting such reporting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, a U.S. independent journalist <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/hacked-health-firm-hcrg-demanded-journalist-take-down-data-breach-reporting-citing-uk-court-order/\">rebuffed a legal threat</a> from a U.K. court injunction for accurately reporting a ransomware attack on U.K. private healthcare giant HCRG. In 2023, a county official in Hillsborough County, Florida, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/30/us-court-records-systems-vulnerabilities-exposed-sealed-documents/\">threatened criminal charges against a security researcher</a> under the state’s computer hacking laws for identifying and privately disclosing a security flaw in the county’s court records system that exposed access to sensitive filings.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Users with saved call recordings can either download them to their devices, share them via email or messaging apps, or switch their storage preference to iCloud to keep the recordings accessible even after the feature is discontinued.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truecaller’s head of iOS, Nakul Kabra, told TechCrunch the company took the decision because it wanted to focus on its Live Caller ID and automatic spam-blocking features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2023, Truecaller launched call recording on iOS for its paying subscribers, alongside reintroducing the feature on Android. The app also got support for transcribing calls natively. Both call recording and transcription were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/25/truecaller-brings-call-recording-and-transcription-to-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched</a> in India last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While call recording works seamlessly on Android, it is more complicated on iOS, where Apple’s operating system does not let third-party apps record calls natively. To work around this, Truecaller uses a recording line that merges calls to record — a method that increases both costs and complexity, per Kabra. These challenges ultimately led to the feature being discontinued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has <a href=\"https://support.truecaller.com/support/solutions/articles/81000417994-how-do-i-save-my-call-recordings-to-my-iphone-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">set up a support page</a> to help users if they face any issues during the transition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truecaller’s move comes months after Apple introduced native call recording and transcription support for iPhone users in an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/how-to-enable-apple-intelligence-on-your-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iOS 18.1 update</a> last year. The native feature does not require users to connect to a record line to record the call, unlike Truecaller, and also brings Apple Intelligence-powered transcriptions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Truecaller had introduced call recording in the first place to entice iPhone users to upgrade, as the caller ID function is limited on the free tier. Paying users also get <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/truecaller-brings-real-time-caller-id-to-iphone-users/\">real-time caller ID</a>, along with advanced and automatic spam blocking, Siri shortcuts, incognito mode, and other features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truecaller has around 3 million subscribers worldwide, but iOS accounts for 44% of its total premium revenue, per its <a href=\"https://mb.cision.com/Public/20429/4208853/8901805dd05d8c0d.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">second-quarter financial results</a> (PDF). </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal is part of OpenAI’s broader strategy to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/openai-raises-40b-at-300b-post-money-valuation/\">secure $40 billion this year</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The oversubscribed round came months ahead of schedule, per the NYT. OpenAI initially raised $2.5 billion from VC firms in March when it announced its intention to raise $40 billion in a round spearheaded by SoftBank. The AI giant had planned to take on an additional $7.5 billion by the end of the year, but beat itself to the punch as investors clamber to get onto its cap table amid impressive growth.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-hits-12-billion-annualized-revenue-breaks-700-million-chatgpt-weekly-active-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Information</a> reported OpenAI hit $12 billion in annualized revenue and surpassed 700 million ChatGPT weekly active users. The Times today said that the number is closer to $13 billion, with projections to reach $20 billion by the end of the year. Other tailwinds include the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/\">Trump administration’s AI Action Plan</a> and<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/microsoft-in-talks-to-maintain-access-to-openais-tech-beyond-agi-milestone/\"> talks with Microsoft</a> that could help the startup reach its goal of becoming a true for-profit company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Times reported that Dragoneer Investment Group, an under-the-radar investor, led the round with a startling $2.8 billion check. Many new investors participated in the round, including private equity giants Blackstone and TPG, and mutual fund manager T. Rowe Price. Other participants include Altimeter Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue Management, D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity Management, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, and Thrive Capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some early investors in OpenAI were reportedly dismayed by the smaller allocations they got in the round as the AI behemoth prioritized bringing on new strategic backers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
