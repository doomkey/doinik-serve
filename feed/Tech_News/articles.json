NASA astronauts will be allowed to bring their smartphones to space for the first time, starting with the Crew-12 and Artemis II missions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crew-12 is expected to head to the International Space Station <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/commercialcrew/2026/01/28/nasas-spacex-crew-12-begins-quarantine-for-space-station-mission/\">next week</a>, while the highly anticipated Artemis II mission — which will <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://time.com/7346146/artemis-ii-launch-nasa-astronauts-moon-mission/\">bring humans around the moon</a> for the first time since the 1960s — was delayed until March.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/NASAAdmin/status/2019259382962307393\">wrote</a> on X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the newest iPhones and Android devices at hand, the crew will be able to be a bit more spontaneous with image and video gathering, meaning that for those of us back home, these upcoming trips to space could end up being some of NASA’s most well-documented journeys yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Imagine how cool (or cringe-worthy) it will be if astronauts turn themselves into TikTok stars in zero gravity, or if they take ultra-wide-angle selfies in the spacecraft. For those working in government bureaucracy, it’s equally exciting, apparently, that NASA approved this rule change pretty quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” Isaacman wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It makes sense that it would be hard to approve new technology to go into space — if one small thing is astray, a spaceflight can go terribly wrong. Until now, the newest cameras that were supposed to go on these missions were decade-old Nikon DSLRs and GoPros, according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-will-finally-allow-astronauts-to-bring-their-iphones-to-space/\">Ars Technica</a>.

It’s an open platform, which means users can manage agents built outside of OpenAI too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Frontier users can program AI agents to connect to external data and applications which allows them to execute tasks far outside of the OpenAI platform. Users can also limit and manage what these agents have access to, and what they can do, of course.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said Frontier was designed to work the same way companies manage human employees. Frontier offers an onboarding process for agents and a feedback loop that is meant to help them improve over time the same way a review might help an employee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI touted enterprises including HP, Oracle, State Farm and Uber as customers, but Frontier is currently only available to a limited number of users with plans to roll out more generally in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company would not disclose pricing details on a press briefing earlier this week, according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/874258/openai-frontier-ai-agent-platform-management\">reporting from The Verge</a>. OpenAI declined to comment on pricing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agent-management products  become table stakes since AI agents rose to prominence in 2024. Salesforce has arguably the best-known such product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/salesforce-ai-chatbot-agentforce-hits-general-availability/\">Agentforce</a>, which the company launched in the fall of 2024. Others have quickly followed. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/open-source-agentic-startup-langchain-hits-1-25b-valuation/\">LangChain</a> is a notable player in the space that was founded in 2022 and has raised more than $150 million in venture capital. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/crewai-uses-third-party-models-to-automate-business-tasks/\">CrewAI</a> is a smaller upstart that has raised more than $20 million in venture capital.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, global research and advisory firm Gartner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.parloa.com/guides-ebooks-and-reports/gartner-ai-agent-sprawl/\">released a report</a> about this type of software and called agent management platforms both the “most valuable real estate in AI” and a necessary piece of infrastructure for enterprises to adopt AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not surprising that OpenAI would release this platform in early 2026 as the company has made it clear that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/openai-is-coming-for-those-sweet-enterprise-dollars-in-2026/\">enterprise adoption is one of its main focus areas for this year</a>.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Anthropic released the latest version of Opus — its most advanced model and a particularly important model for Claude Code. Opus 4.5 was only released <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude/opus\">last November</a> and, with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams”— teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents—each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5) <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows\">currently offers</a>. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now, the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">White told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain—that is, software development—into a program that could be “really useful for a broader set” of knowledge workers. “We noticed a lot of people who are not professional software developers using Claude Code simply because it was a really amazing engine to do tasks,” he said. White added that the kinds of people the company has seen using it include not just software engineers, but product managers, financial analysts, and people from a variety of other industries.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Coming just months after its Series B, Clay’s offer of liquidity was a rarity in a market where tender offers, as these types of secondary transactions are known, were still uncommon for relatively young companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, several other newer, fast-growing startups have allowed their staff to convert some of their stock into cash. Linear, a six-year-old AI-powered Atlassian rival, completed <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://linear.app/now/giving-our-team-liquidity-through-linear-s-first-tender-offer\">a tender offer</a> at the same valuation as the company’s $1.25 billion Series C. More recently, the three-year-old ElevenLabs authorized a $100 million secondary sale for staff, at a valuation of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog/announcing-an-employee-tender\">$6.6 billion</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/elevenlabs-raises-180-million-in-series-c-funding-at-3-3-billion-valuation/\">double</a> its previous value.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And just last week, Clay, which has tripled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $100 million in one year, decided it was again time for its employees to cash in on the company’s fast growth. The eight-year-old startup announced that its staff can sell stock at a valuation of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/dealbook/clay-start-up-tender-offers.html\">$5 billion</a>, a more than 60% increase from its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/clay-confirms-it-closed-100m-round-at-3-1b-valuation/\">$3.1 billion</a> valuation announced in August.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These secondary sales at increasingly higher valuations for young, perhaps still-unproven companies may initially appear to be a premature “cash out” reminiscent of the 2021 bubble. The most infamous example of that time was Hopin, whose founder, Johnny Boufarhat, reportedly sold $195 million worth of his company’s stock just two years before the company’s assets were sold for a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/networking/ringcentral-to-pay-50m-for-startup-hopin-s-events-management-assets\">tiny fraction</a> of its peak <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/hopin-ringcentral/\">$7.7 billion</a> valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there is a critical distinction between the 2021 boom and today’s market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the ZIRP era, a large portion of the secondary deals provided liquidity almost exclusively to founders of buzzy companies like Hopin. In contrast, the recent transactions from Clay, Linear, and ElevenLabs are structured as tender offers that also benefit employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While investors these days largely frown upon the outsized founder payouts of the 2021 boom, the current shift toward employee-wide tender offers is viewed far more favorably.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve done a lot of tenders, and I haven’t seen any drawbacks yet,” Nick Bunick, a partner at the secondary-focused VC firm NewView Capital, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As companies stay private longer and talent competition intensifies, allowing employees to turn some of their paper gains into cash can be a powerful tool for recruiting, morale, and retention, he said. “A little liquidity is healthy, and we’ve certainly seen that across the ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of Clay’s first tender offer, co-founder Kareem Amin <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/clay-authorizes-employee-tender-at-a-1-5b-valuation-led-by-sequoia/\">told TechCrunch</a> that the main reason for giving employees a chance to cash some of otherwise illiquid stock was to ensure that “the gains don’t just accumulate to a few people.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some fast-growing AI startups are realizing that without offering early liquidity, they risk losing their best talent to public companies or more mature startups like OpenAI and SpaceX, which regularly offer tender sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s hard not to see the positive aspects of allowing startup employees to reap cash rewards from their hard work, Ken Sawyer, co-founder and managing partner at secondary firm Saint Capital, pointed to unintended second-order effects of employee tenders. “It is very positive for employees, of course,” he said. “But it enables companies to stay private longer, reducing liquidity for venture investors, which is a challenge for LPs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, relying on tenders as a long-term substitute for IPOs could create a vicious cycle for the venture ecosystem. If limited partners don’t see cash returns, they will be more reluctant to back the very VC firms that invest in startups.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Launched last September, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/meta-launches-vibes-a-short-form-video-feed-of-ai-slop/\">Vibes</a> lets you create and share short-form AI-generated videos and access a dedicated feed that displays AI videos from others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Think TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every single video you come across is AI-generated. Until now, the feed has lived in the Meta AI app. By making Vibes available outside of the Meta AI app, the company is positioning it as a more direct competitor to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/openais-sora-app-is-struggling-after-its-stellar-launch/\">Sora, OpenAI’s AI-generated video and social app</a> that launched shortly after Vibes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,” Meta said in an emailed statement. “We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@crumbler/post/DUURM5XiYLu/new-in-platformer-meta-is-testing-a-standalone-vibes-app-httpswwwplatformernewss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Platformer</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it doesn’t share specific numbers, but claims Vibes has performed well, with Meta AI usage continuing to grow steadily since its launch, which it believes signals demand for a standalone app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant also notes that while users engage with content in Meta AI, a standalone app allows for a more focused experience for creation and engagement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vibes lets users generate a video from scratch or remix a video that they see on their feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says collaboration and sharing are on the rise, with many Vibes videos being messaged to friends, which the company says mirrors how people use Reels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/meta-to-test-premium-subscriptions-on-instagram-facebook-and-whatsapp/\">Meta told TechCrunch</a> last week that, in addition to testing new premium subscriptions across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it’s going to explore subscriptions for AI features, including Vibes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Vibes has been free since its launch, Meta plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month. Meta plans to launch these test subscriptions in the coming months. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, is confident enough that it’s building a massive reactor that costs several hundred million dollars. But the device won’t be turned on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/commonwealth-fusion-systems-installs-reactor-magnet-lands-deal-with-nvidia/\">until next year</a>, leaving the question unanswered for now.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies that were founded more recently think they have a shot at building a fusion power plant for less, including <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pacificfusion.com\">Pacific Fusion</a>, which today announced the results of a series of experiments it performed at Sandia National Laboratory that it says will eliminate some costly parts of its approach. The company exclusively shared the results with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion power promises to generate large amounts of electricity 24/7 and deliver it in a way that’s familiar to today’s grid operators. Most fusion startups are targeting the early to mid-2030s to switch on their first commercial fusion power plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pacific Fusion is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/heres-how-pacific-fusion-plans-to-build-a-fusion-power-plant/\">chasing an approach</a> known as pulser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF). At its core, it’s similar to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">experiments</a> carried out at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The company compresses small fuel pellets in rapid succession, and that compression causes atoms inside the fuel to fuse and release energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But where NIF uses lasers to kick off the compression, Pacific Fusion wants to use massive pulses of electricity. Those pulses will create a magnetic field that encircles the fuel pellet — about the size of a pencil eraser — causing it to compress in less than 100 billionths of a second.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The faster you can implode it, the hotter it’ll get,” Keith LeChien, co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the challenges with pulser-driven ICF is that the process has typically needed a bit of a kickstart to work properly. To create conditions in the fuel pellet hot enough for fusion, researchers have been using both lasers and magnets to warm it up beforehand. “It’s just a little bit of energy just to give it a little bit of a boost before you compress it,” LeChien said, on the order of 5% to 10% of the total energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the added lasers and magnets add upfront complexity, cost, and maintenance requirements to the machine, making it that much harder to sell power at competitive prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So in the experiments at Sandia, Pacific Fusion tweaked the design of the cylinder encasing the fuel pellet and adjusted the electrical current delivered to it. Before the big pulse of electricity that ignites the fusion reaction, the company allowed a bit of the magnetic field to leak through to the fuel before compressing it, warming it in the process. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can make very subtle changes to how this cylinder is manufactured that allow the magnetic field to leak or to seep into the fuel before it’s compressed,” LeChien said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pacific Fusion’s fuel is loaded in a plastic target that’s wrapped in aluminum. By varying the thickness of the aluminum, the company can adjust how much of the magnetic field makes its way to the fuel. The casing needs to be manufactured with some precision, but nothing crazy, LeChien said — something on the order of what’s required for a .22 caliber bullet casing. “That’s a process that’s been honed and manufactured and perfected over 100 plus years,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tweaks don’t significantly change how much energy Pacific Fusion needs to deliver to the target. “It doesn’t take much energy to actually allow that magnetic field into the center of the fuel,” he said. “It’s a tiny fraction, much less than 1%. It’s a very, very, very small fraction of the overall energy in the system, so it’s effectively unnoticeable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eliminating the magnetic system would simplify the system and its maintenance requirements, which would have a modest effect on overall cost, he said. But getting rid of the laser would cut costs significantly. “The scale of laser [needed] to preheat these types of systems at high gain is north of $100 million.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeChien said experiments like this also help refine the company’s simulations to ensure they’re in agreement with what happens in the real world. “A lot of people have simulated things and said, ‘Oh, this will work or that will work,’” he said. “It’s a very different game to simulate something, build it, test it, and have it work. Closing that loop is hard.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s the headline; the subtext is more intriguing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stockpile initiative, branded as Project Vault, is the latest attempt by the administration to secure supplies of critical minerals for U.S. manufacturers and what President Donald Trump says will ensure “American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It follows recent investments from the administration into rare earth producers, including equity stakes in miners <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/usa-rare-earth-enters-pact-for-1-6-billion-of-federal-funds-22626027?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqeDeoStXNGzrT5S2o8Q5DS-WzddeezvmvKR4t4iGSfvIlJBcqsZEz7w&amp;gaa_ts=69823f54&amp;gaa_sig=JmZjyUCHLkSNVbGQ-wYz-q4uA3NBd_wWS5WOeEMFQKCBqbzlg9BvEpzFBIkE0YNhKnfVfCoO5oFBWSs4c0iG_A==\">USA Rare Earth</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html\">MP Materials</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Individually, they can be interpreted as an administration taking steps to calm a part of the market that has been roiled by its own trade wars. Collectively, they’re an admission, however tacit or subconscious, that the future relies on electric technologies, including electric vehicles and wind turbines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his announcement, Trump alluded to the world’s dependence on China for a slew of critical minerals. Over the last year-plus, China has wielded its dominance to counter tariff threats from the Trump administration, restricting exports of rare earth metals and lithium battery materials to the United States. Eventually, China relented, but the episode made clear who held the trump card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The spat also revealed just how integral critical minerals are to modern economies. Trump likened the new stockpile to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintained by the Department of Energy, which was set up in the wake of the oil embargo in the early 1970s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defense, we’re now creating this reserve for American industry, so we don’t have any problems,” Trump said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The oil reserve isn’t going away, but it’s not as important as it once was, diminished by productive U.S. oil wells and the increasing share of the energy market taken by solar, wind, and batteries. (Solar and wind <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2025/setting-the-scene#abstract\">continue to dominate</a> new electric generating capacity, while <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-ev-leapfrog-how-emerging-markets-are-driving-a-global-ev-boom/\">more than 25% of new cars</a> sold worldwide were EVs or plug-in hybrids.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear exactly which minerals will go into the reserve; Bloomberg reported that gallium and cobalt will be included. It’s possible that others like copper and nickel might get thrown in as well, though they weren’t mentioned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The size of the investment is notable. The U.S. Export-Import Bank is providing a $10 billion loan, with private capital rounding out the rest. That’s about half the value of the oil currently in the Strategic Oil Reserve going toward a market that’s 1% the size of the global oil market, as Bloomberg columnist David Fickling <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2026-02-03/a-12-billion-critical-minerals-reserve-promises-a-glut?embedded-checkout=true\">pointed out</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The mismatch is either typical Trump bluster or an acknowledgement that the market for critical minerals is going to expand significantly in the coming years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is possible it’s both, with a greater chance it is the latter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the growth in critical minerals comes from clean energy technologies and EVs; without them, the market won’t be as constrained as experts have predicted. Demand for electronics, including data centers, will play a role, but more than half of global growth in rare earth element demand is expected to come from electric vehicles and wind turbines, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/critical-minerals-data-explorer\">according</a> to the IEA. For cobalt and lithium, the figures are even more skewed, with EVs representing the vast majority of growth through 2050. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration hasn’t been quiet about its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/trump-doe-confirms-its-canceling-over-700m-in-manufacturing-grants/\">distain</a> for clean energy technologies, preferring to bet on the status quo with fossil fuels. But the rest of the world is continuing to move toward solar, wind, and batteries, driving up demand for critical minerals. The new stockpile shows that markets can be hard to ignore.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don’t work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Called a Large Tabular Model (LTM) rather than a Large Language Model (LLM), Fundamental’s Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn’t rely on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/\">the transformer architecture</a> that defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use-case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that’s within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. But that kind of enormous structured dataset is common within large enterprises, creating a significant opportunity for models that can handle the scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Fraenkel sees it, that’s a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to Big Data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can now have one model across all of your use cases, so you can now expand massively the number of use cases that you tackle,” he told TechCrunch. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That promise has already brought in a number of high-profile contracts, including seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 clients. The company has also entered into a strategic partnership with AWS that will allow AWS users to deploy Nexus directly from existing instances.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The result, he argued, is a shift in how people interact with technology. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the years ahead, he said, “hopefully all our phones will go back in our pockets, and we can immerse ourselves in the real world around us, with voice as the mechanism that controls technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That vision fueled ElevenLabs’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/elevenlabs-raises-500m-from-sequioia-at-a-11-billion-valuation/\">$500 million raise</a> this week at an $11 billion valuation, and it is increasingly shared across the AI industry. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/openai-bets-big-on-audio-as-silicon-valley-declares-war-on-screens/\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/googles-ai-mode-can-now-have-back-and-forth-voice-conversations/\">Google</a> have both made voice a central focus of their next-generation models, while Apple appears to be quietly building voice-adjacent, always-on technologies through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/apple-buys-israeli-startup-q-ai-as-the-ai-race-heats-up/\">acquisitions like Q.ai.</a> As AI spreads into wearables, cars, and other new hardware, control is becoming less about tapping screens and more about speaking, making voice a key battleground for the next phase of AI development. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iconiq Capital general partner Seth Pierrepont echoed that view onstage at Web Summit, arguing that while screens will continue to matter for gaming and entertainment, traditional input methods like keyboards are starting to feel “outdated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And as AI systems become more agentic, Pierrepont said, the interaction itself will also change, with models gaining guardrails, integrations, and context needed to respond with less explicit prompting from users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Staniszewski pointed to that agentic shift as one of the biggest changes underway. Rather than spelling out every instruction, he said future voice systems will increasingly rely on persistent memory and context built up over time, making interactions feel more natural and requiring less effort from users. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That evolution, he added, will influence how voice models are deployed. While high-quality audio models have largely lived in the cloud, Staniszewski said ElevenLabs is working toward a hybrid approach that blends cloud and on-device processing — a move aimed at supporting new hardware, including headphones and other wearables, where voice becomes a constant companion rather than a feature you decide when to engage with. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ElevenLabs is already partnering with Meta to bring its voice technology to products including Instagram and Horizon Worlds, the company’s virtual reality platform. Staniszewski said he would also be open to working with Meta on its Ray-Ban smart glasses as voice-driven interfaces expand into new form factors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as voice becomes more persistent and embedded in everyday hardware, it opens the door to serious concerns around privacy, surveillance, and how much personal data voice-based systems will store as they move closer to users’ daily lives — something <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/google-pays-68-million-to-settle-claims-its-voice-assistant-spied-on-users/\">companies like Google</a> have already been accused of abusing.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company also recognizes that many readers still value physical books, and by offering both print and digital formats, Spotify is trying to turn itself into a one-stop shop for book lovers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify has partnered with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bookshop.org\">Bookshop.org</a> on the new offering, an online marketplace that supports local, independent bookstores. This partnership is great news for indie booksellers, as every purchase made via Spotify will directly benefit local book communities. Spotify then earns an affiliate fee on sales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ability to purchase physical books will roll out this spring and appear on audiobook pages in the app as a button labeled “Add to your bookshelf at home.” Clicking it takes users to Bookshop’s website, which handles the pricing, inventory, and shipping.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089631\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=720,360 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=900,450 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=800,400 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=668,334 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=708,354 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To bridge the gap between formats, Spotify is also launching a feature called Page Match, which is currently available to premium subscribers and will roll out to all audiobook users by late February. The feature was initially spotted by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-page-match-3633793/\">Android Authority</a> last month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify’s new Page Match feature lets users scan a page from a physical or e-book using their phone camera. The tool analyzes the page content and directs users to the exact spot in the audiobook. It’s powered by a combination of Spotify’s in-house and third-party computer vision and image scanning technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When users want to switch to the audiobook, they can select the “Scan to Listen” button and click the “Scan to Read” button to return to the physical book, making it easy for users to pick up where they left off, whether they’re reading at home or switching to audio while on the go.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Page Match is currently available for most English-language titles, with plans for future expansion. There are now more than 500,000 titles on the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the two years since Spotify first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/spotify-brings-audiobooks-to-u-s-users-with-a-catalog-of-300000-titles-to-start/\">introduced audiobooks</a>, the platform has experienced significant growth.

The camera pans to a man earnestly asking a chatbot (obviously intended to depict ChatGPT) for advice on how to talk to his mom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bot, portrayed by a blonde woman, offers some classic bits of advice. Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won’t be coming to its own chatbot, Claude.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQRu7DdTTVA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Another commercial</a> features a slight young man looking for advice on building a six pack. After offering his height, age, and weight, the bot serves him an ad for height-boosting insoles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Anthropic commercials are cleverly aimed at OpenAI’s users, after that company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-users-are-about-to-get-hit-with-targeted-ads/\">recent announcement </a>that ads will be coming to ChatGPT’s free tier. And they caused an immediate stir, spawning headlines that Anthropic <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/anthropic-super-bowl-ad-mocks-chatgpt-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“mocks,”</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-super-bowl-openai-chatgpt-ads-claude-2026-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“skewers,”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/873685/anthropics-first-super-bowl-ad-dunks-on-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“dunks on”</a> OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They are funny enough that even Sam Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">admitted on X</a> that he laughed at them. But he clearly didn’t really find them funny. They inspired him to write a novella-sized rant that devolved into calling his rival “dishonest” and “authoritarian.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that post, Altman explains that an ad-supported tier is intended to shoulder the burden of offering free ChatGPT to many of its millions of users. ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/chatgpts-user-growth-has-slowed-report-finds/\">is still the most popular chatbot by a large margin</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the OpenAI CEO insisted the ads were “dishonest” in implying that ChatGPT will twist a conversation to insert an ad (and possibly for an off-color product, to boot).”We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote in the social media post. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, OpenAI has promised ads will be separate, labeled, and will never influence a chat. But the company has also said it is planning on making them conversation-specific — which is the central allegation of Anthropic’s ads. As OpenAI explained on <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its blog,</a> “We plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman then went on to fling some equally questionable assertions at his rival. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,” he wrote. “We also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Claude has a free chat tier, too, with subscriptions at $0, $17, $100, and $200. ChatGPT’s tiers are $0, $8, $20, and $200. One could argue the subscription tiers are fairly equivalent.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman also alleged in his post that “Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI.” He argues it blocks usage of Claude Code from “companies they don’t like,” like OpenAI, and said Anthropic tells people what they can and can’t use AI for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">True, Anthropic’s whole marketing deal since day one has been <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-achieves-iso-42001-certification-for-responsible-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“responsible AI.”</a> The company was founded by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/26/the-openai-mafia-15-of-the-most-notable-startups-founded-by-alumni/\">two former OpenAI alums, after all</a>, who claimed they grew alarmed about AI safety when they worked there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, both chatbot companies have <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">usage policies</a>, AI guardrails, and <a href=\"https://openai.com/safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">talk about AI safety.</a> And while OpenAI allows ChatGPT to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-will-soon-allow-erotica-for-adult-users/\">be used for erotica</a> while Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">does not</a>, OpenAI, like Anthropic, has determined that <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some content should be blocked</a>, particularly in regards to mental health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet Altman took this Anthropic-tells-you-what-to-do argument to an extreme level when he accused Anthropic of being “authoritarian.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using “authoritarian” in a rant over a cheeky Super Bowl ad is misplaced, at best. It’s particularly tactless when considering the current geopolitical environment in which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/02/03/iran-protests-deaths-crackdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">protesters around the world</a> have been killed by agents of their own government. While business rivals have been duking it out in ads since the beginning of time, clearly Anthropic hit a nerve.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How can I communicate better with my mom?\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBSam25u8O4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Q4, Snap’s revenue <a href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Snap-Inc-Q4-25-Earnings-Slides.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was $1.7 billion</a>, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month/\">launched back in 2022</a>. The service’s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter — dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/snap-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-below-estimates-ad-competition-hurts-2026-02-04/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reuters also reports</a> that the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts’ previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During Wednesday’s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company’s newer offerings, including its recent effort to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/nation-world/snapchat-charge-users-storing-memories/507-73964864-5cb6-4dfb-b380-123b66626619\">charge users for Memories</a> storage — a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps — and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019. In anticipation of that event, Snap recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/\">announced the creation</a> of a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., that is focused solely on further developing the glasses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our long-term vision for augmented reality extends beyond the smartphone to a future when computing is more natural, contextual and seamlessly integrated into the real world,” said Spiegel. The CEO added that it was important to develop a “strong standalone brand” for Specs, as he said the hardware product could appeal “to a different audience segment” than the “core Snapchat audience.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, it sounds like the strategy behind Specs may not be entirely ironed out yet. Later in the conversation, Spiegel continued: “We’re so close to launch that the key here is really just, you know, nailing the launch and making sure that we deliver an extraordinary product. And then, you know, I think we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we want to capitalize [on] it moving forward.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But according to Kembara co-founder and general partner Yann de Vries, getting to €750 million in two years as a first fund in this environment “was not easy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kembara is managed by a specialist team within Mundi Ventures, with offices in Madrid, London, Barcelona, and Paris. Mundi Ventures founder Javier Santiso is now also a co-founder and GP of the Kembara fund, which has now disclosed the full list of its senior partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside de Vries and Santiso, climate tech VC Robert Trezona and deep tech VC Pierre Festal have also joined as general partners, as well as former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as senior strategic advisor. <em>(Pictured from left to right: Javier Santiso, Siraj Khaliq, Robert Trezona, Yann de Vries and Pierre Festal.)</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their individual track records helped them raise funds from institutional backers waking up to the need for European growth capital that can turn its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/76-european-deep-tech-university-spinouts-reached-unicorn-or-centaur-status/\">many university spinouts</a> into sizable businesses with industrial synergies. But it also gave them a front-row seat into the broader growing pains of European climate and deep tech startups — especially de Vries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A seasoned venture capitalist who founded Redpoint eVentures Brazil and later became a partner at Atomico, de Vries had moved to the other side of the table to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/atomico-partner-joins-lilium/\">join German electric aircraft startup Lilium</a> — only for the company to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/electric-aircraft-startup-lilium-ceases-operations-1000-workers-laid-off/\">cease operations</a> in 2024 after raising more than $1 billion and going public via a SPAC. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In de Vries’ view, Lilium went bankrupt because it couldn’t find the growth capital it needed, but this “traumatizing experience” also had a silver lining. “I saw so many amazing teams in Europe that were going through the same journey,” he said. “[Europe] doesn’t have an innovation problem. It doesn’t have a startup problem. The problem it has is a scale-up problem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kembara’s sweet spot will be Series B and C rounds, with plans to write initial checks from €15 million to €40 million into some 20 companies. But the fund’s size leaves room for follow-ons to help portfolio startups scale manufacturing and expand globally, and total investments could go up to €100 million per company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s more than the full size of many European funds, though this may be changing: deep tech VC firm Elaia and asset manager Lazard teamed up to form <a href=\"https://lazardelaiacapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LEC</a> (Lazard Elaia Capital), whose initial investments will range between €20 million and €60 million per company, while operator-led fund <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/22/plural-the-vc-led-by-founders-pulls-together-a-new-432m-fund-to-back-european-startups/\">Plural</a> is reportedly <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/plural-new-fund-1bn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raising a new fund of up to €1 billion</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the capital-intensive nature of most climate and deep tech growth-stage companies means that even large VC checks can only go so far. One lesson de Vries learned from Lilium is that raising only in equity is very hard, and even puts companies in a hard spot later on. This inspired Kembara to take a different approach to financing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Several of us have lived through this, and what we want to do now is to productize non-dilutive financing for these deep tech founders to help them de-risk their future financing and optimize the capital structure to minimize dilution. And we’re bringing in [limited partners] who […] not only want to invest in the fund, but also want to coinvest in those winners,” de Vries said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For these LPs, geopolitics also plays a role in wanting to provide growth capital and venture debt to European growth-stage startups. “There’s going to be a lot of support from sovereign wealth funds in Europe, from government, from corporations, to push and drive for building these European champions in deep tech out of Europe,” de Vries predicted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These geopolitical undertones are also reflected in Kembara’s sector focus, which includes dual use and defense tech to “protect European sovereignty,” according to a press release. However, de Vries pushed back against the idea that Kembara is simply replacing capital that later-stage European outfits could have raised abroad. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are lots of gems that are under the radar in Europe, that could be scaling into global champions, and that are not realizing their full potential.” He said DeepMind is a related example, “where they were missing this growth capital and sold too early.” (Google acquired the company for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/26/google-deepmind/\">more than $500 million in 2014</a>, but it is now estimated to be worth billions.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Keeping European companies European has gained urgency in many verticals that overlap with Kembara’s thesis, such as quantum computing, semiconductors, and space tech. But its goal is to foster global champions that cross borders. Coincidentally, Kembara means “to wander” in Malaysian (although the team holds “the humble path to excellence” as an older meaning).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the name, Kembara has Malaysian connections. Santiso is also the former CEO for Europe of Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah; and doors could open as many countries examine their exposure to the U.S. “In the second close, we’re going to be looking for global investors, because we want to have global access to markets, but also global access to supply chain,” de Vries said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With former employees who went on to create dozens of startups, the fintech company has become one of the most prolific “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/why-europe-and-israels-unicorns-are-producing-the-next-generation-of-tech-founders/\">founder factories</a>” — and the money is following. The latest example: business identity verification startup Duna, which just raised a €30 million Series A to become the best-funded European member of the so-called “Stripe mafia.” The funding round was led by Alphabet’s growth fund <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/a-peek-at-how-things-work-today-inside-alphabets-7-billion-growth-stage-investing-arm-capitalg/\">CapitalG</a>, which has also backed Stripe since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/25/payments-provider-stripe-has-raised-another-150-at-a-9b-valuation/\">co-leading its Series D</a> in 2016.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based in Germany and the Netherlands, Duna was co-founded by Stripe alumni Duco van Lanschot and David Schreiber. With customers including <a href=\"https://duna.com/news/duna-conversations-plaid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Plaid</a>, the startup helps fintech companies onboard business customers more efficiently, reducing the typical churn associated with corporate ID checks and other fraud prevention measures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stripe is not a customer of Duna, van Lanschot said, but its executives were well placed to understand the opportunity that the startup is seizing, which is reflected in its cap table. The company’s angel investors include former Stripe executives David Singleton (CTO), Claire Hughes Johnson (COO) and Michael Cocoman (Global Chief Compliance Officer). Even Stripe rival Adyen got involved, with CRCO Mariëtte Swart and CFO Ethan Tandowsky joining as angels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their endorsements also validate van Lanschot’s hunch that these companies won’t compete with Duna, even though they could. “It requires such fine-grained controls that change on a company-by-company basis, that an Adyen or a Stripe isn’t going to spin out their business onboarding as a separate product where another enterprise customer can change all of the configurations,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If it’s still worth the effort for Duna, it’s because the startup is going after the long tail of enterprise clients that don’t have huge resources to dedicate to business onboarding. But it’s also because its vision doesn’t stop there: Duna’s ambition is to build a network that allows companies to reuse their verified identity information across multiple platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we want to build over time is a global trust infrastructure where we provide a digital passport for every business. So you can reuse your file from onboarding on [German spend management platform] Moss to onboard with Plaid, or you can reuse it to open up a bank account,” van Lanschot said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This goal resonated with Alex Nichols, the general partner who led CapitalG’s investment into the Series A. “I would say the common thing I look for in my investments are some sort of network effects, or more formal scale advantage,” he told TechCrunch. “I also love it when founders have an earned insight about a problem they may not know about otherwise, and this is a very good example of that,” he added.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Duna has competitors in the category known as KYB, or Know Your Business. This includes vendors such as Jumio and Veriff. But for Nichols, what sets Duna apart is its decision to generate its own data, rather than trying to aggregate existing data sources that are often lacking. “It’s the rare opportunity to rebuild something as foundational as a Visa and create an amazing business in the process.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Duna says it has already found a strong business case in helping customers onboard corporate users faster and cheaper. This also explains why existing investors are doubling down: Index Ventures, which led <a href=\"https://duna.com/news/duna-announces-10m-seed-round-led-by-index-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Duna’s €10.7 million seed round</a> in May 2025, participated in the Series A, as did Puzzle Ventures and Snowflake chairman Frank Slootman. But the startup’s bigger ambition won’t pay off until Duna reaches significant scale. So the company is looking for shortcuts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How so? Van Lanschot and the Duna team are identifying small clusters of companies that already overlap with each other — what they call “patches of networks.” These include manufacturing companies with shared customers, investment firms with overlapping LPs, or companies in the same small country. In these tight-knit groups, the ability to reuse verification becomes valuable immediately, even before Duna achieves full network effects.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The countries may be small, but the opportunity is big, van Lanschot said. “In the Netherlands alone — a tiny, tiny country — the four biggest banks employ 14,000 people in compliance, and half of them are working on businesses.” CapitalG later clarified that 13,000 people work on compliance across all Dutch banks. Either way, Duna won’t fully replace these jobs yet, but AI automation can save costs and generate revenue even before the network effects kick in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Duna eventually provides the rails for an identity network, there might be an even bigger opportunity in taking advantage of this position to enable one-click business onboarding. This would make it akin to Amazon’s one-click checkout — or closer to B2B, to Stripe Link. Once again with Duna, the Stripe connection is never really far.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated to correct the name and title of one of Duna’s angel investors, and to add a clarification on the number of people employed in compliance in the Netherlands.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Instead of responding to an analyst’s question about how the tech giant is thinking about AI partnerships, such as the one with Apple to power AI for Siri, the question was completely ignored.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That decision tells us something, though — Alphabet isn’t ready to talk about how this partnership will impact its core business, which is increasingly focused on AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, the Google-Apple relationship has been mutually beneficial. The two companies’ search partnership saw the search giant paying the iPhone maker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/\">$20 billion</a> to be the default search engine on Apple devices, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/\">filings</a> from the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against the search giant revealed. In turn, Google gained access to Apple’s massive customer base — the iPhone maker last quarter <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/29/apple-reveals-it-has-2-5-billion-active-devices-around-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> it has 2.5 billion active devices worldwide, to give you an idea of scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest Apple AI deal is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rumored to cost Apple roughly $1 billion per year</a>, but the payoff beyond that for Google isn’t as immediately obvious as it is with search. In Google Search, consumers see links to advertisers’ websites at the top of their search results. Ads in AI Mode, which could one day represent the future of Google’s search business, are still an “experiment” for now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/google-is-bringing-ads-to-ai-mode/\">announced</a> last May that it would bring ads to AI Mode, the chatbot-style interface for Google Search, but these tests see the ads’ placement below or integrated into the chatbot’s responses. Google is also trying out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/googles-ai-mode-gets-new-agentic-capabilities-to-help-book-event-tickets-and-beauty-appointments/\">agentic shopping</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-adds-ai-powered-shopping-features-for-discovery-and-easy-check-out/\">including Shop with AI Mode</a>, to guide consumers with product-related queries to a seamless checkout experience from the AI interface. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Google’s AI competitor Anthropic is taking aim at ad-supported AI with <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/anthropic-takes-aim-at-openais-chatgpt-in-super-bowl-ad-debut-e38d08bb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqc1PZNSJ8lc9dFddGDlVq0wcT5a0pBuydlkIbATMyrp6B9WP1OqhTKVcPie8tA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6983d32f&amp;gaa_sig=O2OoiPHPl5bz2EhQJdnea8J0YCB0cOi4ep7q9Bwk80flMOHbrFXkd8UBBkjD2zc8LZ11Fv1Dz6k-5Y2YAgZ-WA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its forthcoming Super Bowl ad,</a> which challenges the business model being adopted by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How this will all play out longer-term is still an open question — and for today, an unanswered one, apparently. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, the Apple Siri deal barely received any mention during Alphabet’s earnings call on Wednesday. Sundar Pichai only noted he was pleased that Apple’s “preferred cloud provider” and would be helping to develop “the next generation of Apple foundation models based on Gemini technology.” Google’s Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler used the exact same wording when mentioning Apple, as well.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-ai-has-nearly-500-million-users/\">reported </a>nearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/chatgpts-user-growth-has-slowed-report-finds/\">810 million MAUs</a> in late 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company’s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a “positive driver” for the company’s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google recently rolled out a more affordable plan, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/googles-ai-plus-plan-rolls-out-to-all-markets-including-the-u-s/\">the Google AI Plus</a>, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the call to investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini’s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet’s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand. Recently, Google introduced the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip, called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/google-unveils-ironwood-a-new-ai-accelerator-chip/\">Ironwood</a>, to compete with Nvidia.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we have great momentum. Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users. Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,” Pichai stated in today’s release.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This week, the platform announced a new tool designed to expand on that mission by helping the world’s WordPress users keep their articles in peak digital health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Archive’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/google-and-the-internet-archive-are-the-first-customers-to-pay-for-commercial-access-to-wikipedia-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wayback Machine</a>, which indexes the web through widespread snapshotting, has partnered with Automattic, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/wordpress-maker-automattic-lays-off-16-of-staff/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">company behind WordPress</a>. Together, the two organizations have launched a new WordPress plug-in — the Link Fixer — that is designed to combat the scourge of “link rot.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Link rot” is the unfortunate phenomenon whereby online articles become populated by broken links — URLs that once led to active pages but now result in error messages or dead ends. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pew Research study</a> from 2024 showed that nearly 40% of links that existed in 2013 were no longer active. Such “digital decay” occurs across a broad diversity of web pages, from news and government sites to Wikipedia pages to tweets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Automattic <a href=\"https://automattic.com/2026/02/04/wayback-machine-wordpress-link-fixer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">says that</a> its new plug-in works by scanning your WordPress posts for outbound links, then cross-referencing the Wayback Machine for archived versions of those links. If there are none, it will automatically take new snapshots of the articles in question. Should a linked web page go offline, the new feature will then redirect readers to the archived versions, so that there is no drop in service. The tool also archives a user’s own posts, helping to ensure their longevity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool is designed to keep a site’s visitors reading the best available version of a web page. Indeed, Automattic’s plug-in perpetually checks a web page’s links, and if an original link that had gone offline is resurrected, the plug-in will start redirecting the user to that original page again instead of the archived version.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://github.com/a8cteam51/internet-archive-wayback-machine-link-fixer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">write-up on Github</a> shows that the plug-in’s controls are relatively easy to maneuver and offer convenient customization. For instance, users can specify how often they want the plug-in to scan a link for validity (the default offered by the program is every three days).</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
