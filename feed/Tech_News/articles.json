Nor were they aware of the ‘Voter Data Agreement’,” Shapiro wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear if the two DOGE members ended up sharing the data, according to Shapiro, but emails “suggest that DOGE Team members could have been asked to assist the advocacy group by accessing SSA data to match to the voter rolls.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Shapiro, the SSA referred the two DOGE employees for potential violations of the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits federal workers from leveraging their official positions for political activities. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/federal-judge-blocks-doges-access-to-social-security-administrations-banks-of-personal-information/\">a federal judge issued an order</a> to block DOGE’s members access to SSA’s systems, which included SSNs, medical records, drivers’ license numbers, tax information, and other types of personal information. Later on, an SSA whistleblower alleged that DOGE <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/doge-uploaded-live-copy-of-social-security-database-to-vulnerable-cloud-server-says-whistleblower/\">uploaded hundreds of millions of Social Security records</a> to a vulnerable cloud server.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The organization would not say whether it plans to inform users about the security incident. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, a person who asked not to be named alerted TechCrunch to the security flaw on UStrive’s mentoring platform. By examining the network traffic while signed in and navigating the site — such as viewing user profiles — anyone could see streams of users’ personal information in their browser tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The person said that UStrive was relying on a vulnerable Amazon-hosted GraphQL endpoint — a type of query database interface — that allowed access to reams of user data stored on UStrive’s servers. Some user records contained more data than others, including information provided by the student, such as their gender and date of birth. The person said that there were at least 238,000 user records at the time of discovery. UStrive meanwhile states on its <a href=\"https://ustrive.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">home page</a> that more than “1.1 million students have opted in for a UStrive mentor.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch confirmed the data exposure after creating a new user account on UStrive, and notified the company’s executives by email on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">John D. McIntyre, an attorney with Virginia law firm McIntyre Stein, which is representing UStrive, said in a letter provided to TechCrunch later on Thursday that UStrive is “currently in litigation with one of its former software engineers,” and as such the company is “somewhat limited in its ability to respond.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch told McIntyre that the company at that time still had a security lapse exposing the private and personal information of children, and asked McIntyre to notify TechCrunch if UStrive planned to fix the data exposure, and if so, by when.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McIntyre did not respond to our inquiry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to TechCrunch’s initial outreach, UStrive chief technology officer Dwamian Mcleish told TechCrunch by email late on Thursday that the exposure had been “remediated.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch sent Mcleish follow-up emails with more questions about the incident, including: whether the company plans to notify its users about the security lapse, whether the company has the ability to check if there was any improper or malicious access to users’ data, and whether the company’s platform had undergone a security audit and, if so, by whom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UStrive founder Michael J. Carter did not comment for this article. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company, located in San Jose, makes Ethernet-based processors that help collect data from sensors scattered around a system — like in an autonomous vehicle — and quickly move it to a central computer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company was already backed by Porsche SE and Qualcomm Ventures, but this round was led by Maverick Silicon — an <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-14/early-nvidia-backer-maverick-is-launching-an-ai-focused-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI-focused</a> fund created in 2024 by hedge fund Maverick Capital.

Brands sell their excess inventory at discount retailers like Nordstrom Rack, but often lose money because managing unsold inventory is difficult. Products are spread across warehouses, and teams are left guessing the value of an item and when the best time to sell it is. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Too much time passes between each step of the off-channel inventory funnel, making it difficult to move products to the destinations that are most favorable for the brands and retailers,” Marshall told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She decided to give the off-channel market a tech boost. In 2024, she launched her company Another, a software system that helps companies manage unsold or excess products. The secondary markets where these items are usually sold operate under tight timelines and can feature highly dynamic pricing due to fluctuating demand. For a retailer to succeed in a place like Nordstrom Rack, it needs to have fast access to real-time data and coordination so that clothes can efficiently move from the retailer to the warehouse to the store, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another connects to a business’s existing software systems, such as those that manage customer returns, to better centralize an organization’s data and workflows. This way, teams across the company can access data from the same place, making decision-making more effective. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced Tuesday a $2.5 million seed round led by Anthemis FIL and Westbound. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marshall said she met her lead investors through an industry event last year and said the fresh capital will be used to speed product development and hire. She considers her competitors’ marketplaces like Ghost, another company that also helps brands sell unsold inventory.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, she said, Another hopes to help companies address excess inventory before brands opt to sell items to bulk resellers. She says items sold through such resellers may be deeply discounted, an outcome brands might not want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Another’s technology provides real-time data and insights that give teams confidence in when, where, and how to move inventory, enabling smarter decisions that maximize value rather than defaulting to liquidation,” she said. Overall, she hopes her product helps move the industry toward solutions that better balance profitability and sustainability, as excess inventory is often destroyed if it is not moved quickly enough. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Consumers gain access to better prices, more optionality, while brands and retailers improve profitability and reduce waste, making it a win for everyone involved.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The store, <a href=\"https://setapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Setapp Mobile</a>, from the Ukrainian-based developer MacPaw, first launched in September 2024, offering dozens of apps across categories like productivity, finance, video, photo, creativity, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its model offered consumers access to all of Setapp’s mobile apps through a $9.99 monthly subscription, provided the user’s Apple ID was associated with an EU member state.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the company says all applications will be removed from Setapp Mobile by the end of the sunset date, February 16, 2026. Applications that are available on Setapp Desktop will not be affected, the company told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news of the shutdown, announced on <a href=\"https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/13690464925212-About-Setapp-Mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Setapp’s support site</a>, was first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/setapp-mobile-eu-app-store-closing-next-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MacRumors</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MacPaw stated that “still-evolving and complex business terms that don’t fit Setapp’s current business model” are the reason for its decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “complex business terms” being referenced here are Apple’s complicated set of fees for apps operating under its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/apple-revises-its-dma-rules-after-pressure-but-keeps-the-core-technology-fee-intact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new business terms in the EU,</a> which include a controversial <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Core Technology Fee</a> that charges developers €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant revised its fee structure last year to avoid further penalties for noncompliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), but instead of simplifying the fees, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/apple-updates-the-rules-for-its-eu-app-store-by-adding-more-complicated-fees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it made them more complex</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One result of these constant changes is that developers can’t properly plan how to grow and monetize their business. It also suggests the fees, as they stand, don’t make running an alternative app store in the EU a viable option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Setapp said it found its business model was not “viable,” as the commercial conditions continued to change. The statement reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Setapp Mobile was a bold, breakthrough project that aimed to provide EU iOS users with access to alternative app marketplaces — creating a new app ecosystem where both developers and users could thrive. We are proud of what we have accomplished with it over the past two years and still believe passionately in this vision. As a result of still-evolving commercial conditions, we have determined that it is not viable to continue development or support for Setapp Mobile within Setapp’s current business model. While we are disappointed to discontinue Setapp Mobile and let down our user base and developer community in the EU, we are looking forward to pursuing the development of other innovations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/move-over-apple-meet-the-alternative-app-stores-coming-to-the-eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">still other alternative app stores operating in the EU</a>, including, most notably, the <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Epic Games Store</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/16/fortnite-maker-epic-games-launches-its-app-store-on-ios-in-the-eu-worldwide-on-android/\">from the maker of Fortnite</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/altstoreio/AltStore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open source AltStore</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Parthasarathy has had a storied history in the restaurant reservation industry. Prior to ReserveGo, he built a similar platform called inResto in 2014, which was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yourstory.com/2015/09/dineout-acquires-inresto\">acquired by </a><a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2015/09/dineout-acquires-inresto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Times Internet</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yourstory.com/2015/09/dineout-acquires-inresto\">-owned Dineout in 2015</a>. In 2022, Swiggy acquired <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/indian-food-delivery-giant-swiggy-is-acquiring-dineout/\">Dineout from Times Internet</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eat App acquired ReverseGo in mid-2025, which was serving over 1,000 restaurants at that time. Parthasarathy told TechCrunch that the platform has averaged handling 5 million reservations per month for the last 12 months without having any downtimes. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eat App also partnered with Swiggy to market its product to restaurants for upselling, which has taken the total restaurant tally for the startup over 2,000, with over 8 million covers served until the year’s end through various platforms. For comparison, Swiggy’s Dineout platform alone catered to over <a href=\"https://www.swiggy.com/corporate/press-release/how-india-swiggyd-2025-a-feast-for-the-fast-the-foodie-and-the-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">23.8 million covers in 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There has never been a more exciting time for the restaurant industry in the country, with steady consumer uptake and innovations. We believe access to Eat App’s world-class technology and AI-driven tools is going to improve restaurant management, helping restaurants across the country bring a more delightful experience to their guests,” Arpit Mathur, Vice President of Strategy at Swiggy, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, which was listed on the Indian markets last year, said that it partnered with Eat App to bring a global solution for restaurants to grow its business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swiggy and Eat App market this solution as GroMax for India, which includes add-ons such as the ability to promote restaurants on Meta and Swiggy, apart from reservation management. While Swiggy doesn’t play a part in product development, its sales team provides input to Eat App about potential features it can develop for the market.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083694\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg 3420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=1200,653 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=1280,696 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=430,234 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=720,392 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=900,489 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=800,435 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=1536,835 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=2048,1114 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=668,363 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=1134,617 1134w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=708,385 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Eat App</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before its India expansion, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was its biggest market, followed by the U.S., the U.K., and Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Honestly, like we see India, there’s very strong synergy and similarities between what we’ve seen in the [GCC] region eight, nine years ago, especially in Dubai, where we first, I would say, we were responsible for building that scaffolding, that tech infrastructure layer [for serving restaurants]. And we see a lot of similarities in India [to that],” Nezar Kadhem, CEO of Eat App, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We hope that whatever efforts were made in the region in Dubai and where restaurants have the tooling today, we could serve the same in India alongside local founders like Vijayan and the team to help us spearhead the change in India,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is a market with a big opportunity in the restaurant space. However, for restaurants, the challenge is to attract customers using every channel possible and then collate those reservations in one place. Parthasarathy noted that the top 200 restaurants in India are only available for customers through reservations. But for the next few thousand restaurants, it is a lot about capacity management through different channels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eat App’s growth faces a few obstacles. First, there are international competitors such as SevenRooms, TableCheck, and OpenTable, along with local ones like Petpooja and Posist. Second, some restaurants just bank on walk-ins or do not use an aggregation software to get data about their diners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several industry executives TechCrunch spoke with said that reservation aggregation software as a stand-alone product wouldn’t entice restaurant owners. Eat App will need to prove its growth suite brings enough value to restaurants.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

OSHA issued the maximum financial penalty it can levy on six of those “serious” violations, giving Elon Musk’s spaceflight company a combined fine of $115,850.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OSHA’s probe is still open according to the agency’s website. It’s still unclear whether any workers were harmed in the accident. SpaceX is able to contest the penalties; the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The penalty and violations come as SpaceX is set to ramp up activity at the Starbase facility, partly fueled by a race to fulfill President Donald Trump’s goal of returning astronauts to the moon by the end of his second term. The company has clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration to perform as many as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/science/spacex-gets-faa-approval-ramp-up-starship-launches-texas-2025-05-06/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">25 Starship launches in Texas this year</a>. At the same time, it is undergoing rapid expansion of the launch complex to meet Musk’s grand ambitions of building <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2007845976204296665\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">thousands of Starship rockets per year</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has had a long history of injuries at the South Texas launch complex. A 2023 Reuters report uncovered <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/spacex-musk-safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dozens of previously unreported injuries</a> — and one employee death — that happened as the facility was built up across the last decade. A TechCrunch analysis of OSHA data last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/spacex-worker-injury-rates-at-starbase-outpace-industry-rivals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">showed</a> SpaceX has a much higher injury rate at the Starbase site than at other facilities run by the company, or those of its industry peers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Accidents keep happening, too. In December, an employee of a SpaceX subcontractor filed a lawsuit against SpaceX after he was allegedly crushed by a large metal support dropped from a crane. OSHA is also investigating that accident, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/osha-investigating-new-crane-accident-at-spacexs-starbase-facility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch first reported</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/spacexs-starbase-city-officials-silent-on-crane-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">crane collapse</a> at the center of the new OSHA penalty happened on June 24, 2025. SpaceX employees at a Starbase test site were cleaning up debris from a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/19/spacexs-starship-blows-up-ahead-of-10th-test-flight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Starship explosion just four days prior</a>.

Discovery (WBD) shareholders, Netflix is now offering cash for shares of the company, revising the cash-and-stock deal it had struck with WBD’s board earlier. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the streaming giant is still offering the same $27.75 the companies had agreed on for WBD’s movie studio and streaming assets, and the deal continues to value the company at $82.7 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new offer serves to simplify the deal structure, the companies <a href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-and-Warner-Bros--Discovery-Amend-Agreement-to-All-Cash-Transaction/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> in a statement on Tuesday, and “provides greater certainty of value,” and speeds up the timeline for a shareholder vote. Netflix said it would finance the deal with cash, debt, and “committed financing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change-up comes as rival suitor Paramount Skydance has intensified efforts to win over WBD’s shareholders with its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">all-cash, $30-per-share offer</a> for the entirety of the company, including securing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/paramount-renews-bid-for-warner-bros-ensuring-40-billion-larry-ellison-backing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a $40 billion guarantee</a> from its CEO David Ellison’s billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paramount, which has been trying to buy Warner Bros.

The company also sought to expedite the lawsuit, but the court rejected that effort.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix, for its part, had until now stuck to its original cash-and-share offer, enjoying the full backing of WBD’s board, which has resolutely rejected Paramount’s bids. WBD has argued that selling to Netflix would make for a better deal because the streaming giant has the capital to pay, and has said that Paramount’s deal poses “materially more risk,” as it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">saddle the combined company with $87 billion in debt</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Warner Bros. has also called into question Paramount’s ability to function after the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount’s current “junk” credit rating, and has raised concerns about Paramount’s negative free cash flow, which would be exacerbated by the acquisition.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WBD said in October that it was exploring a sale after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties.

Permanent bans are a drastic action, locking people out of their profiles, memories, friend connections, and, in the case of creators and businesses, their ability to market and communicate with fans and customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the first time in the organization’s five-year history as an oversight body that permanent account bans have been a subject of the Oversight Board’s focus, the organization notes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case being reviewed isn’t exactly one of an everyday user. Instead, the case involves a high-profile Instagram user who repeatedly violated Meta’s <a href=\"https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Community Standards</a> by posting visual threats of violence against a female journalist, anti-gay slurs against politicians, content depicting a sex act, allegations of misconduct against minorities, and more. The account had not accumulated enough strikes to be automatically disabled, but Meta made the decision to permanently ban the account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Board’s materials didn’t name the account in question, but its recommendations could impact others who post content that targets public figures with abuse, harassment, and threats, as well as users who have their accounts permanently banned without receiving transparent explanations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta referred this specific case to the Board, which included five posts made in the year before the account was permanently disabled. The Board says it’s looking for input about several key issues: how permanent bans can be processed fairly, the effectiveness of its current tools to protect public figures and journalists from repeated abuse and threats of violence, the challenges of identifying off-platform content, whether punitive measures effectively shape online behaviors, and best practices for transparent reporting on account enforcement decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to review the particulars of the case comes after a year in which users have complained of mass bans with little information about what they did wrong. The issue has impacted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/facebook-group-admins-complain-of-mass-bans-meta-says-its-fixing-the-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook Groups</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/instagram-users-complain-of-mass-bans-pointing-finger-at-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">individual account holders</a> who believe that automated moderation tools are to blame. In addition, those who have been banned have complained that Meta’s paid support offering, Meta Verified, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/meta-users-say-paying-for-verified-support-has-been-useless-in-the-face-of-mass-bans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has proven useless to aid them</a> in these situations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether the Oversight Board has any real sway to address issues on Meta’s platform continues to be debated, of course. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Board has a limited scope to enact change at the social networking giant, meaning it can’t force Meta to make broader policy changes or address systemic issues. Notably, the Board isn’t consulted when CEO Mark Zuckerberg decides to make sweeping changes to the company’s policies — like its decision last year <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/01/13/meta-oversight-board-mark-zuckerberg-fact-checking-trump-michael-mcconnell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to relax hate speech restrictions</a>. The Board can make recommendations and can overturn specific content moderation decisions, but it can often be slow to render a decision. It also takes on relatively few cases compared to the millions of moderation decisions that Meta makes across its user base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/hcaCCyp4m4hA73gwUZf7Hxt1Op?domain=oversightboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a report released in December,</a> Meta has implemented 75% of more than 300 recommendations the Board has issued, and its content moderation decisions have been consistently followed by Meta. Meta also recently asked <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/4MrzCzq8n8HOGz3ZHXhpH9QDTL?domain=oversightboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">for the policy advisers’ opinion</a> on its implementation of the crowdsourced fact-checking feature Community Notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the Oversight Board issues its policy recommendations to Meta, the company has 60 days to respond. The Board is also soliciting public comments on this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: The public comments can be submitted anonymously; this post was updated after publication to reflect this.  </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Wingify co-founder Sparsh Gupta will lead the merged entity as CEO, while Everstone will remain the largest institutional shareholder.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal comes as digital experience tools, including those for A/B testing and personalization, are increasingly consolidating, as enterprises look to deploy AI across marketing, product, and growth teams without stitching together multiple vendors. The merged company will invest more heavily in AI-led capabilities over time, while keeping customer experience unchanged in the near term and expanding the depth of its platform gradually, Gupta said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Everstone is injecting significant additional capital as part of the transaction, Gupta told TechCrunch, describing it as primarily aimed at “cleaning up” ABTasty’s cap table and enabling the two businesses to come together under one platform. Financial terms were not disclosed, though Gupta indicated the deal includes a cash component alongside some equity rollover for existing leadership, allowing them to maintain ownership stakes in the new entity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupta framed the tie-up as a natural convergence between two long-time rivals. “Both the businesses have been operating as friendly competition,” he said, adding that the merger reflects growing demand from enterprises for more integrated, holistic digital experience platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The combined entity will be led by an executive team drawn from both organizations. Alongside Gupta as CEO, Wingify co-founder Ankit Jain will serve as chief product and technology officer, while ABTasty’s co-founders will take on senior roles: Rémi Aubert will become chief customer and strategy officer and Alix de Sagazan will serve as chief revenue officer, the companies said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg\" alt=\"Wingify and AB Tasty teams: Rémi Aubert, Sandeep Singh, Alix de Sagazan, Sprash Gupta, Ankit Jain\" class=\"wp-image-3083715\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wingify-ab-tasty-team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">(Left to Right) Rémi Aubert, Sandeep Singh, Alix de Sagazan, Sparsh Gupta, and Ankit Jain. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Wingify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both Wingify and ABTasty are profitable, Gupta said, and the merger is focused on building out the combined platform rather than cost-cutting. “There’s no layoffs that are planned as part of this merger,” he added, describing the rationale as “value creation at this point in time.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The combined company will have close to 800 employees across 11 offices globally, with roughly 350 staff based outside India, Gupta said, adding that the merged entity will be headquartered in New Delhi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-founded in 2010 by Paras Chopra and Gupta, Wingify <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/wingify-launches-a-new-ab-testing-platform-for-people-without-coding-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">remained bootstrapped for more than a decade</a>, with VWO becoming its flagship product, helping businesses improve online conversion rates through A/B testing and customer experience optimization. Everstone acquired a majority stake in the startup in January 2025, which also marked a significant exit for Chopra, as TechCrunch reported earlier. That deal set the stage for Everstone’s platform-building strategy that has now led to the ABTasty combination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wingify counts more than 3,000 brands as customers, including Forbes, Walt Disney, Amway, Hilton Vacations, TAP Portugal, and Cigna, across sectors such as e-commerce, SaaS, travel, and media.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Paris, ABTasty <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/ab-tasty-raises-40-million-to-optimize-e-commerce-user-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">provides experimentation and personalization software</a> used by more than 1,000 brands, including L’Oréal and Samsonite.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The combined company will compete in the same category as players such as Optimizely and Adobe, giving Singapore-headquartered Everstone and Wingify a larger footprint in Europe while deepening the merged platform’s product suite across testing, feature delivery, and AI-led personalization, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal adds to a growing wave of consolidation in marketing and product software, as private equity firms and strategic buyers look to assemble scaled, AI-ready platforms serving global enterprise customers. A recent PitchBook report shows enterprise SaaS M&amp;A surged to <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pe-is-fueling-the-surge-in-enterprise-saas-m-a-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">270 deals in Q3 worth $65 billion</a>, with deal volumes up 26.2% quarter-over-quarter and private equity accounting for 66.7% of deals. More broadly, PwC last year <a href=\"https://www.pwc.dk/da/publikationer/2025/pwc-private-equity-trend-report-2025-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">flagged</a> (PDF) consolidation as a key value-creation strategy for private equity firms, and EY highlighted <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_in/insights/mergers-acquisitions/connecting-the-dots-m-a-deals-in-the-technology-services-in-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sustained private equity-led momentum in tech M&amp;A</a> in 2024 as buyers pursue platform scale and AI capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupta told TechCrunch that Everstone will retain majority control of the combined business and hold majority board rights following the transaction. The board will have five to six seats in total, including representation from Everstone and Gupta, alongside three to four independent directors, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Everstone said it will back the combined company with additional support, including an advisory board of industry experts and operators. “Together, VWO and ABTasty will have among the most comprehensive product offerings in the category,” said Sandeep Singh, managing director at Everstone Capital.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Few are going to miss it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As industry watchers might remember, Facebook <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/\">rebranded</a> itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/\">Cambridge Analytica</a>; reports from Facebook whistleblower <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/\">Frances Haugen</a>, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/what-zuckerbergs-congressional-testimony-doesnt-say/\">spread of misinformation</a>; its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/you-dont-think-you-have-a-monopoly-read-sen-grahams-delightful-grilling-of-zuckerberg/\">monopolistic</a> practices, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/metas-horizon-worlds-is-available-in-the-us-and-canada-for-18-users/\">Meta’s Horizon Worlds</a> app and played games on their VR headsets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to CNBC, some of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/13/meta-lays-off-vr-employees-underscoring-zuckerbergs-pivot-to-ai.html\">casualties</a> include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.armature.com/games/resident-evil-4/\">Resident Evil 4 VR</a>“), Twisted Pixel (“<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twistedpixelgames.com/games/\">Marvel’s Deadpool VR</a>“), and Sanzaru (“<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sanzaru.com/games/asgards-wrath/\">Asgard’s Wrath</a>). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/meta-facebook-is-buying-within-creators-of-the-supernatural-vr-fitness-app/\">Meta acquired</a> in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/09/meta-acquires-within-despite-ftc-concerns/\">2023</a> for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-initiates-probe-into-metas-400-mln-vr-deal-supernatural-information-2021-12-17/\">$400 million</a>, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2026/meta-layoffs-hit-seattle-area-vr-studio-camouflaj-developer-behind-batman-game/\">by GeekWire</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And last week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/863209/meta-has-discontinued-its-metaverse-for-work-too\">The Verge</a> noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meta.com/help/quest/2464765133873078/\">is shutting down</a>, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/meta-reportedly-plans-to-slash-metaverse-budget-by-up-to-30/\">was slashing</a> the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/meta-is-pausing-its-dream-of-sharing-quests-horizon-os-with-third-party-headset-makers/\">pausing its program</a> to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/27/meta-facebook-q1-2022-earnings/\">lost</a> money at an excessive rate, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/03/metas-reality-labs-lost-13-7-billion-on-vr-and-ar-last-year/\">worrying</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/meta-revenue-decline-q3-2022-metaverse/\">investors</a>, and had never turned a profit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, the company had funneled some <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/employment/meta-makes-drastic-workforce-decision-after-73-billion-in-losses\">$73 billion</a> into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-building-in-the-open-fails\">“Building in the open” fails</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2023/growing-consumer-and-business-interest-in-the-metaverse-expected-to-fuel-trillion-dollar-opportunity-for-commerce-accenture-finds\">being</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/04/01/citi-metaverse-economy-13-trillion-2030/\">overhyped</a> by investors and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/value-creation-in-the-metaverse\">analysts</a> alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-memes/\">metaverse selfie</a> of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/19/mark-i-sure-hope-it-isnt/\">was so bad it even became a viral meme</a>. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Mark Zuckerberg avatar\" class=\"wp-image-2379511\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg 2148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=768,531 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=1200,829 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=1280,884 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=430,297 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=720,497 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=900,622 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=800,553 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=1536,1061 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=2048,1415 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=668,462 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=543,375 543w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=893,617 893w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=708,489 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology.

(Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/13/meta-plans-to-take-a-nearly-50percent-cut-on-nft-sales-in-its-metaverse.html\">a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets</a> within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself.

As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/04/meta-adds-personal-boundaries-to-horizon-worlds-and-venues-to-fight-harassment/\">rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature</a>, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/18/metaverse-new-venue-sexual-harassment-facebook\">experiencing</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60247542\">sexual harassment</a> in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/05/metaverse-sexual-assault-vr-game-online-safety-meta\">virtual rape</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/02/06/preventing-another-gang-rape-is-facebook-s-new-tool-enough-to-stop-sexual-assault-in-the-m\">gang rape</a> in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/14/meta-to-allow-horizon-worlds-users-to-turn-their-avatars-personal-safety-boundary-off-despite-virtual-world-sexual-assaults/\">later dialed back the safety feature a bit </a>by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2283968\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/code-of-conduct-for-virtual-experiences/\">a metaverse code of conduct</a> was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/metas-diversity-report-2022/\">reflect the makeup of Meta overall</a>, so it’s not a bad bet!)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ar-mixed-reality-and-ai-proved-more-popular\">AR, mixed reality, and AI proved more popular</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/ray-ban-meta-review/\">features</a> like the ability to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/10/the-near-joy-of-biking-with-ray-ban-meta-glasses/\">record hands-free</a>, stream music, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/ray-ban-meta-glasses-new-ai-features-and-partner-integrations/\">chat with Meta AI</a>, the glasses began to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/metas-smart-glasses-outsell-traditional-ray-bans-in-some-stores-even-before-ai-features-roll-out/\">outsell traditional Ray-Bans</a> in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-said-to-discuss-doubling-ray-ban-glasses-output-after-surge-in-demand\">doubling the output of the glasses</a> to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Meta Ray-Ban display\" class=\"wp-image-3047721\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Meta Ray-Ban display</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta / Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With an eye on AI, the company more recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/\">introduced Ray-Ban Display last year</a>, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens.

According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user’s inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the agent’s mind, it’s doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/the-multi-billion-ai-security-problem-enterprises-cant-ignore/\">week’s episode of Equity</a>. “It’s trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meftah’s example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom’s AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal — make paperclips — to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2408.04667v5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">non-deterministic nature </a>of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Misaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic’s portfolio company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/witnessai-is-building-guardrails-for-generative-ai-models/\">Witness AI</a> is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Witness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI’s fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren’t going rogue, aren’t deleting files, aren’t doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise — and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks — analyst <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-cybersecurity-become-ais-trillion-dollar-lisa-warren-p9evf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lisa Warren predicts</a> that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As to how such startups plan to compete with big players like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-sagemaker-data-ai-governance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AWS</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/new-enhanced-tool-governance-in-vertex-ai-agent-builder/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/ai-data-governance-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Salesforce</a>, and others that have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there’s room for many approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Caccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn’t easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat <em>them</em>?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For his part, Caccia doesn’t want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrikes-rivals-stand-to-benefit-from-its-update-fail-debacle/\">CrowdStrike did it in endpoint</a> [protection]. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/splunk-expands-machine-learning-capabilities-across-platform/\">Splunk</a> did it in SIEM. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/04/okta-plans-to-weave-ai-across-its-entire-identity-platform/\">Okta</a> did it in identity,” he said. “Someone comes through and stands next to the big guys…and we built Witness to do that from Day One.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
