This comes months after the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/a16z-pauses-its-famed-txo-fund-for-underserved-founders-lays-off-staff/?_thumbnail_id=3064752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">firm paused TxO and laid off most of its staff</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work,” Ampadu wrote in the email, sent Friday afternoon, with the subject line “Closing My a16z Chapter.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ampadu led the program, which launched in 2020, for over four years until its pause last November, taking over for the initial leader, Nait Jones. Afterward, Ampadu <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/kofi-ampadu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">seems to have worked at a16z’s</a> latest accelerator, Speedrun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ampadu’s departure perhaps signals the end of the TxO chapter. The fund and program focused on supporting underserved founders by providing access to tech networks and investment capital through a donor-advised fund. Though some founders spoke highly of the program, others criticized the controversial donor-advised structure. The program also launched a grant program in 2024 to provide $50,000 to nonprofits that help diverse founders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its last cohort was in March 2025, and its indefinite pause came as many top tech names reframe, cut, or eliminate prior public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We’ve reached out to a16z and Ampadu for comment. <br><br>His full note below:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I moved to the United States three months before my 11th birthday. One month later, I started 6th grade in a school more than 5,000 miles from my home, my friends, and everything familiar. Recently, my mom reminded me that my school required me to enroll as an English-as-a-Second-Language student. My memory immediately returned to how confused I felt. Even at 10 years old, I knew it made no sense that a kid from Ghana, an English-speaking country, was being asked to learn a language he already spoke fluently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was a systems requirement, a blanketed assumption about what students from certain places could or could not do. That same type of systemic assumption is what we set out to challenge through the Talent x Opportunity Initiative. The venture ecosystem often relies on proxies such as schools, networks, and prior credentials, which can obscure exceptional founders who do not follow the most common paths. TxO invested in and supported these overlooked founders to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work. Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As I move on to my next chapter, I leave with pride in what we built and gratitude for everyone who helped shape it. Thank you for the trust, the collaboration, and the belief in what is possible. There is more work to do and I am excited to keep building.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From the street, the only indication I’ve found Physical Intelligence’s headquarters in San Francisco is a pi symbol that’s a slightly different color than the rest of the door. When I walk in, I’m immediately confronted with activity. There’s no reception desk, no gleaming logo in fluorescent lights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inside, the space is a giant concrete box made slightly less austere by a haphazard sprawl of long blonde-wood tables. Some are clearly meant for lunch, dotted with Girl Scout cookie boxes, jars of Vegemite (someone here is Australian), and small wire baskets stuffed with one too many condiments. The rest of the tables tell a different story entirely. Many more of them are laden with monitors, spare robotics parts, tangles of black wire, and fully assembled robotic arms in various states of attempting to master the mundane.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During my visit, one arm is folding a pair of black pants, or trying to. It’s not going well. Another is attempting to turn a shirt inside out with the kind of determination that suggests it will eventually succeed, just not today. A third — this one seems to have found its calling — is quickly peeling a zucchini, after which it is supposed to deposit the shavings into a separate container. The shavings are going well, at least.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Think of it like ChatGPT, but for robots,” Sergey Levine tells me, gesturing toward the motorized ballet unfolding across the room. Levine, an associate professor at UC Berkeley and one of Physical Intelligence’s co-founders, has the amiable, bespectacled demeanor of someone who has spent considerable time explaining complex concepts to people who don’t immediately grasp them. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3088330\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Connie Loizos for TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What I’m watching, he explains, is the testing phase of a continuous loop: data gets collected on robot stations here and at other locations — warehouses, homes, wherever the team can set up shop — and that data trains general-purpose robotic foundation models. When researchers train a new model, it comes back to stations like these for evaluation. The pants-folder is someone’s experiment. So is the shirt-turner. The zucchini-peeler might be testing whether the model can generalize across different vegetables, learning the fundamental motions of peeling well enough to handle an apple or a potato it’s never encountered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://www.pi.website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">company</a> also operates a test kitchen in this building and elsewhere using off-the-shelf hardware to expose the robots to different environments and challenges. There’s a sophisticated espresso machine nearby, and I assume it’s for the staff until Levine clarifies that no, it’s there for the robots to learn. Any foamed lattes are data, not a perk for the dozens of engineers on the scene who are mostly peering into their computers or hovering over their mechanized experiments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hardware itself is deliberately unglamorous. These arms sell for about $3,500, and that’s with what Levine describes as “an enormous markup” from the vendor. If they manufactured them in-house, the material cost would drop below $1,000. A few years ago, he says, a roboticist would have been shocked these things could do anything at all. But that’s the point — good intelligence compensates for bad hardware.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Levine excuses himself, I’m approached by Lachy Groom, moving through the space with the purposefulness of someone who has half a dozen things happening at once. At 31, Groom still has the fresh-faced quality of Silicon Valley’s boy wonder, a designation he earned early, having sold his first company nine months after starting it at age 13 in his native Australia (this explains the Vegemite).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first approached him earlier, as he welcomed a small gaggle of sweatshirt-wearing visitors into the building, his response to my request for time with him was immediate: “Absolutely not, I’ve got meetings.” Now he has 10 minutes, maybe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Groom found what he was looking for when he started following the academic work coming out of the labs of Levine and Chelsea Finn, a former Berkeley PhD student of Levine’s who now runs her own lab at Stanford focused on robotic learning. Their names kept appearing in everything interesting happening in robotics. When he heard rumors they might be starting something, he tracked down Karol Hausman, a Google DeepMind researcher who also taught at Stanford and who Groom had learned was involved. “It was just one of those meetings where you walk out and it’s like, This is it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Groom never intended to become a full-time investor, he tells me, even though some might wonder why not given his track record. After leaving Stripe, where he was an early employee, he spent roughly five years as an angel investor, making early bets on companies like Figma, Notion, Ramp, and Lattice while searching for the right company to start or join himself. His first robotics investment, Standard Bots, came in 2021 and reintroduced him to a field he’d loved as a kid building Lego Mindstorms. As he jokes, he was “on vacation much more as an investor.” But investing was just a way to stay active and meet people, not the endgame. “I was looking for five years for the company to go start post-Stripe,” he says. “Good ideas at a good time with a good team — [that’s] extremely rare. It’s all execution, but you can execute like hell on a bad idea, and it’s still a bad idea.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3088332\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Connie Loizos for TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two-year-old company has now raised <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-20/robotics-startup-physical-intelligence-valued-at-5-6-billion-in-new-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over $1 billion</a>, and when I ask about its runway, he’s quick to clarify it doesn’t actually burn that much. Most of its spending goes toward compute. A moment later, he acknowledges that under the right terms, with the right partners, he’d raise more. “There’s no limit to how much money we can really put to work,” he says. “There’s always more compute you can throw at the problem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What makes this arrangement particularly unusual is what Groom doesn’t give his backers: a timeline for turning Physical Intelligence into a money-making endeavor. “I don’t give investors answers on commercialization,” he says of backers that include Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital among others that have valued the company at $5.6 billion. “That’s sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that.” But tolerate it they do, and they may not always, which is why it behooves the company to be well-capitalized now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So what’s the strategy, if not commercialization? Quan Vuong, another co-founder who came from Google DeepMind, explains that it revolves around cross-embodiment learning and diverse data sources. If someone builds a new hardware platform tomorrow, they won’t need to start data collection from scratch — they can transfer all the knowledge the model already has. “The marginal cost of onboarding autonomy to a new robot platform, whatever that platform might be, it’s just a lot lower,” he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is already working with a small number of companies in different verticals — logistics, grocery, a chocolate maker across the street — to test whether their systems are good enough for real-world automation. Vuong claims that in some cases, they already are. With their “any platform, any task” approach, the surface area for success is large enough to start checking off tasks that are ready for automation today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Physical Intelligence isn’t alone in chasing this vision. The race to build general-purpose robotic intelligence — the foundation on which more specialized applications can be built, much like the LLM models that captivated the world three years ago — is heating up. Pittsburgh-based Skild AI, founded in 2023, just this month raised $1.4 billion at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/robotic-software-maker-skild-ai-hits-14b-valuation/\">$14 billion valuation</a> and is taking a notably different approach. While Physical Intelligence remains focused on pure research, Skild AI has already deployed its “omni-bodied” Skild Brain commercially, saying it generated $30 million in revenue in just a few months last year across security, warehouses, and manufacturing. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3088334\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Connie Loizos for TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Skild has even taken public shots at competitors, <a href=\"https://www.skild.ai/blogs/building-the-general-purpose-robotic-brain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">arguing on its blog</a> that most “robotics foundation models” are just vision-language models “in disguise” that lack “true physical common sense” because they rely too heavily on internet-scale pretraining rather than physics-based simulation and real robotics data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a pretty sharp philosophical divide. Skild AI is betting that commercial deployment creates a data flywheel that improves the model with each real-world use case. Physical Intelligence is betting that resisting the pull of near-term commercialization will enable it to produce superior general intelligence. Who’s “more right” will take years to resolve.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Physical Intelligence operates with what Groom describes as unusual clarity. “It’s such a pure company. A researcher has a need, we go and collect data to support that need — or new hardware or whatever it is — and then we do it. It’s not externally driven.” The company had a 5- to 10-year roadmap of what the team thought would be possible. By month 18, they’d blown through it, he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has about 80 employees and plans to grow, though Groom says hopefully “as slowly as possible.” What’s the most challenging, he says, is hardware. “Hardware is just really hard. Everything we do is so much harder than a software company.” Hardware breaks. It arrives slowly, delaying tests. Safety considerations complicate everything.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Groom springs up to rush to his next commitment, I’m left watching the robots continue their practice. The pants are still not quite folded. The shirt remains stubbornly right-side-out. The zucchini shavings are piling up nicely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are obvious questions, including my own, about whether anyone actually wants a robot in their kitchen peeling vegetables, about safety, about dogs going crazy at mechanical intruders in their homes, about whether all of the time and money being invested here solves big enough problems or creates new ones. Meanwhile, outsiders question the company’s progress, whether its vision is achievable, and if betting on general intelligence rather than specific applications makes sense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Groom has any doubts, he doesn’t show it. He’s working with people who’ve been working on this problem for decades and who believe the timing is finally right, which is all he needs to know. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides, Silicon Valley has been backing people like Groom and giving them a lot of rope since the beginning of the industry, knowing there’s a good chance that even without a clear path to commercialization, even without a timeline, even without certainty about what the market will look like when they get there, they’ll figure it out. It doesn’t always work out. But when it does, it tends to justify a lot of the times it didn’t.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Last year, the New York Post <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/business/reclusive-onlyfans-owner-looks-to-cash-out-but-adult-site-may-not-fetch-top-dollar-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported that</a> Leonid Radvinsky, the billionaire owner of the site, was looking to “cash out,” and was courting potential buyers. Subsequent <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/onlyfans-owner-talks-sell-investor-group-about-8-billion-value-sources-say-2025-05-22/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting</a> showed that the platform’s parent company, Fenix International Ltd., was in talks with a U.S.-based investor group led by the Los Angeles-based investment firm Forest Road Company. It’s unclear what happened to those discussions, although the source told TechCrunch that there had been a number of interested parties since OnlyFans announced its desire to sell a majority stake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potential business partner in this particular deal, Architect, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/architect-capital-brings-alternative-capital-to-the-early-stage-with-new-100m-fund/\">launched in 2021</a> as an asset-based lender — a firm that provides loans secured by company assets — that looks to partner with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation/\">early-stage startups</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OnlyFans maintains that it’s not a pornography website, despite the fact that a majority of the creators on it produce adult content. A British firm, the site was founded in 2016 by Tim Stokely, who also initially served as its CEO. Stokely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f034e311-942e-4d4f-a970-81ee54c568a3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sold a majority stake</a> of the site’s parent company, Fenix International, to Radvinsky in 2018. Over the years, it has suffered from a variety of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/onlyfans-sex-trafficking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legal controversies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/onlyfans-sex-legal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">including lawsuits</a> accusing the site of profiting off of abusive videos.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The viral personal AI assistant formerly known as Clawdbot has a new name — again. After a legal challenge from Claude’s maker, Anthropic, it had briefly rebranded as Moltbot, but has now settled on OpenClaw as its new name.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest name change wasn’t prompted by Anthropic, which declined to comment. But this time, Clawdbot’s original creator Peter Steinberger made sure to avoid copyright issues from the start. “I got someone to help with researching trademarks for OpenClaw and also asked OpenAI for permission just to be sure,” the Austrian developer told TechCrunch via email.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The lobster has molted into its final form,” Steinberger wrote in a <a href=\"https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. Molting — the process through which lobsters grow — had also inspired OpenClaw’s previous name, but Steinberger confessed <a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2017106396483833900\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on X</a> that the short-lived moniker “never grew” on him, and others agreed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This quick name change highlights the project’s youth, even as it has attracted over 100,000 GitHub stars (a measure of popularity on the software development platform) in just two months. According to Steinberger, OpenClaw’s new name is a nod to its roots and community. “This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The OpenClaw community has already spawned creative offshoots, including Moltbook — a social network where AI assistants can interact with each other. The platform has attracted significant attention from AI researchers and developers. Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s former AI director, called the phenomenon “genuinely the most incredible <a href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/2017296988589723767?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing</a> I have seen recently,” noting that “People’s Clawdbots (moltbots, now OpenClaw) are self-organizing on a Reddit-like site for AIs, discussing various topics, e.g. even how to speak privately.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">British programmer Simon Willison described Moltbook as “the most interesting place on the internet right now” in a <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/30/moltbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post on Friday</a>. On the platform, AI agents share information on topics ranging from automating Android phones via remote access to analyzing webcam streams. The platform operates through a skill system, or downloadable instruction files that tell OpenClaw assistants how to interact with the network. Willison noted that agents post to forums called “Submolts” and even have a built-in mechanism to check the site every four hours for updates, though he cautioned this “fetch and follow instructions from the internet” approach carries inherent security risks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steinberger had taken a break after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/pspdfkit-raises-116m-its-first-outside-money-now-nearly-1b-people-use-apps-powered-by-its-collaboration-signing-and-markup-tools/\">exiting his former company PSPDFkit</a>, but “came back from retirement to mess with AI,” per his X bio. Clawdbot stemmed from the personal projects he developed then, but OpenClaw is no longer a solo endeavor. “I added quite a few people from the open source community to the list of maintainers this week,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That additional support will be key for OpenClaw to reach its full potential. Its ambition is to let users have an AI assistant that runs on their own computer and works from the chat apps they already use. But until it ramps up its security, it is still inadvisable to run it outside of a controlled environment, let alone give it access to your main Slack or WhatsApp accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steinberger is well aware of these concerns, and thanked “all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project.” Commenting on OpenClaw’s roadmap, he wrote that “security remains our top priority” and noted that the latest version, released along with the rebrand, already includes some improvements on that front.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even with external help, there are problems that are too big for OpenClaw to solve on its own, such as prompt injection, where a malicious message could trick AI models into taking unintended actions. “Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem,” Steinberger wrote, while directing users to a <a href=\"https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">set of security best practices</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These security best practices require significant technical expertise, which reinforces that OpenClaw is currently best suited for early tinkerers, not mainstream users lured by the promise of an “AI assistant that does things.” As the hype around the project has grown, Steinberger and his supporters have become increasingly vocal in their warnings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a message posted on Discord by one of OpenClaw’s top maintainers, who goes by the nickname of Shadow, “if you can’t understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely. This isn’t a tool that should be used by the general public at this time.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truly going mainstream will take time and money, and OpenClaw has now started to accept sponsors, with lobster-themed tiers ranging from “krill” ($5/month) to “poseidon” ($500/month). But its sponsorship page makes it clear that Steinberger “doesn’t keep sponsorship funds.” Instead, he is currently “figuring out how to pay maintainers properly — full-time if possible.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Likely helped by Steinberger’s pedigree and vision, OpenClaw’s roster of sponsors includes software engineers and entrepreneurs who have founded and built other well-known projects, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Morin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Path’s Dave Morin</a> and Ben Tossell, who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/zapier-buys-no-code-focused-makerpad-in-its-first-acquisition/\">sold his company Makerpad to Zapier</a> in 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tossell, who now describes himself as a tinkerer and investor, sees value in putting AI’s potential in people’s hands. “We need to back people like Peter who are building open source tools anyone can pick up and use,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The informant told the FBI that Epstein’s hacker sold a zero-day to Hezbollah, which paid him with “a trunk of cash.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per the informant, the hacker “was very good at finding vulnerabilities.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Jeffrey Epstein’s “personal hacker”?

The company says the feature is still in the early stages and is not being tested publicly yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The social network’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/instagram-brings-close-friends-feature-to-the-main-feed/\">Close Friends</a> feature lets users share Stories, Reels, and posts with a select group of people, rather than their entire follower base. Since the feature’s launch in 2018, users haven’t been able to remove themselves from someone else’s Close Friends list.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The internal prototype was first spotted by reverse engineer <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/2016898237207134249\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who specializes in finding unreleased features while they’re still under development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a screenshot shared by Paluzzi, Meta will warn users that if they leave a Close Friends list, they won’t be able to see that person’s Close Friends content unless that person adds them back to their list.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some people would undoubtedly feel offended if others leave their Close Friends list, the feature would likely be a welcome addition for those who’d rather not be included on certain people’s lists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Snapchat, one of Instagram’s main competitors, already allows its users to remove themselves from someone’s private story — a similar feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with any other internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Instagram plans to release the feature publicly. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond Close Friends updates, Instagram is also working on other new features. Meta told TechCrunch earlier this week that it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/meta-to-test-premium-subscriptions-on-instagram-facebook-and-whatsapp/\">plans to test new subscriptions</a> that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Meta didn’t share details about which specific features these subscriptions will include, Paluzzi shared that a premium subscription on Instagram will allow users to create unlimited audience lists, see which followers don’t follow them back, and view Stories without the poster knowing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta said its goal with the upcoming subscriptions is to give users access to special features and more control over how they share and connect, while keeping the core experiences free. The company doesn’t appear to be locked into one strategy, as it plans to test a variety of subscription features and bundles with each app subscription offering a distinct set of exclusive features.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company had previously suggested it was going to use the third New Glenn launch to send its robotic lunar lander to the moon, but that spacecraft is still undergoing testing at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since retaking office, President Donald Trump has put pressure on NASA to send astronauts back to the moon before the end of his second term. That has cleared the way for companies other than SpaceX to compete for these missions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The decision reflects Blue Origin’s commitment to the nation’s goal of returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent, sustained lunar presence,” the company wrote Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blue Origin first flew the New Shepard rocket more than a decade ago, and it became the first rocket to go to space and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/24/9790510/blue-origin-reusable-rockets-vertical-landing-spacex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">safely land back on Earth</a>. Unlike SpaceX’s Falcon 9, though, the New Shepard rocket was never intended to reach Earth orbit. Its utility has therefore been limited to space tourism flights, which allow passengers around four minutes of weightlessness in Blue Origin’s space capsule, and science missions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said Friday that New Shepard has flown 38 times and carried 98 humans to space, along with more than 200 scientific and research payloads. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New Shepard program was previously paused in 2022 after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/12/blue-origin-launch-aborted-after-mid-flight-anomaly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one of the company’s boosters exploded mid-flight</a>.

I am also the founder of a secondary firm that buys private company shares called Archer Capital Group, and co-founder of Liquid Stock, a business that helps employees and executives exercise their options using their shares as collateral. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-i-m-sure-the-secondaries-business-has-been-booming-with-this-ipo-drought-from-the-past-couple-years\"><strong>I’m sure the secondaries business has been booming with this IPO drought from the past couple years.</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No doubt. Private companies are staying private much longer now. Many of these businesses — including SpaceX and other companies that would be top 30 in the S&amp;P 500 — would historically have gone public years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies are significant in our economy, and investors really want access to these companies. At the same time, there are shareholders and executives and founders who have been in them for a long time and want to start seeing some liquidity from their shares, which are a very high percentage of their net worth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So these two forces have created a thriving secondary market. And we only see this trend growing because more market cap is now housed in the private markets.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-imagine-the-secondary-markets-shifting-if-we-have-a-break-in-ipos-this-year\"><strong>Do you imagine the secondary markets shifting if we have a break in IPOs this year?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an interesting question, because clearly when a SpaceX goes public, you could argue that $800 billion has just left the private system and is now in the public markets. But I think it just increases interest in more companies offering liquidity, and more investors coming into private markets. While SpaceX is a one-of-kind company, there are a lot of companies that are being started today and that are growing very fast. I mean, three or four years ago, what were OpenAI and Anthropic valued at? Those are now over a trillion dollars of combined market cap. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I really see the trend of the opportunity in the private secondary spaces as growing overall, and frankly, when we see the matriculation of SpaceX to the public markets, I think it’s going to actually increase the capital market interest in private companies.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-some-things-you-re-noticing-around-the-spacex-ipo\"><strong>What are some things you’re noticing around the SpaceX IPO?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you think about the IPO market the last few years, it’s been pretty dismal since 2021, so the markets are really waiting for a bellwether company. And I think SpaceX is clearly a bellwether company…and there’s a huge amount of interest in that company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX also just did a tender at an $800 billion valuation, and we see a ton of interest on our platform at Rainmaker in continuing to buy into the secondary. And it’s not just SpaceX. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re seeing a lot of interest in some of the other bellwether companies, whether it’s ByteDance, whether it’s Stripe, Databricks, obviously OpenAI, Anthropic, the AI businesses, Perplexity. So there is a lot of interest, but SpaceX, I think, is the one that people are following the most closely. And I really think it could create a reset in the IPO market if it were to go public this year.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-kind-of-bid-movement-are-you-seeing-on-your-platform\"><strong>What kind of bid movement are you seeing on your platform?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has continued to defy gravity. Even during the down periods of ‘22 and ‘23, SpaceX was the one company that continued to price up every time there was a hint of the company going public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We have seen a significant uptick in interest, both from a size and a price point — it’s already pricing well above where the last tender round was and getting closer to that trillion and a half that they had discussed as a potential IPO price.  </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-elon-musk-famously-said-he-wouldn-t-take-spacex-public-until-rockets-were-flying-to-mars-regularly-why-is-he-racing-to-the-public-markets-now\"><strong>Elon Musk famously said he wouldn’t take SpaceX public </strong><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-elon-musk-is-racing-to-take-spacex-public-38f3de9b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfq0GfzojoJ-k3M7XZBNp__L48XVCpA0_sqJY4wLcZuGqsMGks9anL8I2wHfwM%3D&amp;gaa_ts=697780c0&amp;gaa_sig=pAYkhG2WVQzZ8OQxNyY9mDBVhWjsopXzG5vt-lfpYqRv0cdDx4LO9CQBP38AO1Oa4hZxqtvrHn_Domszvfpm3Q%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>until rockets were flying</strong></a><strong> to Mars regularly. Why is he racing to the public markets now?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been private for a long time, so I wouldn’t say he’s racing to go public, although his stance has shifted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We are in a very good market, we’re at all-time highs across the board. SpaceX has seen a large amount of interest in the private markets, but the private markets are constrained. Not every investor on the planet can access the private markets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has a huge opportunity in front of it. They dominate the rocket-launching business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They’re building an amazing Starlink business. They have Starship, which has so many businesses related to it, whether it’s sending bulk payloads into space or logistics around the world. Now they’re talking about building data centers in space, and as a truly vertically integrated company, they can manage it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And so it just makes sense, given the positive market dynamics and massive potential opportunity that SpaceX could address across its many business lines. Why not go and unlock all the rest of the capital markets to help them fund their businesses?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-spacex-has-been-traditionally-pretty-tight-about-who-can-join-its-cap-table-there-are-a-lot-of-national-security-risks-so-they-can-t-have-any-links-to-u-s-adversaries-will-opening-up-to-the-public-markets-affect-that-nbsp-nbsp\"><strong>SpaceX has been traditionally pretty tight about who can join its cap table. There are a lot of national security risks so they can’t have any links to U.S. adversaries. Will opening up to the public markets affect that?  </strong><strong> </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You could argue that it does open up that potential risk channel. I think if they do a public offering, it’ll probably be a sliver deal, so only 5% of their company that’s technically available. Now we’ll see what happens, but at least things will be out in the open and publicly disclosed, so they can see who owns their shares. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question will then become, do any of these companies — even if they’re in adversarial countries — have any real control? If they’re just economic interests, that’s something that can be tolerated. The reality is, Elon and a pretty tight-knit group of people will still continue to control the company. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-you-said-it-s-not-a-race-to-ipo-but-it-certainly-feels-that-way-now-in-part-because-of-elon-musk-s-public-feud-with-sam-altman-who-is-also-chasing-close-to-a-1-trillion-ipo-altman-is-also-looking-to-buy-stoke-space-while-bezos-is-talking-about-orbital-data-centers-a-lot-of-rivals-appear-to-be-converging-on-a-similar-mission-nbsp\"><strong>You said it’s not a race to IPO, but it certainly feels that way now, in part because of Elon Musk’s public feud with Sam Altman, who is also chasing close to a $1 trillion IPO. Altman is also looking to buy Stoke Space, while Bezos is talking about orbital data centers. A lot of rivals appear to be converging on a similar mission. </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX’s success is going to breed some imitation. We’ve heard now that Bezos is going to launch a communication network to compete with Starlink, but they’re a long way behind. And OpenAI has its own set of capital risks in the core business that they have to address. So for them to go public makes a ton of sense, because the AI trade is still very hot in the public markets. They have an insatiable need for capital right now, if you look at their burn rate. So there’s no point in them constraining the investors that can access their company, because right now they need capital. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think SpaceX can be a little more measured. They can find the right time when the market presents itself well, because they have a business that is largely profitable, and they have dominance in their two key businesses. So they’re in the driver’s seat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If there’s any downdraft in the market, I think they’ll stay private. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-not-all-roses-for-spacex-they-are-facing-their-own-challenges-launching-starship-v3-and-several-of-their-aircraft-have-exploded-over-the-past-year-but-a-lot-of-that-might-not-matter-since-this-is-an-elon-musk-company-and-those-tend-to-do-well-in-terms-of-stock-price-just-off-the-back-of-his-name-how-do-you-think-the-spacex-ipo-will-be-priced-relative-to-what-its-actual-balance-sheet-says-versus-the-impact-of-elon-musk-and-his-empire-nbsp\"><strong>It’s not all roses for SpaceX. They are facing their own </strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/spacex-eyes-mid-march-for-first-test-of-upgraded-starship-rocket/\"><strong>challenges</strong></a><strong> launching Starship V3, and several of their aircraft have exploded over the past year. But a lot of that might not matter since this is an Elon Musk company, and those tend to do well in terms of stock price just off the back of his name. How do you think the SpaceX IPO will be priced relative to what its actual balance sheet says, versus the impact of Elon Musk and his empire? </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It will definitely get a premium multiple. There’s an Elon halo effect, and he’s delivered. Even though Tesla’s primary revenues come from automobiles, it’s completely vertically integrated. It captures data. It now has self-driving taxis. It has Optimus robots –</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-got-a-minimal-rollout-of-self-driving-taxis-and-optimus-is-still-years-away\"><strong>It’s got a minimal rollout of self-driving taxis and Optimus is still years away…</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robots are the future at Tesla. Tesla is really a state of the art manufacturing company, and Elon owns xAI, Twitter, SpaceX — these companies can be very virtuous. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I do think there’s a halo effect around Elon and that creates some pressure, too. So I expect he will get a premium well and above what typical market rates would be for a company like SpaceX, given their balance sheet and revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think people believe in the future of a data center in space that’s cooled by space and run by solar panels directly from the sun. I mean, it sounds crazy and pie in the sky, just like going to Mars sounds crazy and pie in the sky. But if anyone can do it, Elon’s probably the guy.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-you-say-that-but-he-hasn-t-actually-done-a-lot-of-the-weird-pie-in-the-sky-stuff-that-he-has-promised-to-do-in-fact-others-have-beat-him-to-the-punch-especially-when-it-comes-to-full-self-driving-nbsp\"><strong>You say that, but he hasn’t actually done a lot of the weird pie in the sky stuff that he has promised to do. In fact, others have beat him to the punch, especially when it comes to full self-driving. </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That will be debated by investors and will be where the tension is. When you put so much value in the belief that one person can exceed expectations continuously, that’s a big challenge. And some people will not be comfortable with that risk. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-significant-is-it-that-spacex-is-lining-up-banks-for-a-2026-ipo\"><strong>How significant is it that SpaceX is lining up banks for a 2026 IPO?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a pretty big signal. I don’t think they’re just playing games.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-but-having-a-conversation-with-banks-doesn-t-necessarily-mean-the-ipo-is-coming-this-year-what-are-some-other-signals-that-people-could-watch-for-when-a-company-is-getting-ready-to-go-public-not-just-spacex-but-anyone\"><strong>But having a conversation with banks doesn’t necessarily mean the IPO is coming this year. What are some other signals that people could watch for when a company is getting ready to go public — not just SpaceX, but anyone?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Look at the people they hire and if that portends more of an IPO senior executive team versus an entrepreneurial team. If they seem really focused on a chief accounting officer from a public company. Or if there’s a swap out and a new CFO comes in with deep public company experience. If they’re beefing up their investor relations team, accounting, legal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies like SpaceX have had public-grade teams for a while, so I don’t think there’s a lot to learn there.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-zooming-out-a-little-bit-how-would-you-say-private-market-valuations-typically-compare-to-what-companies-achieve-in-their-ipos\"><strong>Zooming out a little bit, how would you say private-market valuations typically compare to what companies achieve in their IPOs?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a good sign for private companies to pre-understand their demand. If a company didn’t have that and they basically had to rely on a two-week marketing period from when they file publicly or if they start a road show where they only talk to top accountants, that’s often when you have a really difficult pricing environment because they’re not getting proper price discovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So we’re really pushing companies to actually open up your private secondary capability because it’s a great way to develop price discovery well in advance of the IPO, to start getting people attached to your business, to open yourself up to a broader investor base. That way, by the time you do go on your road show, you actually have a pretty good view of what your price should be, and you end up with a much more efficient IPO. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Think about when Figma went public and traded up 200% — that’s not really a good IPO. That’s a company that probably didn’t do very good price discovery in advance. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-walk-us-through-how-secondaries-actually-work-let-s-say-i-m-a-spacex-employee-with-stock-options-what-are-my-options-before-ipo-nbsp\"><strong>Walk us through how secondaries actually work. Let’s say I’m a SpaceX employee with stock options. What are my options before IPO? </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All private companies are not created equally. SpaceX has very tight controls on their cap table, partially because they don’t want to exceed the number of shareholders, at which point they would have to be a public company. And so Space X, unlike most companies, runs tender offers two or three times a year, so there tends to be a reasonable amount of liquidity for employees. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now there’s also what I would call the SPV (special purpose vehicle) world that trades in SpaceX, where people put their shares in SPVs and then trade units in their SPVs, rather than the shares themselves. So there actually isn’t a cap table change, but there is an economic ownership change by virtue of trading units in the SPV. That’s where most of the trading in SpaceX lies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whereas some companies allow trading of shares directly on their cap table, and some companies absolutely prohibit all secondary transactions, which I don’t think is a good idea. That’s why people work with firms like Rainmaker, because we get to know the companies. We get to know how they monitor and guard trades so we can help get those trades done. We can help provide liquidity for people who want it. We can provide either ownership of the shares or ownership in the economics of the shares for investors.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-you-say-access-to-information-is-one-of-an-investor-s-biggest-problems-in-the-secondary-markets-does-rainmaker-help-provide-information\"><strong>You say access to information is one of an investor’s biggest problems in the secondary markets. Does Rainmaker help provide information?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We work with some companies where we’re provided data rooms and can provide access to information. We do our own research on anything publicly available and have a view of supply and demand dynamics. So we have a lot of information we can provide, but we can’t share inside company information unless the company allows it. Increasingly, we’re helping companies with those processes. The more information we can provide, the lower the risk for investors, and that tends to open up markets. But it’s an evolving process. These are private companies for a reason — they’re guarded with what they want to share, and we’re very respectful of that.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-sophisticated-investors-looking-for-when-they-buy-pre-ipo-shares-at-this-scale\"><strong>What are sophisticated investors looking for when they buy pre-IPO shares at this scale?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just like a traditional investor, they would want to be able to do their due diligence across financials, across management. They certainly would like an understanding of the cap table — like how many shares are outstanding, what’s the preferences? What does this price represent? What’s the debt? They would love to understand what the supply and demand equilibrium is like.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more they have, the better. That’s why they’re more comfortable with more public-facing private companies, like SpaceX — even without exact historical financials — than the less well-known names.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-are-you-seeing-more-of-an-appetite-for-buying-secondary-shares-from-other-late-stage-unicorns-what-companies-would-you-point-to\"><strong>Are you seeing more of an appetite for buying secondary shares from other late-stage unicorns? What companies would you point to?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We continue to see substantial demand for companies like Databricks, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, ByteDance. The AI trade continues to be strong, whether it’s Lambda Labs or Cohere, which is a Canadian company near and dear to my heart. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As companies signal they’re going to go public — like Discord, Motive, Canva — people get a feeling that there’s going to be liquidity, and that’s when we start to see things open. There are probably 20 to 30 companies on our platform that trade pretty regularly, and that just continues to grow. As the IPO market starts to open up, we’re going to see that broaden. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like in 2021, we were trading hundreds of companies, and then as the IPO market closed, and that number compressed. But last year was our biggest year — we were trading over $1 billion worth of secondaries.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-can-our-listeners-connect-with-you-online\"><strong>Where can our listeners connect with you online?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m on LinkedIn.

Anthropic open sourced 11 of its in-house plug-ins as part of the release on Friday, but noted that custom plug-ins are “easy to build, edit, and share” and can be utilized without much technical expertise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plug-ins have already been <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">available within Claude Code</a> for some time, and their expansion into Cowork is merely designed to take that same utility and share it with different kinds of users. “Really, what we’re doing with this launch is just bringing them to Cowork and giving them that kind of user-friendly, UI-centric flavor that will allow the maximum number of people to use them,” Piccolella said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Piccolella pointed to data analysis and sales as two departments within Anthropic where plug-ins have already shown promise. “Sales has been a really big one, both for our direct sales people, but then also just getting anybody who’s kind of sales adjacent, better connected to the customer and customer feedback and all of that,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says that the more enterprise users utilize plug-ins, the more Claude knows about a company’s workflows and how to optimize them. Currently, plug-ins get saved locally to a user’s machine, although Anthropic says that an organization-wide sharing tool is on the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cowork, which just released about two weeks ago, is currently in its research preview. It’s unclear when it will launch more widely. For the time being, plug-ins will be available to all paying Claude customers, Anthropic says.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Of those, 235 million posts contained media, accounting for 62% of all media posts shared on Bluesky to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also reported a fivefold increase in legal requests from law enforcement agencies, government regulators, and legal representatives in 2025, with 1,470 requests, up from 238 requests in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the company previously shared moderation reports in <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2023</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-17-2025-moderation-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2024</a>, this is the first time it’s put together a comprehensive transparency report. The new report tackles other areas outside of moderation, like regulatory compliance and account verification information, among other things.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-moderation-reports-from-users-jump-54\"><strong>Moderation reports from users jump 54%</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compared with 2024, when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/bluesky-saw-17x-increase-in-moderation-reports-in-2024-after-rapid-growth/\">Bluesky saw a 17x increase</a> in moderation reports, the company this year reported a 54% increase, going from 6.48 million user reports in 2024 to 9.97 million in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the number jumped, Bluesky noted that the growth “closely tracked” its 57% user growth that occurred over the same period.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around 3% of the user base, or 1.24 million users, submitted reports in 2025, with the top categories being “misleading” (which includes spam) at 43.73% of the total, “harassment” at 19.93%, and sexual content at 13.54%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A catch-all “other” category included 22.14% of the reports that didn’t fall under these categories, or others like violence, child safety, breaking site rules, or self-harm, which accounted for much smaller percentages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the “misleading” category’s 4.36 million reports, spam accounted for 2.49 million reports.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, hate speech accounted for the largest share of the 1.99 million “harassment” reports, with about 55,400 reports. Other areas that saw activity included targeted harassment (about 42,520 reports), trolling (29,500 reports), and doxxing (about 3,170 reports).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Bluesky said that the majority of “harassment” reports included those that fell into the gray area of antisocial behavior, which may include rude remarks, but didn’t fit into the other categories, like hate speech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most of the sexual content reports (1.52 million) concerned mislabeling, Bluesky says, meaning that adult content was not properly marked with metadata — tags that allow users to control their own moderation experience using Bluesky’s tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A smaller number of reports focused on nonconsensual intimate imagery (about 7,520), abuse content (about 6,120), and deepfakes (over 2,000).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reports focused on violence (24,670 in total) were broken down into subcategories like threats or incitement (about 10,170 reports), glorification of violence (6,630 reports), and extremist content (3,230 reports).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to user reports, Bluesky’s automated system flagged 2.54 million potential violations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One area where Bluesky reported success involved a decline in daily reports of antisocial behavior on the site, which dropped 79% after the implementation of a system that identified toxic replies and reduced their visibility by putting them behind an extra click, similar to what X does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky also saw a drop in user reports month-over-month, with reports per 1,000 monthly active users declining 50.9% from January to December.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png\" alt=\"a graph showing the number of reports, with most of the reports filed in the month of January 2025 featuring mostly violence, harassment, and other categories.\" class=\"wp-image-3088248\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png 1313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=1200,720 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=1280,768 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=720,432 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=900,540 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=800,480 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=668,401 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=625,375 625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=1028,617 1028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=708,425 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of moderation, Bluesky noted it removed 3,619 accounts for suspected influence operations, most likely those operating from Russia. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-increases-in-takedowns-legal-requests\">Increases in takedowns, legal requests</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said last fall it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/bluesky-says-its-getting-more-aggressive-about-moderation-and-enforcement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">getting more aggressive</a> about its moderation and enforcement, and that appears to be true.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Bluesky took down 2.44 million items in 2025, including accounts and content.

Most of the permanent suspensions were focused on accounts engaging in inauthentic behavior, spam networks, and impersonation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, its report suggests that it prefers labeling content more than it does booting out users. Last year, Bluesky applied 16.49 million labels to content, up 200% year-over-year, while account takedown grew 104% from 1.02 million to 2.08 million. Most of the labeling involved adult and suggestive content or nudity.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We can’t shrink away and hope the crisis fades. Hope without action is not a strategy ––  it’s an invitation for Trump to trample whatever he can see, including our own business and security interests.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s been some pushback among the most powerful in the Valley against these deaths. Besides Hoffman, a longtime critic of Trump, billionaire <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/vinod-khosla-publicly-disavows-keith-rabois-comments-on-ice-shooting/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">VC Vinod Khosla has been the most vocal</a>, characterizing the White House and crew as “a conscious-less administration.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have also expressed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/anthropic-and-openai-ceos-condemn-ice-violence-praise-trump/\">concern over the Border Patrol incidents</a>, with some doing so in leaked internal memos. But most of them were quick to distance their concerns over this issue from the president himself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the distinction that Hoffman wants to end. He’s making the case that tech leaders have power “and sitting on that power is not good for business. It’s also not neutrality. It’s a choice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, many of the largest tech companies depend on the federal government for business, including AI regulation, tariffs that affect the costs of their products, and massive, lucrative contracts to supply the U.S. government with technology. (OpenAI even got in a bit of hot water in November after its CFO said, and later walked back, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/06/sam-altman-says-he-doesnt-want-the-government-to-bail-out-openai-if-it-fails/\">that the company wanted the feds to backstop their loans</a>, essentially guaranteeing payment so the AI lab could get more favorable rates.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hoffman is echoing the sentiment of a growing contingent of tech workers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\">who have signed a petition</a> asking their CEOs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities, to cancel <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/\">all company contracts with ICE</a>, and to speak out publicly against ICE’s violence.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there certainly are tech leaders who remain vocal supporters of Trump, like Elon Musk and Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures, many leaders appear to be, at least publicly, walking the fence. Cook, for instance, wrote that he was “heartbroken” and urged “de-escalation” in his internal memo, but also <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2026/01/27/apple-tim-cook-trump-alex-pretti/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">attended</a> an exclusive screening of First Lady Melania Trump’s documentary hours after the ICE shooting of Alex Pretti, one of the Americans killed in the incidents. Hence Hoffman’s call to arms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to the report, the hackers didn’t face a lot of resistance. The targeted systems used default usernames and passwords and did not have multi-factor authentication enabled, both incredibly basic mistakes. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers tried to infect the systems they broke into with wiper malware designed to erase and effectively destroy the systems, perhaps trying to turn off the power, although it’s unclear if that was their goal. Either way, the attacks were stopped at the heat-and-power plant, but not at the wind and solar farms, whose systems to monitor and control grid systems were made inoperable by the malware. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of the attacks were purely destructive in nature — by analogy to the physical world, they can be compared to deliberate acts of arson,” read the report. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers failed to disrupt power at any of their targeted facilities. And even if they had succeeded, the report said that the hack “would not have affected the stability of the Polish power system during the period in question.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cybersecurity firms <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-research-sandworm-cyberattack-poland-power-grid-late-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ESET</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dragos.com/blog/poland-power-grid-attack-electrum-targets-distributed-energy-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dragos</a> previously released reports about the attacks, which occurred on December 29 of last year, accusing the notorious Russian government hacking group Sandworm of being behind the intrusions. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sandworm</a> has a documented history of targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine and turning off the lights in the country in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cybersecurity-sandworm-idUSKBN0UM00N20160108/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2015</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2016</a>, and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/sandworm-disrupts-power-ukraine-operational-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2022</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poland’s CERT, however, accused a different Russian government hacking group, known as <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Berserk Bear or Dragonfly</a>, which is not known for destructive attacks, but rather more traditional cyberespionage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

As one of the year’s first major tech IPOs, the insurtech platform is being closely watched as a bellwether for the 2026 listing cycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company and its selling shareholders raised approximately $200 million in the offering, selling 10.5 million shares at $19 each under the ticker symbol “LIFE” — one of the more on-the-nose choices in recent memory. The name fits. Ethos runs a three-sided platform where consumers buy policies online in 10 minutes without medical exams. It says over 10,000 independent agents use its software to sell those policies and that carriers like Legal &amp; General America and John Hancock rely on it for underwriting and administrative services. Ethos itself isn’t an insurer — it’s a licensed agency earning commissions on sales.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the company’s stock closed its first day as a public company at $16.85, 11% below its IPO price of $19, Ethos co-founders Peter Colis and Lingke Wang still have plenty to celebrate, having grown the 10-year-old business to public-market scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we launched [the business], there were like eight or nine other life insurtech startups that looked very similar to Ethos, with similar Series A funding,” Colis told TechCrunch. “Over time, the vast majority of those startups have pivoted, been acquired at subscale, remain at subscale or gone out of business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Policygenius, which raised over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/02/insurtech-policygenius-cuts-25-of-staff-less-than-3-months-after-raising-125m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$250 million</a> from investors, including KKR and Norwest Venture Partners, was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/digital-insurance-market-policygenius-be-acquired-by-eldridges-zinnia-2023-04-25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquired by PE-backed Zinnia</a> in 2023. Meanwhile, Health IQ, a startup that secured more than $200 million from prominent VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2023/09/11/andreessen-horowitz-backed-startup-health-iq-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed for bankruptcy</a> that same year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ethos, which has raised over $400 million in venture capital, could have easily succumbed to a similar fate. Instead, the company remained laser-focused on reaching profitability as the era of cheap capital and easy fundraising came to an end in 2022. “Not knowing what the ongoing funding climate would be, we got really serious about ensuring profitability,” Colis said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That financial discipline transformed it into a profitable company by mid-2023, according to its <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1788451/000119312525219975/d901135ds1.htm#rom901135_13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IPO documents</a>. Since then, Ethos has also maintained a year-over-year revenue growth rate of more than 50%. In the nine months ending September 30, 2025, the company generated almost $278 million in revenue and just under $46.6 million in net income.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the company ended its first day as a public company with a market capitalization of about $1.1 billion, a valuation that’s significantly below the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/ethos-picks-up-100m-at-a-2-7b-valuation-for-a-big-data-platform-to-improve-life-insurance-accessibility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$2.7 billion</a> it garnered in its last private round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 in July 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why Ethos went public, Colis said that a big part of the reason was to bring “additional trust and credibility” to potential partners and clients. He explained that because many major insurance carriers are over a century old, being publicly traded signals the company’s staying power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The largest outside shareholders of Ethos include prominent firms, including Sequoia, Accel, Google’s venture arm GV, and SoftBank, as well as General Catalyst and Heroic Ventures. Sequoia and Accel did not sell shares in the IPO, the company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1788451/000119312526015943/d901135ds1a.htm#rom901135_18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disclosed</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company reports that its signature device had its best quarter ever, thanks partially to a surge of sales in regions like China and India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“iPhone had its best-ever quarter driven by unprecedented demand, with all-time records across every geographic segment,” said CEO Tim Cook during the company’s earnings call Thursday. Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/fy2026-q1/FY26_Q1_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earnings report</a> shows the company sold $85 billion worth of iPhones during its first quarter, up from $69 billion in the same period last year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the call’s Q&amp;A portion, Cook revealed that China had seen a huge surge in sales. “It was driven by iPhone, where we set an all-time revenue record,” Cook said, noting that it was the “best iPhone quarter in history in Greater China.” Cook said the sales bump had been driven by enthusiasm for the iPhone 17, which was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/iphone-17-iphone-air-airpods-pro-3-and-everything-else-announced-at-apples-hardware-event/\">announced in September</a>. The new model has proven to be <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/01/iphone-17-pro-demand-surges-far-past-iphone-16-pro-launch-orders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">significantly more popular</a> than the company’s previous iPhone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s earnings report shows that its overall sales in the Greater China region jumped from $18.5 billion in the year-ago quarter to $25.5 billion. Cook noted that, overall, the company had fared quite well in the region. “I would tell you that during the quarter, traffic in our stores in China grew by strong double digits year over year,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cook also highlighted India as another region where iPhones — as well as other products — seemed to be flying off the shelves. “We did set a quarterly revenue record during the December quarter,” Cook said, noting that records had been set for “iPhone and Mac and iPad [sales] and an all-time revenue record on services.” Cook called it “a terrific quarter” in a country that he noted is “the second largest smartphone market in the world and the fourth largest PC market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone aside, Apple’s overall sales jumped across every geographical region, its earnings report shows. In the Americas, for instance, sales went from $52.6 billion a year ago to $58.5 billion, while in Europe, they increased from $33.8 billion to $38.1 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As analysts peppered CEO Tim Cook with softball questions during Apple’s earnings call, one analyst dared to ask the question that seemingly no one in Silicon Valley is willing to ask.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I think about your AI initiatives, you know, it’s clear there are added costs associated with that… Many of your competitors have already integrated AI into their devices, and it’s just not clear yet what incremental monetization they’re seeing because of AI…,” started Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Could there be a tinge of nervousness underneath this Finance Man’s probably-very-financey facade? In what I can only imagine must have been a Herculean display of courage, Woodring asked the question that lurks only in the darkest, dampest recesses of investors’ minds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So, how do you monetize AI?” he asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You’d think this would come up more. You would be wrong. Instead, Big Tech has taken a largely vibes-driven approach to AI development. Take OpenAI, for instance, which may seem like it’s on top of the world, given how ChatGPT has embedded itself into the cultural consciousness. But the company <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-won-t-money-2030-182441351.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">isn’t planning to make any money</a> until 2030. Analysts from HBSC are even doubtful about that timeline, especially since it will need another $207 billion in funding, estimates say. Ask anyone in tech how OpenAI is planning to break even, and you’ll be met with the verbal equivalent of the ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ emoticon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But good ol’ Tim “$143.8 billion in revenue” Cook was having a good afternoon, so maybe he’d finally spill the beans about how any of these companies are planning to recoup their investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His answer was disappointing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Well, let me just say that we’re bringing intelligence to more of what people love, and we’re integrating it across the operating system in a personal and private way, and I think that by doing so, it creates great value, and that opens up a range of opportunities across our products and services,” Cook said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, there you have it, folks. Apple will monetize AI by creating “great value.” And, crucially, that will “open up a range of opportunities.” Which we will experience in “products and services.” Cool!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, shout-out to that Morgan Stanley guy for trying.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While the talks appear to be in the early stage, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, it could eventually lead to at least one company folding into SpaceX. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two scenarios are being hashed out. In one, SpaceX and Tesla would merge, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/elon-musk-s-spacex-is-said-to-consider-merger-with-tesla-or-xai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per Bloomberg</a>, citing unnamed insiders. In another, SpaceX and aXI (which already owns Musk’s social media platform X) would combine.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/musks-spacex-merger-talks-with-xai-ahead-planned-ipo-source-says-2026-01-29/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting by Reuters</a>, a merger between SpaceX and xAI could take place ahead of a planned SpaceX IPO this year. This would bring products like the Grok chatbot, X platform, Starlink satellites, and SpaceX rockets together under one corporation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Company representatives from SpaceX and xAI have not discussed this possibility in public. However, recent filings show that two new corporate entities were established in Nevada on January 21, which are called K2 Merger Sub Inc. and K2 Merger Sub 2 LLC. This suggests that Musk is keeping all options open.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are upsides to either scenario. Combining the SpaceX and xAI companies could allow xAI to put its data centers in space, something Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/elon-musk-says-teslas-restarted-dojo3-will-be-for-space-based-ai-compute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has said he wants</a>. A SpaceX-Tesla tie-up could align the EV maker’s energy storage business with the data center in space idea as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And both options — as well as a combination of all three companies — fall in line with Musk’s comments and recent actions to consolidate, or at the very least share resources between them. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, according to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/spacex-to-invest-2-billion-into-elon-musks-xai-413934de?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfJGajOyX0Jq6Oe7VY0pK_28EASB6Z_rVltqiEVHf09KirGkrAZ_vM4QJ2Y2Wg%3D&amp;gaa_ts=697bb6fc&amp;gaa_sig=jPWtwCwRQSOTId470Pop-Ss6xvPoSE8nKjZBP9e90_NelhVjLVNVL-Gb750oF1cEMhyx1EPYIM3SW7d621zGEg%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, and earlier this week, Tesla (also led by Musk) revealed it, too, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-invested-2b-in-elon-musks-xai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invested $2 billion</a> in the AI startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, xAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bought X</a> in a deal that Musk said valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion.

So that it can allow its employees to take the day off to protest, Stubblebine said Medium will coordinate with the necessary teams to ensure there’s a plan for “business continuity” on Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech leaders, including Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">outspoken in protest of ICE</a>. Still, many large tech companies and executives have spent the last several weeks <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/big-tech-leaders-spend-record-109-million-to-win-over-deal-minded-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">courting favor</a> with the Trump administration. Some execs — including <a href=\"https://spyglass.org/tim-cook-captured/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apple CEO Tim Cook</a> — were criticized for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/business/alex-pretti-melania-trump-corporate-ceos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">attending the screening</a> of the Amazon MGM Studios-produced “Melania” documentary on the day federal border control agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many rank-and-file tech employees, meanwhile, have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\">demanded that ICE and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) get out of U.S. cities</a>, as evidenced <a href=\"https://iceout.tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">by the open letter signed by</a> more than 500 tech industry employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stubblebine seems to share that opinion, writing that Medium has a responsibility to “make its stance clear,” especially “as many other tech orgs are donating to the Trump campaign.” He also said that Medium’s product exists to help “elevate truth and diverse voices,” not hateful content or racism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His message also reiterated Medium’s support for DEI, the set of pro-diversity policies the Trump administration has attempted to dismantle through executive orders, the elimination of DEI positions in the federal workforce, curriculum removals, legal targeting, and more.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our business thrives when the country thrives, and so being out there representing is good for [our] mission,” Stubblebine said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
