FreeForm declined to disclose the company’s post-financing valuation, which Pitchbook cites as $179 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO and cofounder Erik Palitsch said the funding would allow the company to upgrade its current GoldenEye printing system, which uses 18 lasers to fuse metal powders into precision components, to a new version. Dubbed Skyfall, the next iteration of the platform would use hundreds of lasers to produce thousands of kilograms of metal parts each day. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the culmination of a vision Palitsch and co-founder/president Thomas Ronacher launched in 2018. The two met while developing rocket engines at SpaceX, where they found that industrial machines for printing metal components are expensive, finicky, and not well designed for mass manufacturing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their new company would build its platform from the ground up to achieve higher throughput and flexibility, with an emphasis on active software controls. Palitsch says Freeform’s platform is “AI native,” noting a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/ex-spacex-engineers-land-14m-to-scale-new-method-for-3d-printing-metal/\">partnership with Nvidia</a> that allows the company to access advanced GPUs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we’re the only quote-unquote manufacturing company out there that has H200 clusters in a data center on site,” Paltisch told TechCrunch. “What are they doing? We’re running real-time physics-based simulations and learning all the different aspects of the end to end manufacturing workflow.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The data collected by sensors in the company’s manufacturing platform and during the simulations allows Freeform to rapidly improve production quality and quantity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have more meaningful data on the physics of the metal-printing process than any company in the world,” head of talent Cameron Kay said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Palitsch said he could not disclose any customers, he said the company is already delivering hundreds of “mission-critical” parts to buyers. Now, the company wants to hire as many as 100 new employees and expand its facility to start executing on its contract backlog. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Manufacturing-as-a-service has grown as a category as venture investors have taken a greater interest in building vehicles, robots, and energy production systems.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the most consequential decisions early-stage founders have to make is who they will bring on as their founding team. The first five to 10 employees will have a massive impact on the company culture, and the precedents set with them are difficult to change down the road. That’s why this season on Build Mode, we’re diving into what it takes to build a world-class founding team.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To kick off season two, Isabelle Johannessen is joined by Yuri Sagalov, managing director at General Catalyst and former founder, YC partner, and seed investor at Wayfinder Ventures. Sagalov has worked with hundreds of pre-seed and seed-stage companies and has seen firsthand the best (and worst) ways to hire in the early days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this episode, Sagalov offers his best pieces of advice for founders who are hiring their first team, strategically building their cap table, and forming compensation structures that can scale with the company.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-three-types-of-investors-and-which-one-to-avoid\">The three types of investors (and which one to avoid) </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagalov categorizes investors into three main buckets: the ones that are heavily involved and function as an extension of your team, the ones that will give you a check and then vanish, and the micromanagers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first type of investor is the most valuable according to Sagalov: “They’re going to help you with recruiting, hiring, go to market. And the most interesting thing with those investors is often it’s completely disconnected from the check size.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it may feel counterintuitive to turn down investments, working with VCs who will become overly involved in the process may cause more harm than good in the long run. Sagalov said, “The only bucket that I avoid is this third bucket of investors who give you money and they’re kind of in your kitchen, meddling. They have an opinion on everything. They get stressed out when things don’t go right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a fundraise, everyone is putting their best foot forward, so Sagalov suggests reaching out to current portfolio companies before committing to an investor.  “The best thing you can do as a founder is actually talk to portfolio companies, talk to other founders that they’ve worked with, ask for concrete examples of how they’ve been helpful, if they’ve been helpful, and then actually ask how they were when things didn’t go right.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-split-equity-with-a-co-founder\">How to split equity with a co-founder </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an investor, Sagalov looks for co-founders who have created an equity split that is fair but also hedges for future misalignments. He suggests creating a slight differentiation by plus or minus one share so there is a clear way to break deadlocks.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagalov also reminds early-stage founders that these early decisions have staying power: “Oftentimes founders over-index on ‘I came up with the idea, so I deserve the lion’s share.’  Most of the journey of the company is ahead of them. You don’t want someone waking up five years from now feeling like they put in equal blood, sweat, and tears but own one-fifth of the equity.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talk-to-early-employees-about-risk-and-compensation\">Talk to early employees about risk and compensation </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first few hires should be all in on the startup’s mission. Oftentimes, joining an early-stage startup can be perceived as risky. Sagalov emphasized the importance of discussing the risks and potential benefits: “Fundamentally, what you’re looking for when you’re hiring the first few people are missionaries who, beyond even the compensation, want to join you for the mission of the business,” he said. “You want to be honest with them that there is a lot of risk on the journey.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next week on Build Mode, we’re talking with Sarah Lucena, the founder and CEO of Mappa, who discusses how founders can take compatibility into account and hire the right fit for the team the first time, using their AI tool. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Isabelle Johannessen is our host. Build Mode is produced and edited by Maggie Nye. Audience Development is led by Morgan Little.

Earlier this week, Adani Group outlined plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/adani-pledges-100b-for-ai-data-centers-as-india-seeks-bigger-role-in-global-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invest about $100 billion to build AI data centers</a> in the country, and the Indian government <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/india-bids-to-attract-over-200b-in-ai-infrastructure-investment-by-2028/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expects more than $200 billion</a> in AI infrastructure spending over the next two years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global technology firms are also stepping up their presence, with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-taps-tata-for-100mw-ai-data-center-capacity-in-india-eyes-1gw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI partnering with the Tata Group</a> to develop about 100 megawatts of AI capacity in the country, and plans to scale that to 1 gigawatt eventually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ambani said the push is essential for India’s technological self-reliance, saying the country “cannot afford to rent intelligence,” and that Reliance aims to cut the cost of AI services as dramatically as it once reduced mobile data prices in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The biggest constraint in AI today is not talent or imagination,” Ambani said. “It is scarcity and high cost of compute.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The build-out, Ambani said, would be supported by Reliance’s green energy capacity, which stretches to 10 gigawatts of surplus power from solar projects in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reliance will partner with Indian enterprises, startups, and academic institutions to embed AI in industries ranging from manufacturing and logistics to agriculture, healthcare and financial services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jio has already been striking AI partnerships: it last year landed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/google-partners-with-ambanis-reliance-to-offer-free-ai-pro-access-to-millions-of-jio-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deal with Google</a> to offer free Gemini AI Pro access to millions of its users in India.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reliance also plans to develop AI capabilities in several Indian languages to spur adoption of the tech, Ambani said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The aggressive push highlights how India’s largest conglomerates are racing to secure a foothold in what is expected to be one of the country’s biggest technology opportunities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company’s enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/openai-for-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/openais-stargate-project-sets-its-sights-on-international-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stargate project</a>, which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services’ HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata’s workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI’s tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company’s expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users</a> spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI’s most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI’s access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI’s long-term ambitions in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata’s businesses. The conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. TCS also intends to use OpenAI’s Codex tools to standardize AI-native software development across its engineering teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said OpenAI’s partnership would help build “state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India” while supporting efforts to skill the country’s workforce for the AI era.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, including whether OpenAI is making a capital investment in HyperVault or leasing capacity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November 2025, TCS <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/indias-tcs-gets-tpg-to-fund-half-of-2b-ai-data-center-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">secured backing from private equity firm TPG</a> to develop AI-ready infrastructure in India under its HyperVault data center business. The platform is backed by about ₹180 billion (about $2 billion) in planned investment and is designed to support large-scale compute workloads for hyperscalers and enterprise customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI will also expand its certification programs in India, with TCS becoming the first participating organization outside the United States. The certifications are designed to help professionals build practical AI skills across roles and industries, the company said. The move follows OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-pushes-into-higher-education-as-india-seeks-to-scale-ai-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent partnerships with leading Indian institutions</a> in engineering, medicine, and design.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI plans to open new offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">existing presence in New Delhi</a> as it deepens operations in the country.

Earlier this week, OpenAI partnered with leading Indian engineering, medical, and design institutions to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-pushes-into-higher-education-as-india-seeks-to-scale-ai-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bring AI tools into higher education</a>, betting that India’s large developer base and more than a billion internet users will play a central role in the next phase of AI adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pine Labs is already using AI internally to automate parts of its settlement and reconciliation process, cutting the time it takes to clear daily settlements from hours to minutes, according to Chief executive B Amrish Rau. The Noida-based company previously relied on manual checks by dozens of employees to process funds from multiple banks before markets opened each day, a workflow that is now largely handled by AI-driven systems, he said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Pine Labs, the partnership is intended to extend those AI-driven efficiencies beyond internal operations to merchants and corporate clients, starting with business-to-business use cases such as invoice processing, settlements and payments orchestration, Rau told TechCrunch. He noted the company sees faster adoption in B2B workflows, where AI agents can handle large volumes of repetitive financial tasks under predefined rules, before similar capabilities reach consumer-facing payments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People talk about retail AI, but the bigger impact of all of this is really efficiency improvement, especially in B2B,” Rau said. “If you look at invoicing and settlement, those are workflows where agents can actually drive the process end to end, and that’s where adoption can happen faster.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rollout of more autonomous, agent-led payment workflows will move faster in overseas markets where regulations already allow such transactions, Rau said, while India is likely to see a more gradual adoption focused on AI-assisted commerce rather than fully agent-initiated payments. He said that Pine Labs is already prototyping agent-driven payments in parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, even as Indian regulations require tighter controls on how payments are authorized.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For OpenAI, the partnership offers a route deeper into India’s payments and enterprise ecosystem as it looks to move beyond consumer-facing tools and embed its models into high-volume, regulated workflows. Rau said the collaboration is aimed at increasing merchant stickiness and expanding Pine Labs’ role from a payments processor to a broader commerce platform, with higher transaction volumes over time translating into incremental revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pine Labs says it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/pine-labs-aims-to-take-indian-fintech-global-even-as-it-cuts-valuation-for-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">works with more than 980,000 merchants</a>, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, and has processed over 6 billion cumulative transactions valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (about $126 billion), per its prospectus published last year. The fintech operates across 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, parts of Africa, the UAE, and the U.S., giving the OpenAI partnership reach across both Indian and international markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rau said the partnership does not involve revenue sharing between the two companies, with Pine Labs not taking a cut if its merchants choose to embed OpenAI’s tools. “We’ve kept it completely independent of each other — anything related to payment and payment services, we will get the benefit of it, and anything related to OpenAI revenues will go to them,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The arrangement, Rau added, is also non-exclusive. He compared it to OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe in the U.S. and said Pine Labs remains open to working with other AI providers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rau said Pine Labs is building additional security and compliance layers around AI-driven workflows to ensure that sensitive merchant and consumer transaction data remains protected, as the company integrates AI more deeply into its payments systems. He said the focus is on ensuring transactions remain secure and compliant even as more workflows are automated by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pine Labs’ interest in AI-driven commerce builds on earlier work through its Setu unit, which has <a href=\"https://www.pinelabs.com/media-analyst/setu-launches-indias-first-agentic-bill-payments-experience-on-chatgpt-and-claude\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">experimented with agent-led bill payment experiences</a> using chatbots including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude.

class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Germ’s standalone app is also available in a public beta on iOS in North America and Europe. That app had seen thousands of downloads so far, but after the official integration announcement, daily active users jumped by 5x, the team said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">California-based Germ is a startup founded by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tessa-r-brown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tessa Brown</a>, a communications scholar who previously taught at Stanford, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmxue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mark Xue</a>, who worked as a privacy engineer at Apple on technologies like FaceTime and iMessage. The idea, the company previously explained to TechCrunch, was to offer an alternative to other E2E encrypted platforms like iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp that’s built on newer technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Germ takes advantage of Messaging Layer Security (MLS), a new standard approved by the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF), and the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol</a> (or ATProto), which powers Bluesky, Skylight, and a growing number of other social apps. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of requiring a user’s phone number, Germ integrates with ATProto to enable its encrypted chats. That means Germ’s messages cannot be decrypted by another service, including itself or Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the new messenger, you’ll simply click on the badge on a friend’s profile on Bluesky, which opens an iOS App Clip — a lightweight, temporary app. You click “open” on this app experience and then authenticate by logging in with your ATProto handle. You can then send a message to a friend immediately. You’ll also be nudged to download the full Germ DM app, but this is optional. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you want to add the badge to your own profile, you’ll download the Germ DM app on iOS and authenticate your Bluesky credentials there. (Note: We had to force-quit the Bluesky iOS app and restart it before the Germ badge appeared.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?w=315\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094104\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png 408w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=199,430 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=334,720 334w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=371,800 371w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=310,668 310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=174,375 174w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=286,617 286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=246,531 246w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Germ Network</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been building up to the official Bluesky integration for many months, starting with a private beta in August, which was launched using “magic links” shared in users’ bios. Now, users who set up Germ to work within Bluesky will receive a new badge that’s displayed on their profiles, allowing them to remove the link-in-bio option they were using before. (The links will still work, but the badge is easier and more noticeable, of course.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Germ told TechCrunch their startup has been in conversation with the ATProto developer community, including Bluesky’s app and protocol teams, since the <a href=\"https://atprotocol.dev/atmosphereconf-seattle-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ATmosphere Conference in Seattle</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve been transparent about our planning and roadmap, and shipping our private beta in August generated valuable feedback from users and developers about the desire to replace our links in bios with native UI,” said Xue, who serves as CTO at Germ Network. “Both our team and Bluesky’s saw value in better AppView support for the Germ link.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes to Bluesky’s app were led by head of product Alex Benzer, as the company was <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/protocol-checkin-fall-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">looked to experiment</a> with implementing third-party services within Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Working directly with the Bluesky team has been a treat,” Brown, Germ’s CEO, told TechCrunch. “They ship fast, prioritize the user experience, and care about their users’ access to end-to-end encrypted messaging. We’re thrilled to be the first secure messenger they’ve brought natively into their app.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s true that the AT Protocol could eventually implement E2E encryption, that is not a focus today. As Bluesky protocol engineer Daniel Holms recently explained, the company has several reasons not to design a system itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reality is that E2EE is hard,” he <a href=\"https://dholms.leaflet.pub/3meluqcwky22a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a blog post</a>. “And this inherent complexity isn’t something that the protocol team at Bluesky can just handle – it gets pushed out to every dev trying to build a client that works with encrypted data,” Holms said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xue agreed, adding, “We align with the ATProto ethos that people should be able to communicate using the apps and tools they choose. We believe that by solving the hard problems for ATProto users in safe, transparent, and user-friendly ways, they’ll continue to choose us,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after Bluesky added support for the Germ badge, another <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/blackskyweb.xyz/post/3meoxfu7ap22m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol-based client, Blacksky</a>, did as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown noted the team is currently focused on shipping more everyday messaging features, not on monetization. But further down the road, Germ may test paid features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect that our first paid features will be centered on the needs of prosumer power users like creators, journalists, and politicians—for example, support for multiple handles and private AI-powered screening for first messages from new connections,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Specifically, it covers SeatGeek’s 15 major U.S. venue partners, including State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Nissan Stadium in Nashville, and AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington. (So, although SeatGeek is a major player in the secondary ticketing space, this integration is exclusive to venues where it operates as the primary ticketing platform.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a strategic win for SeatGeek.

At the time, the company was testing the robots at a facility in South Carolina and said it took Amazon <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/new-robots-amazon-fulfillment-agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">significantly less time to develop Blue Jay</a> — only about a year— than it did to develop its other warehouse robots, a speed the company credited to advancements in AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon spokesperson Terrence Clark told TechCrunch that Blue Jay was launched as a prototype — although that was not made clear in the company’s original press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use Blue Jay’s core technology for other robotics “manipulation programs” with employees who worked on Blue Jay being moved to other projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark told TechCrunch over email. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also unveiled the Vulcan robot last year, which is used in the storage compartments of the company’s warehouses. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/amazon-debuts-a-warehouse-robot-with-a-sense-of-touch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vulcan is a two-armed robot</a>, with one arm meant to rearrange and move items in a compartment while the other is equipped with a camera and suction cups to grab goods.

The post outlines the app’s future direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app, which is part of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the fediverse</a> — a larger, decentralized social web operating on the ActivityPub protocol — was thrust back into the spotlight when Elon Musk acquired Twitter, now called X, in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">October 2022</a>. Since then, it has seen occasional growth spurts but has often struggled to retain new users due to its more complicated setup. On Mastodon, you don’t simply create an account with a username and password; you also have to pick a server to join — an additional step that often confuses those new to decentralization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Mastodon sees somewhere between 750,000 and 1 million monthly active users, depending on the source. One <a href=\"https://mastodon.fediverse.observer/stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">third-party tracker</a> puts the figure closer to 750,000, while another estimates as many as <a href=\"https://fedidb.com/software/mastodon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1 million</a>. <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mastodon’s own site</a> says the figure is around 785,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of its coming updates, the organization says it will try to make this onboarding process more understandable, while also promoting smaller servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To date, new users have often defaulted to picking the largest servers, but that undermines the power of a decentralized web. As the blog post notes, “Mastodon is best when communities are spread across many independent servers, each with its own character and focus.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New admin tools will help indie server operators handle maintenance and moderation duties more easily, including a feature to use external blocklists. The organization will also offer ways to set up content scanning for detecting illegal content and spam, along with other tools to reduce media storage usage by serving remote media posts through a trusted third party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Mastodon will look to bring on more content creators, including public figures, journalists, and institutions, with a series of updates to its app. To do so, it’s introducing a redesigned user profile that lets individuals showcase their work as well as an enhanced compose experience. Also in the works is a new email notification option that would allow someone to follow their updates, even if they don’t yet have a Mastodon account. That could appeal to those who want to follow newsletter writers, reporters, thought leaders, and other creators, while allowing those creators to reach a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes follow the rollout of other new features in recent months, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/mastodon-rolls-out-quote-posts-with-protections-to-prevent-dunking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Quote Posts</a>, similar to the feature on X and others, but with more user controls, and plans for its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/mastodon-is-taking-cues-from-bluesky-with-plans-for-its-own-starter-packs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">own take on Starter Pack-style user recommendations</a>, called <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/featured_collections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Collections</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updates follow a shift in leadership at Mastodon: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\">founder </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eugen Rochko </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\">stepped down as CEO</a> after the platform announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/mastodon-announces-transition-to-nonprofit-structure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transition to a nonprofit structure</a> at the beginning of the year.

However, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/fei-fei-li-s-ai-startup-world-labs-in-funding-talks-at-5-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> a month ago suggested it was aiming to raise at a $5 billion valuation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership between World Labs and Autodesk will see the two companies collaborating to explore how World Labs’ models — AI systems that can generate and reason about immersive 3D environments — can work alongside Autodesk’s tools, and vice versa, starting with a focus on entertainment use cases. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For World Labs, Autodesk’s investment is a signal that its product has commercial appeal. The startup’s first world model product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Marble</a>, released last November, lets users create editable, downloadable 3D environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk is one of the biggest developers of 3D CAD (computer-aided design) software. Its platform underpins architectural, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and entertainment workflows. That focus on the built world makes investment in advanced spatial AI a natural extension of its core business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or as Li put it in a statement: “Autodesk has long helped people think spatially and solve real-world problems and, together, we share a clear purpose: building physical AI that augments human creativity and puts more powerful tools in the hands of designers, builders, and creators.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, Autodesk will serve as an adviser to World Labs, and the two will collaborate at the “research and model level.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daron Green, Autodesk’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch the partnership is still in its early days, so the precise form it’s going to take hasn’t been determined yet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You could anticipate us consuming their models or them consuming our models in different settings,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He mused that customers might like to start with a world-model-based sketch in World Labs (say, of an office layout) and then drill down on certain design aspects (like the design of the desk), which is where Autodesk’s tech might come in. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Similarly, you might want to take an object that you’ve designed in our [platform], and put it in a context that you create through one of [World Labs’] prompts,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green added that data sharing is not part of the agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green said the two companies plan to start with media and entertainment use cases. Most companies building world models — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/i-built-marshmallow-castles-in-googles-new-ai-world-generator-project-genie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google DeepMind</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/\">Runway</a> — see gaming and interactive entertainment as an initial go-to-market strategy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk already works with most major media production companies and has been training models for character animation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are close to world models,” Green said. “They’re a characterization of an animal in the world that’s responding to physical constraints like time, maybe a terrain it needs to traverse. So there’s a physical understanding in the model, and you can see how that might be combined [with World Labs’ tech]. You’re not just animating the dog, but you’re giving it a world within which it can now interact.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership with World Labs supports Autodesk’s broader push to integrate more AI features across its software portfolio. The company is developing <a href=\"https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/news/upcoming-3d-generative-ai-foundation-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“neural CAD,”</a> a new kind of generative AI model trained on geometric data that can reason about components and entire systems. Put simply, it can generate working 3D models, not just images, with an understanding of how those designs would function in the real world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk’s neural CAD models are already being integrated into the firm’s product design and architecture products as a step toward more advanced spatial intelligence. But World Labs’ models could help extend that capability beyond individual design files toward more holistic digital representations of the physical world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green thinks different AI systems, including large language models, world models, and neural CAD will be combined in the future to improve designs for Autodesk’s customers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If AI is to be truly useful, it must understand worlds, not just words,” Li said in the statement. “Worlds are governed by geometry, physics, and dynamics, and reconciling the semantic, spatial, and physical is the next great frontier of AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to include more details on World Labs’ raise.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature also lets users switch between the different formats across devices. While in the “Read &amp; Listen” mode, the text of the book is highlighted in real time in sync with the narration.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Kindle app <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/narrationhelp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">already offered a tool </a>that would allow readers to move between the Audible version and the e-book, when both versions had been purchased. This feature is now coming to Audible’s app for the first time. Customers will need to own both versions of the book for this to work, but discounted audiobooks will be made available to customers who own the matching e-book, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, hundreds of thousands of titles will be supported by the new “Read &amp; Listen” feature, including those in English, German, Spanish, Italian, and French. Initially, the option will be offered in the U.S., with the U.K., Australia, and Germany gaining support over the next few months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To discover eligible titles, Audible will automatically identify which Kindle e-books have audiobook matches within its app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, many customers were already reading and listening to their books without buying two versions — by having Alexa narrate their e-books from their Kindle library. Alexa is not a professional narrator by any means, and the AI assistant’s more monotonous delivery can lead you to zone out. By offering a way to add on the audiobook for a lower price when you’ve already bought the e-book, Amazon hopes to boost book sales across formats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also claims that the combination of reading and listening can improve focus and comprehension, according to industry research and its own internal data. In addition, customers who read and listen are the most engaged, consuming nearly twice as much content per month as audiobook-only customers, Audible noted. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature may make sense for students and those learning a new language, as well as those who are trying to get through more books quickly. It’s also useful for those who regularly switch back and forth between reading and listening, and those who want the experience of the narration — particularly if a book is read by a favorite voice actor. Plus, some may simply appreciate having a narrator introduce all the characters by name, so they can learn the pronunciation without having to guess (a particularly thorny issue in fantasy novels!).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Audiobooks count as reading,” said Andy Tsao, chief product officer at Audible, in a statement about the launch. “But now at Audible, you can read with your eyes too. Read &amp; Listen gives book lovers the best of both worlds. Whether you’re learning a new language, studying for school, or lost in a story’s world, you no longer have to choose one format over the other.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon notes that the new feature will not impact publishers’ royalty payments. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Once in full-screen mode, viewers can swipe up to scroll to the next video, which is reminiscent of TikTok’s popular format.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the new player aims to enhance mobile video viewing, some users argue that the update forces all videos into a cropped, full-screen view, removing the option to view content in its original aspect ratio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This UI sucks so bad. Let me just watch full-scale videos,” <a href=\"https://x.com/leonardozerega/status/2023546551055118764?s=46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one user said</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When another user <a href=\"https://x.com/samuelbeek/status/2023543867145154787?s=46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asked</a> which orientation is preferred, Bier confirmed that portrait is ideal. This approach mirrors broader industry trends, with vertical videos dominating platforms such as TikTok and Instagram Reels. Even streaming services have adopted the format, with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/disney-is-launching-short-form-videos-this-year/\">Disney+ </a>being the most recent to introduce a vertical video feed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Sorry, but cropping the video incentivized people to post square videos. We are a mobile company,” he said, noting that X will stop cropping vertical content moving forward. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bier hinted that more video-focused updates are on the horizon as X doubles down on its video ambitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of X’s update is notable, given that last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/heres-whats-you-should-know-about-the-us-tiktok-deal/\">TikTok’s U.S. operations</a> were sold to an American investor group. X is positioning itself as a competitor, ramping up its video features to attract both viewers and creators. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recent introduction of the video player follows X’s launch of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/x-expands-its-vertical-video-feed-to-global-users/\">dedicated vertical video feed </a>that became available globally last year. The company is also incorporating AI-driven tools, such as Grok’s text-to-video generation feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Grok’s image-generation capability recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/x-restricts-groks-image-generation-to-paying-subscribers-only-after-drawing-the-worlds-ire/\">sparked controversy</a>, leading to its restriction to paying subscribers on X, due to the tool allowing users to create sexualized and nude images of women and children.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Annualized revenue refers to a business’s current revenue rate projected over a full year. The social media giant says the milestone is driven by its Snapchat+ offering, which has now surpassed 25 million subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in 2022, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month/\">Snapchat+</a> gives subscribers access to exclusive and pre-release features for $3.99 per month. Following a successful launch, Snap introduced additional paid tiers beyond the core Snapchat+ subscription over the past year to further diversify its revenue streams.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Snapchat+ has become one of the fastest-growing consumer subscription services globally, with subscriber growth every quarter,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/snap-1b-direct-revenue-25m-subscription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “What started as an early-access program for our most engaged Snapchatters has quickly scaled into a meaningful business—one that now represents a strong and growing revenue stream alongside our ads business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last June, Snapchat launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/snapchat-rolls-out-a-new-8-99-lens-subscription-tier/\">Lens+</a>, which gives users access to exclusive Lenses and AR experiences, along with the perks in the standard Snapchat+ tier, for $8.99 per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early 2025, the company launched an ad-free Snapchat+ subscription tier called Platinum for $15.99 per month. And, in a controversial move in September, Snapchat announced plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/snapchat-caps-free-memory-storage-launches-paid-storage-plans/\">cap free storage for its Memories feature</a> and launched a paid storage plan that costs $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ subscribers will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moving beyond Snapchat+, the company announced yesterday that it’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/snapchat-launches-creator-subscription-in-the-u-s/\">launching creator subscriptions</a> in alpha with select people in the U.S. Users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscriptions, which will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator’s public Stories, and an ad-free experience for that creator’s Stories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of the future, Snap says it’s going to continue to grow Snapchat+ with a focus on customization and community-driven features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/meta-to-test-premium-subscriptions-on-instagram-facebook-and-whatsapp/\">rival Meta is following suit</a>, as the company told TechCrunch last month that it was going to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, you could ask Gemini to create a “comical R&amp;B slow jam about a sock finding its match,” and the app will generate a 30-second track along with cover art made by Nano Banana.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said that you can even upload a photo or a video, and the AI-powered tool will create a song to match the mood of the media file.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that Lyria 3 improves on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3009803/google-expands-access-to-its-lyria-music-generating-models/\">the previous generation of models</a>, creating more realistic and complex music tracks. Users can also change and control other elements like style, vocals, and tempo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with rolling out Lyria 3 to the Gemini app, Google is making the model available to YouTube creators through the Dream Track feature on YouTube, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14151606?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a tool</a> that helps creators make AI-generated tracks. The option was only available to YouTube creators in the U.S. until now. But with this release, Google is expanding Dream Track availability globally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said that you can’t mimic an artist outright, but if you add an artist’s name to your prompt, Gemini will create a track in a similar style or a mood. (It’s not clear if generation will make it easier for others to decode the music style of a particular artist.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Music generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content,” the company said in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/lyria-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google noted that all songs created with the Lyria 3 model will have a SynthID watermark to identify AI-generated content. The company said that it’s also <a href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16722517?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">adding capabilities to identify AI-generated music</a> with SynthID within Gemini. Users will be able to upload tracks and ask Gemini if it is AI-generated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Music generation is rolling out to all 18+ Gemini users across the world with support for English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-generated music has created mixed sentiments among artists and listeners. On one hand, companies like YouTube and Spotify are adopting AI and signing contracts with music labels to monetize AI-generated music. On the other hand, AI model and tooling companies are facing lawsuits from the music industry over copyrights of the training material. Platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/deezer-makes-it-easier-for-rival-platforms-to-take-a-stance-against-ai-generated-music/\">Deezer have published tools to mark AI-generated music</a> to curb fraudulent streams of this kind of music.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marketing is one of the few operations no industry can afford to ignore, which is why we have a veritable host of AI-powered marketing tools being shoved into marketers’ faces today. All the social platforms, from Facebook and Instagram to TikTok, and major incumbents like Microsoft and Google, to content-generation startups like Jasper and Copy.ai, offer AI tools that claim to make marketers’ lives easier in uncountable ways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That was partly why I was confused to see yet another marketing AI startup entering the fray: San Francisco-based Kana just came out of stealth with a suite of AI agents that can do data analysis, audience targeting, campaign management, customer engagement, media planning, and optimizing for AI chatbots. The startup has raised $15 million in a seed funding round led by Mayfield. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Kana has something going for it that most marketing startups today don’t: Its co-founders, Tom Chavez (CEO; pictured above on the right) and Vivek Vaidya (CTO; pictured above on the left), have been building marketing tech for more than 25 years. Kana’s actually their fourth venture after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2008/03/14/microsoft-picks-up-another-ad-startup-rapt/\">Rapt</a> (acquired by Microsoft in 2008), <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/to-beef-up-in-marketing-tech-salesforce-is-buying-krux-for-340m-in-cash-and-stock-potentially-750m-overall/\">Krux</a> (bought by Salesforce in 2016), and startup studio <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/28/superset-startup-studio-fundraise/\">super{set}</a>, which they incubated Kana in for nine months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling this a “wondrous” time to be building, Chavez said there was a clear opportunity to bring their experience and today’s AI tech to bear on this class of problems. “We see a market that’s crying out for solutions that meet this moment […] We understand the space deeply, having wallowed in it arguably a little too long; having really stood in our customers’ pain,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The solution, as Kana pitches it, involves “loosely coupled” AI agents that can be tailored “on the fly,” integrated into legacy marketing software, and can simultaneously work on different operations. So a marketer could, for example, upload a media brief that Kana’s agents would analyze to figure out the campaign goals, search for the audience to target, and pull in data from inventory and market research to further tweak the plan. The platform bakes in autonomous campaign tracking, optimization, and reporting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside agents, Kana offers synthetic data generation to augment third-party data sources for activities like market research and audience targeting. This, Chavez argued, could help companies reduce the costs of using third-party data, fill in gaps in the data, and help marketers run tests on various platforms faster and narrow down strategies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kana says this is all done while keeping humans in the loop so that marketers can approve the AI agents’ actions, give feedback, and customize what the agents do as their needs change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chavez and Vaidya emphasized the importance of the platform’s flexibility, arguing that the ability to deploy, tailor, and build new agents in real time would let marketers see results on their campaigns faster than they would with legacy systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Going forward, the startup sees that very flexibility to customize its platform for customers, doubling as its moat against incumbents and other startups building similar products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have the opportunity not to create bespoke solutions, but to highly tailor and configure these solutions to meet customers where they are. Larger companies just are never going to get there,” Chavez said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We live in a world which allows us to explore a third option [with customers]: not build, not buy, but build with — build with in a way which is supported,” Vaidya added. “We can move with insane speed that these big companies just cannot. And that’s our advantage.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kana will use the fresh cash to expand hiring across engineering, product, and go-to-market. Mayfield managing partner Navin Chaddha is joining the company’s board. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
