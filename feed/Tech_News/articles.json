The company now claims that Mullenweg intended to target 10 different hosting companies with royalty payments for their use of the WordPress trademark and tried to get payment processor Stripe to cancel its contract with WP Engine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the heart of the dispute, Mullenweg believes WP Engine is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/matt-mullenweg-calls-wp-engine-a-cancer-to-wordpress-and-urges-community-to-switch-providers/\">profiting</a> from the open-source WordPress project without contributing back to the community, and demanded the hosting company pay 8% of its monthly gross revenues as a royalty fee for using the WordPress brand.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The suit, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/wp-engine-sues-automattic-and-wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg/\">originally filed</a> by WP Engine in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://automattic.com/2024/10/31/legal-response-to-wp-engine/\">October 2024</a>, accused Automattic and Mullenweg of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/12/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/\">defamation and abuse of power</a>. Automattic filed its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/24/automattic-files-counterclaims-against-wp-engine-in-wordpress-lawsuit-alleging-trademark-misuse/\">counterclaims</a> last year, alleging that the hosting company has been abusing the WordPress trademark and engaging in deceptive marketing practices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this latest filing, WP Engine has amended its complaint for the third time after gaining access to information that was uncovered during the discovery process. The information, now unredacted, had been previously sealed at Automattic’s request.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, one of the new claims accuses Automattic of allegedly planning to target 10 other competitors with royalty claims similar to those aimed at WP Engine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The complaint also states that Newfold, a company whose portfolio includes hosting providers like Bluehost and HostGator, among others, is already paying Automattic for use of its trademarks and that Automattic is in conversations with others. (Names of the other hosts were redacted in the complaint, which referenced email conversations between those companies and Mullenweg.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WP Engine is also alleging that Mullenweg reached out to a Stripe executive via email to pressure the company to cancel WP Engine’s contract. This occurred after WP Engine had filed its lawsuit against Automattic, the complaint states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The filing also challenges the 8% rate for the royalty payments as being somewhat arbitrary. Referencing Mullenweg’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg-says-a-fork-would-be-fantastic/\">comments at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024</a>, WP Engine claims that the Automattic founder essentially came up with the rate because it was what he thought WP Engine “could afford to pay.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Matt Mullenweg: The Future of WordPress and the Web | TechCrunch Disrupt 2024\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn_HzfI_sW0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Disrupt, Mullenweg had responded to a question about how he settled on the 8% fee by saying it was based on a “business analysis.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you estimate that would be about $32 million — they still would have been free cash-flow positive, and based on our estimates, and the negotiations over the past 18 months, we felt like that was a fair amount,” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn_HzfI_sW0\">he said at the event.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other new claims in the filing point to aggressive language Mullenweg allegedly used against WP Engine, like threats that if the web hosting provider didn’t comply, he would start stealing its customers. “If they don’t take the carrot, we’ll give them the stick,” was one of the quotes cited from internal correspondence at Automattic, for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The complaint also includes allegations that Mullenweg used the term “nuclear war” to describe his approach to WP Engine’s defiance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Automattic did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That seems to be the case for Spotify at least, which shared this week during <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/spotify-hits-a-record-751m-monthly-users-thanks-to-wrapped-new-free-features/\">its fourth-quarter earnings call</a> that the best developers at the company “have not written a single line of code since December.” That statement, from Spotify co-CEO Gustav Söderström, came alongside other comments about how the company is using AI to accelerate development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of note, Spotify pointed out it shipped more than 50 new features and changes to its streaming app throughout 2025. And, most recently, it has rolled out more features, like AI-powered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/spotify-brings-ai-powered-prompted-playlists-to-the-u-s-and-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Prompted Playlists</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/spotify-ventures-into-physical-book-sales-adds-new-audiobook-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Page Match</a> for audiobooks, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/spotifys-new-feature-lets-you-explore-the-story-behind-the-song-youre-listening-to/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">About This Song</a>, which all launched within the past few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Spotify, engineers are using an internal system called “Honk” to speed up coding and product velocity, the company told analysts on the call. This system allows for things like remote, real-time code deployment using generative AI, and specifically Claude Code. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a concrete example, an engineer at Spotify on their morning commute from Slack on their cell phone can tell Claude to fix a bug or add a new feature to the iOS app,” Söderström said. “And once Claude finishes that work, the engineer then gets a new version of the app, pushed to them on Slack on their phone, so that he can then merge it to production, all before they even arrive at the office.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify credited the system in helping to speed up coding and deployment “tremendously.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We foresee this not being the end of the line in terms of AI development, just the beginning,” Söderström said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec also touted Spotify’s ability to build a unique dataset that other LLMs could not commoditize, the way they could other online resources, like Wikipedia. That’s because there’s not always a factual answer for music-related questions, he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if you asked what workout music is, you’d get different answers from different people, sometimes based on their geography. Americans tend to prefer hip-hop overall, though millions prefer death metal. And while a number of Europeans would work out to EDM, many Scandinavians like heavy metal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a dataset that we are building right now that no one else is really building. It does not exist at this scale. And we see it improving every time we retrain our models,” Söderström noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Analysts on the call also asked about Spotify’s approach to AI-generated music. The company explained that it’s allowing artists and labels to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/spotify-updates-ai-policy-to-label-tracks-cut-down-on-spam/\">indicate in a track’s metadata</a> how the song was made but is still policing the platform for spam.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, OpenAI announced the release of a light-weight version of its agentic coding tool Codex, the latest model of which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-new-agentic-coding-model-only-minutes-after-anthropic-drops-its-own/\">OpenAI launched</a> earlier this month. GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is described by the company as a “smaller version” of that model, one that is designed for faster inference. To power that inference, OpenAI has brought in a dedicated chip from its hardware partner Cerebras, marking a new level of integration in the company’s physical infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/cerebras-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnership</a> between Cerebras and OpenAI was announced last month, when OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/openai-signs-deal-reportedly-worth-10-billion-for-compute-from-cerebras/\">said that</a> it had reached a multi-year agreement with the firm worth over $10 billion. “Integrating Cerebras into our mix of compute solutions is all about making our AI respond much faster,” the company said at the time. Now, OpenAI calls Spark the “first milestone” in that relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spark, which OpenAI says is designed for swift, real-time collaboration and “rapid iteration,” will be powered by Cerebras’ Wafer Scale Engine 3. The WSE-3 is Cerebras’ <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-chip-cs3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">third-generation</a> waferscale megachip, decked out with 4 trillion transistors. OpenAI describes the new lightweight tool as a “daily productivity driver, helping users with rapid prototyping” rather than the longer, heavier tasks that the original 5.3 is designed for. Spark is currently enjoying a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users in the Codex app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2021984777470193767\">tweet</a> in advance of the announcement, CEO Sam Altman seemed to hint at the new model. “We have a special thing launching to Codex users on the Pro plan later today,” Altman tweeted. “It sparks joy for me.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its official statement, OpenAI emphasized Spark as designed for the lowest possible latency on Codex. “Codex-Spark is the first step toward a Codex that works in two complementary modes: real-time collaboration when you want rapid iteration, and long-running tasks when you need deeper reasoning and execution,” OpenAI shared. The company added that Cerebras’ chips excel at assisting “workflows that demand extremely low latency.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras has been around <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">for over a decade</a> but, in the AI era, it has enjoyed an increasingly prominent role in the tech industry. Just last week, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/benchmark-raises-225m-in-special-funds-to-double-down-on-cerebras/\">announced that</a> it had raised $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/press-release/cerebras-systems-raises-usd1-billion-series-h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$23 billion</a>. The company has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/cerebras-ceo-says-chipmakers-aspiration-is-to-hold-ipo-in-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously announced</a> its intentions to pursue an IPO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What excites us most about GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is partnering with OpenAI and the developer community to discover what fast inference makes possible — new interaction patterns, new use cases, and a fundamentally different model experience,” Sean Lie, CTO and co-founder of Cerebras, said in a statement. “This preview is just the beginning.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora’s self-driving trucks can now travel nonstop on a 1,000-mile route between Fort Worth and Phoenix — exceeding what a human driver can legally accomplish.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The distance, and the time it takes to travel it, offers up positive financial implications for Aurora — and any other company hoping to commercialize self-driving semitrucks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It takes Aurora about 15 hours to carry freight in its driverless trucks on the 1,000-mile journey, according to the company. Human truck drivers take much longer to complete the same distance due to federal regulations that limit how long they can be behind the wheel. For instance, truck drivers must stop for a 30-minute break after eight hours and can operate a semitruck for a maximum of 11 hours at a time, according to federal regulations. Once drivers hit that threshold, they cannot get behind the wheel for another 10 hours. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This represents more than a technological achievement,” Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson said during the company’s earnings call Wednesday afternoon. “It is the dawn of a superhuman future for freight.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also offers compelling economics to its customers, which includes Uber Freight, Werner, FedEx, and Schneider. The company said that eventually it can cut transit times nearly in half, a stat that has won over companies like Hirschbach, an early customer on the Fort Worth-to-Phoenix route. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora said in a <a href=\"https://ir.aurora.tech/_assets/_34bf7c715e4760047d5e07c538ed5bb5/aurora/db/956/10012/shareholder_letter/25Q4+Shareholder+Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">letter to shareholders</a> that it is poised to expand across the Sun Belt of the United States. Today, the company operates driverless trucks — some with a human observer still in the cab — on routes between Dallas and Houston, Fort Worth and El Paso, El Paso and Phoenix, Fort Worth and Phoenix, and Laredo and Dallas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion has helped Aurora transition from a developer of autonomous trucks to a commercial operator who is earning money on its driverless routes. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora has brought in revenue since April 2025 when it first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/aurora-launches-commercial-self-driving-truck-service-in-texas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deployed driverless, heavy-duty trucks for commercial use</a> on public roads. Aurora reported $1 million in the fourth quarter and $3 million for the year, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001828108/000182810826000016/aur-20251231.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to a report</a> filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company’s CFO, David Maday, said total year adjusted revenue, which includes money earned through pilot programs early last year, was $4 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s a tiny figure, especially when compared to its expenses. Aurora reported a net income loss of $816 million in 2025, up 9% from the year before as it focuses on scaling its operations. Still, it shows measurable progress from 2024, when it didn’t recognize any revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revenue is projected to continue as the company adds more trucks and driverless routes to its network. Today, the company has 30 trucks in the fleet, 10 of which are operating driverlessly. That fleet is expected to grow to more than 200 trucks by the end of the year. Urmson said the company’s trucks have racked up 250,000 driverless miles as of January 2026 with a perfect safety record.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the second quarter, Aurora plans to deploy a fleet of driverless International Motors LT trucks, which will not have a human observer on board. Aurora’s driverless operations that use Paccar trucks currently have a human safety observer in the cab as requested by the truck manufacturer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Urmson took a bullish view of Aurora’s future, buoyed by advancements in its self-driving software, an impending second-generation hardware kit that will lower costs, and expansion of its driverless routes. The expansion of its driverless trucking routes has been propelled by a new software release, its fourth since launching commercial service in April 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first release validated initial driverless operations between Dallas and Houston, the second validated operations at night, and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/aurora-expands-self-driving-trucks-route-to-el-paso/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">third validated El Paso</a>, according to Aurora. The company said this latest software release will give its self-driving system the capabilities to navigate the diverse geography and climate of the southern United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just as the last two years brought robotaxis into the mainstream, we expect 2026 to mark the inflection point where the market recognizes that self-driving trucks have arrived and are quickly becoming a permanent fixture in our transportation landscape,” Urmson said on the company’s earnings call. “If you’re in the Sun Belt in 2026, you won’t just read about the Aurora driver. You’ll see it every day.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora currently operates driverless routes through Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and has future driverless operations planned for Nevada, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, the company said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On January 23, 2026, U.S. investment firms Greenoaks and Altimeter <a href=\"https://www.immigration.go.kr/bbs/moj/183/602757/artclView.do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a notice</a> with South Korea’s Ministry of Justice, saying they suffered losses from what they characterized as the government’s discriminatory investigation into the data breach. They said they plan to pursue investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS) arbitration under the U.S.-Korea FTA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea’s Ministry of Justice <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moj.go.kr/moj/222/subview.do?enc=Zm5jdDF8QEB8JTJGYmJzJTJGbW9qJTJGMTgzJTJGNjAzNDc2JTJGYXJ0Y2xWaWV3LmRvJTNGcGFzc3dvcmQlM0QlMjZyZ3NCZ25kZVN0ciUzRCUyNmJic0NsU2VxJTNEJTI2cmdzRW5kZGVTdHIlM0QlMjZpc1ZpZXdNaW5lJTNEZmFsc2UlMjZwYWdlJTNEMSUyNmJic09wZW5XcmRTZXElM0QlMjZzcmNoQ29sdW1uJTNEJTI2c3JjaFdyZCUzRCUyNg%3D%3D\">said</a> Thursday that three more investors, including Abrams Capital, Durable Capital Partners, and Foxhaven Asset Management have now joined the case. They are alleging the government acted unlawfully toward the e-commerce company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To recap the incident: In December, Coupang disclosed that nearly 34 million Korean customers’ personal information had been leaked in a data breach that had been going on for more than five months. The breach involved customer names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and certain order histories, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While other tech breaches in Korea resulted in less severe penalties, Coupang has faced extraordinary government pressure. The government reportedly threatened <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/companies/20251201/coupang-faces-potential-770-mil-fine-after-data-breach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">massive fines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/companies/20251221/coupang-faces-possible-business-suspension-after-massive-data-breach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suspension of operations</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/companies/20260112/police-mull-overseas-travel-ban-on-coupang-chief-in-data-breach-investigation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">travel bans</a> for executives while Coupang’s investors allege it also sought <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.sedaily.com/society/2025/12/31/labor-minister-warns-officials-against-contact-with-ex\">to block public communication</a> and repeatedly misrepresented the scope of the breach.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Korea’s Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) said that more than 30 million Coupang accounts were exposed — but the facts point to just 3,000 affected accounts, according to Coupang’s investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, South Korea’s government and the <a href=\"https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/12/17/NXHCHEF2B5BWTB5WZ5UGYKYU4A/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PIPC said</a> the Coupang breach was serious enough to justify higher fines. Under current law, penalties are capped at 3% of revenue, more than $800 million for Coupang, according to the U.S. investors, but some lawmakers have proposed raising the limit to 10% and applying it retroactively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if the new law passes, it wouldn’t apply to Coupang, since the breach occurred before the rules changed. But a Democratic Party lawmaker in the country suggested imposing punitive fines, through either new legislation or a special parliamentary act, and PIPC backed the idea, <a href=\"https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20251217_0003445328\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per news reports</a>.

In the filing, they argue:  </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Government’s unprecedented assault on a U.S. company to benefit its Korean and Chinese competitors is an egregious violation of the Treaty, principles of international law, and the historic partnership between Korea and the United States … The Government’s shocking conduct has left the U.S. investors with no choice. If the Government does not immediately cease its attacks against Coupang, fully restore the company’s ability to operate its business, and permanently end its longstanding campaign of discrimination against the company, then the U.S. investors will be forced to seek billions of dollars in damages from Korea to protect their investments in Coupang and remedy the Government’s ongoing Treaty violations, including attempted expropriation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The filing is a preliminary, pre-litigation step. South Korea’s <a href=\"https://www.moj.go.kr/bbs/moj/439/603008/artclView.do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ministry of Justice</a> is now reviewing the notice of intent, which kicks off <a href=\"https://cil.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SIAA-Day3-AndreaMenaker-Pre-arbitration-Requirements.pdf#:~:text=notice%20of%20its%20intention%20to%20submit%20a%20claim%20to%20arbitration%20at%20least%2090&amp;text=%E2%80%A2%20%E2%80%9CRequest%20for%20consultations%E2%80%9D%20triggers%206%2Dmonth%20period.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a mandatory 90-day consultation period</a> before formal arbitration can begin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coupang, Abrams Capital, and Foxhaven Asset Management did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Durable Capital Partners could not be reached.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the investors’ filing, South Korea’s handling of data breaches has been inconsistent, specifically citing other recent data breaches in South Korea, including KakaoPay, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/a-timeline-of-south-korean-telco-giant-skts-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SK Telecom</a>, Upbit, and Alibaba’s AliExpress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">KakaoPay reportedly transferred 54 billion customer records to Alipay Singapore, yet faced <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/economy/20250409/fss-fines-kakao-pay-10-mil-for-illegally-transferring-customer-data-to-alipay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">only a $10 million fine</a> and a CEO warning, while <a href=\"https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20260119009200315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SK Telecom was fined $91 million</a> after a massive SIM card breach. <a href=\"https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/south-korean-police-probe-30-million-upbit-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Upbit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/e-commerce/newsView/ked202407250013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AliExpress</a> also saw minimal government action. The investors say these examples underscore the stark contrast with the government’s response to Coupang.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT said Wednesday that the Coupang data breach was carried out by a former employee who had worked on the company’s authentication systems and was aware of vulnerabilities in both the authentication framework and key management system. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Ministry alleges that Coupang failed to report the breach to the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency (KISA) within 24 hours and did not fully implement a November 2025 data preservation order, leading to the deletion of key web and app access logs. The ministry has referred the matter to investigators and ordered Coupang to submit a prevention plan by February 2026, with compliance monitored through July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coupang <a href=\"https://www.aboutcoupang.com/English/news/news-details/2026/response-to-the-jit-report-regarding-the-november-2025-data-incident/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released a statement</a>, saying that the employee, a Chinese national, accessed data from over 33 million accounts but retained only about 3,000 before deleting it, and that no sensitive info such as payment data, passwords, or government IDs was accessed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coupang also replaced its CEO, Park Dae-jun, with Harold Rogers, its U.S. parent’s top lawyer, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/ceo-of-south-korean-retail-giant-coupang-resigns-after-massive-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in December</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adam Farrar, senior associate at CSIS and senior geoeconomics analyst for APAC at Bloomberg, said on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV8JR9df8U8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tuesday’s Impossible State podcast</a> that what began as a major data breach involving Coupang has grown into a broader issue between the United States and South Korea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Farrar said that the case is amplifying broader U.S. claims of unfair treatment toward American technology firms, raising trade and tariff risks for South Korea as <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-news-world/congress-targets-south-korean-regulators-over-discriminatory-treatment-us-tech-companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the U.S. Congress</a> becomes increasingly engaged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The massive data breach [by Coupang] led to a series of investigations in the National Assembly and some very combative back and forth with Coupang and a series of executives over the past several months,” Farrar said in the podcast. “The additional dynamic here is that Coupang, while driving almost all of its earnings from Korea, is now a U.S.-based company that adds to the dynamic on both sides, impacting how they’re perceived and seen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue extends beyond Coupang, raising broader questions about whether South Korea is unfairly targeting U.S. companies, Farrar continued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Critics point to digital policies they say favor domestic firms, including network usage fees on content providers like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/south-korean-isp-sk-broadband-counterclaims-against-netflix-for-bandwidth-usage-fees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/google-apple-face-fines-in-south-korea-for-breaching-in-app-billing-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple’s App Store and Google Play</a> payment rules, and data localization requirements that limit services like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/seoul-weighs-approval-for-google-apple-high-resolution-map-requests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Maps</a> on national security grounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Under the deal, which was worth just under $70 million, Apple’s in-house studio will be producing the show’s future seasons. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is similar to one Apple struck with AMC Studios for sci-fi show “Silo” after season one. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Severance” will now be one of Apple’s marquee titles, joining popular series such as “Your Friends and Neighbors” and “Stick.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Deadline, the production costs for “Severance” had exceeded what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already requested advances from Apple and was considering relocating production from New York to Canada for bigger and quicker tax rebates. Since Apple definitely has the funds to back the show, the company decided to take full control.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Severance” is important to the streamer, as the show’s second season became Apple’s most-watched series at the time.

The company, which bills itself as the first “AI-native, full-stack auto retail business” for electric vehicles, already has thousands of customers buying and selling their EVs on the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now it’s looking to scale with help from a $31 million Series A funding round led by Eclipse, with Ibex Investors, Lifeline Ventures, and JIMCO — the investment arm of the Saudi Arabian Jameel family (an early investor in Rivian) — as co-investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last decade, companies like Carvana and CarMax helped usher in the digital car-buying experience. More recently, myriad startups have tried to improve the car-buying experience with AI, pitching ideas like voice agents or smarter scheduling software. Eclipse’s Jiten Behl thinks this is the wrong approach if you want to really modernize the automotive retail experience, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These bolt-on AI tools are band-aids,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch. He likened it to how many major automakers’ first EVs were essentially combustion vehicles that were repackaged to fit electric drivetrains. That approach came with major tradeoffs compared to designing a new EV from the ground up, which was the approach companies like Tesla and Rivian took.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Auto retail is a perfect candidate for disrupting with AI, you know? It’s a lot of process, lot of labor, [very] rules-based,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lasse-Mathias Nyberg, Ever co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that buying or selling a car typically triggers “hundreds or thousands of different actions” that a retailer needs to perform in order to complete the transaction. “There’s massive complexities or frictions on both sides.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, he and his team set out to reduce or remove those complexities. What they settled on after a year of research was a digital-first auto retailer. The core tech is an orchestration layer or “operating system” that can handle all the different workflows behind a transaction, whether it’s processing information submitted by a prospective buyer or seller, or managing the vehicle inventory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you do appraisals, or pricing, or titling, it’s very deterministic in terms of what steps need to be taken. And today, there are lots of single point solution tools that are used,” he said. Most companies “use these tools together in a very inefficient manner, and you think that you are on a digital journey — but if you actually could clean-sheet it, and if you actually could use the power of agentic AI, and you can create one unified customer experience and remove all these micro-frictions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nyberg claimed that building the company this way has allowed Ever’s sales team to be two to three times more productive than they would be otherwise, and he expects that to scale as the company grows. He said this extra efficiency and productivity beefs up their margins, which can be booked as profit or passed along to the customer by offering lower prices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ever applies this fresh approach to both its online marketplace and physical locations. Nyberg said the hybrid model is important because seeing and trying a car in person remains crucial to the shopping experience for a lot of buyers — especially those who might be assessing EVs for the first time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early reviews of Ever’s product have been mixed. Users on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/electriccars/comments/1jykj9z/has_anyone_ever_bought_from_evercarscom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one particular Reddit thread</a> from last year were split, with some drawn to how Ever is making EVs easier to buy, while others detailed struggles getting in touch with the startup’s team. Ever was just getting off the ground and was more or less operating in stealth, and so Nyberg chalks that up to a learning experience. He said his team is working hard to make sure its system can be flexible enough to accomplish everything the company has set out to do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger challenge may be overall interest in EVs, which has cooled a bit in the United States. Nyberg said he hasn’t ruled out Ever buying or selling used combustion cars in the future, but wants to stick to EVs in the near-term since there isn’t a retailer that is laser-focused on these vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Behl, who spent eight years on Rivian’s leadership team, admitted he’s a “hopeless romantic when it comes to EVs,” and said he still believes the industry is moving toward electric propulsion because of the inherent benefits. And he said his “first thought” when he started doing diligence on Ever was: “I wish Rivian was doing this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More broadly, Behl said, companies like Carvana are still in the single digits of market share when it comes to automotive retail. That’s why he sees so much upside in Ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Customers are going to continue to gravitate towards better experience when it comes to buying cars, which means it is going to be a digitally-led customer experience which takes away all the friction of buying and selling a car,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Details of the Tuesday night meeting were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/elon-musk-lunar-factory.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously reported by The New York Times</a>, which may have influenced xAI’s decision to post the video online.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The full video reveals significant new details about Musk’s plans for the AI lab, including its product roadmap and its ongoing ties to the X platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most immediate revelation concerned a string of departing employees, which Musk described as layoffs resulting from a changing organizational structure at the company. While reorganizations are common, the breadth of the departures has caused significant confusion, particularly as it has meant the loss of a significant portion of the founding team.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve,” Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2021673886157607383\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said on X</a>. “This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new organizational system splits xAI into four primary teams: one focused on the Grok chatbot (including voice), another for the app’s coding system, another for the Imagine video generator, and finally a team focused on the Macrohard project, which spans from simple computer use simulation to modeling entire corporations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Macrohard] is able to do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do,” Toby Pohlen, who will lead the project under the new organizational structure, told his colleagues. “There should be rocket engines fully designed by AI.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3092311\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg 1268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=680,444 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=1200,784 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=430,281 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=720,470 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=900,588 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=800,522 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=668,436 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=574,375 574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=945,617 945w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=708,462 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screen-Shot-2026-02-11-at-3.21.27-PM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>xAI (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The all-hands also featured claims about new usage and revenue figures for xAI and X.

Should the deal close at these terms, the funding round would more than double the company’s valuation of <a href=\"https://modal.com/blog/announcing-our-series-b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$1.1 billion</a> announced less than five months ago, when it announced an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://modal.com/blog/announcing-our-series-b\">$87 million</a> Series B round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Catalyst is in talks to lead the round, the people told TechCrunch. Modal’s annualized revenue run rate (ARR) is approximately $50 million, our sources said. The discussions are early, and terms could still change.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modal Labs co-founder and CEO Erik Bernhardsson denied that his company was actively fundraising and characterized his recent interactions with VCs as general conversations. General Catalyst did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modal is focused on optimizing inference, the process of running trained AI models to generate answers from user requests. Improving inference efficiency reduces compute costs and cuts down the lag time between a user’s prompt and the AI’s response.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modal is one of the handful of inference-focused companies attracting intense investor attention now. Last week, its competitor Baseten announced a <a href=\"https://www.baseten.co/blog/announcing-baseten-s-300m-series-e/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$300 million raise</a> at a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the $2.1 billion valuation it reached just months prior in September. Similarly, Fireworks AI, an inference cloud provider, secured $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, the creators of the open source inference project vLLM announced they had transitioned the tool into a VC-backed startup, Inferact, raising $150 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz at an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/inference-startup-inferact-lands-150m-to-commercialize-vllm/\">$800 million valuation</a>.

This unfortunately required parting ways with some people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that the company is “hiring aggressively” and closed with a quintessentially Musk pitch: “Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Losing half your co-founders in a relatively short period raises questions, and Musk’s comments seem designed to control the narrative, reframing the exits as necessary rather than a problem for the outfit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, at least 10 engineers, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/nearly-half-of-xais-founding-team-has-now-left-the-company/\">two co-founders</a>, have publicly announced their departure from xAI in the past week — though two of those exits appear to have occurred a few weeks ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three of the departing staff members have said they will be starting something new alongside other former xAI engineers, although no details are available about the new venture. Others have hinted at a desire for more autonomy and smaller teams to build frontier tech more rapidly, pointing to the anticipated surge in AI productivity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead, <a href=\"https://x.com/Yuhu_ai_/status/2021113745024614671\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a post</a> announcing his resignation: “It’s time for my next chapter.

The company is facing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">regulatory scrutiny</a> after Grok created nonconsensual explicit deepfakes of women and children that were disseminated on X — <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/paris-prosecutors-raid-x-offices-as-part-of-investigation-over-child-abuse-images-deepfakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">French authorities last week raided X</a> offices as part of an investigation. The company is also moving toward a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">planned IPO </a>later this year, after being <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legally acquired by SpaceX</a> last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk is also facing personal controversy after files published by the Justice Department show extended conversations with convicted rapist and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The emails show Musk <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/expressed-interest-visiting-jeffrey-epstein-island-emails-show-doj-rcna256784\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discussing a visit to Epstein’s island</a> on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013. Epstein was first convicted of procuring a child for prostitution in 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI maintains a headcount of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-org-chart-employees-elon-musk-direct-reports-2025-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over 1,000 employees</a>, so the departures are unlikely to affect the company’s short-term capabilities. Still, the rapid pace of the recent departures had taken on a life of its own online, with users jokingly announcing on X that they too are “leaving xAI” despite never having worked there — a sign of how quickly the narrative of a “mass exodus” snowballed on Musk’s social network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, forced co-founder exits are rarely a sign of smooth scaling. While Musk frames the reorganization as calculated, the fact that several engineers followed the co-founders out the door — and that at least three are starting something new together — suggests the departures may also reflect deeper tensions. In frontier AI, where talent is scarce and reputation matters, xAI’s ability to attract and retain top researchers will be tested as it competes with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-timeline-of-departure-announcements\">Timeline of departure announcements</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The following employees have publicly announced their departures from xAI on X in recent days:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>February 6:  </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/ayushjaiswal/status/2019857451823296876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ayush Jaiswal</a>, engineer, wrote: “This was my last week at xAI.

At least two flaws can be exploited by tricking someone into clicking a malicious link on their Windows computer. Another can result in a compromise on opening a malicious Office file.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vulnerabilities are known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">zero-days</a>, because the hackers were exploiting the bugs before Microsoft had time to fix them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Details of how to exploit the bugs have been published, Microsoft said, potentially increasing the chance of hacks. Microsoft did not say where they had been published, and a Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately comment when reached by TechCrunch. In its bug reports, Microsoft acknowledged the input of security researchers in Google’s Threat Intelligence Group in their discovery of the vulnerabilities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft said one of the bugs, officially tracked as <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21510\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CVE-2026-21510</a>, was found in the Windows shell, which powers the operating system’s user interface. The bug affects all supported versions of Windows, the company said. When a victim clicks on a malicious link from their computer, the bug allows hackers to bypass Microsoft’s SmartScreen feature that would typically screen malicious links and files for malware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2026/2/10/the-february-2026-security-update-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">security expert Dustin Childs</a>, this bug can be abused to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#remote-code-execution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">remotely plant malware</a> on the victim’s computer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is user interaction here, as the client needs to click a link or a shortcut file,” Childs wrote in his blog post. “Still, a one-click bug to gain code execution is a rarity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Google spokesperson confirmed that the Windows shell bug was under “widespread, active exploitation,” and said successful hacks allowed the silent execution of malware with high privileges, “posing a high risk of subsequent system compromise, deployment of ransomware, or intelligence collection.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another Windows bug, tracked as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2026-21513\">CVE-2026-21513</a>, was found in Microsoft’s proprietary browser engine, MSHTML, which powers its legacy and long-discontinued Internet Explorer browser. It’s still found in newer versions of Windows to ensure backward compatibility with older apps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft said this bug allows hackers to bypass security features in Windows to plant malware.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to independent security reporter Brian Krebs, Microsoft also patched <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/patch-tuesday-february-2026-edition/\">three other zero-day bugs</a> in its software that were being actively exploited by hackers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In a <a href=\"https://speedrun.substack.com/p/what-we-look-for-in-applications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">January blog post,</a> the program said that over 19,000 startups pitched and fewer than 0.4% were accepted into the latest cohort. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The program used to focus on gaming startups, then expanded into entertainment and media, and is now a “horizontal program,” Joshua Lu, the program’s general manager and a partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. Today, founders of any type of startup can apply, and the program runs for about 12 weeks in San Francisco. It once had a program in Los Angeles, but Lu said the focus will be on SF from now on. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are two cohorts a year, and around 50 to 70 startups are accepted into each. The program <a href=\"https://speedrun.a16z.com/the-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invests up to $1 million</a> into each company, though the downside is that it’s a bit pricey. It typically invests $500,000 up front in exchange for 10% of the startup’s company via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months, at whatever terms agreed to by the other investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, Y Combinator <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/deal\">typically takes a fixed 7% </a>of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 “invested on an uncapped MFN safe.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speedrun said its program is more “equity expensive” because of what it offers founders. It provides them with access to a16z’s advisory and business networks that assist with tasks like go-to-market, brand development, media strategy, and talent sourcing. Plus it offers the startups perks like $5 million in credits to vendors such as AWS, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Deel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the high interest, and low acceptance rate, TechCrunch spoke to Lu for some tips on how startups can best stand out. The latest cohort began in January and will end in April with a Demo Day. Applications for <a href=\"https://speedrun.a16z.com/apply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the next cohort open in April,</a> though it looks at off-season applications year-round, Lu said. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focus-on-the-founding-team-nbsp-nbsp\">Focus on the founding team  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speedrun focuses on early-stage startups. Because of this, they really examine who is on the founding team and whether their skills complement each other, Lu said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That doesn’t mean one has to be technical and one has to be commercial and one has to be marketing,” Lu said. It means that “we prefer not to see any glaring holes in capabilities or interests. We want the founding team to be self-aware and for that to be part of the hiring plan.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also like to see teams that have worked together before or have a shared history. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are lots of things that a founding team has to navigate in their startup journey and having a bit of pattern recognition, being able to work with each other, knowing how to disagree and how to come out the other side of a disagreement, those are all things people on founding teams with shared histories have an easier time with, on average,” he continued. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though AI has lowered the barriers to building software, it’s still incredibly helpful for a founding team to be technical, Lu said. At the same time, because AI has made it much faster to build and validate hypotheses and get a product out there, Lu said the Speedrun team likes to see when a startup already has a little bit of market validation or traction for their product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Speedrun as a program is really great at helping teams pour gasoline on a very small spark or fire,” he said. “We look for teams that have endeavored to build and try to show us that there’s a little spark we can fan the flames on.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-limit-the-market-theory\">Limit the market “theory”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu said one common mistake founders often make in the application process is spending too much energy talking about the market theory or why there is a defined problem and why their solution is the right one. “All of that may be true,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, he added, even the biggest, most successful tech companies faced unexpected blockades when they were young, sometimes even pivoting completely. What a company thinks it’s going to build at the beginning isn’t necessarily what will make it successful at the end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we really want to hear about is why this founding team is really good together,” he continued, “why they’re a great founding team, the best possible founding team to solve this particular problem.” And then on top of that, any validation on the idea itself. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-okay-to-use-ai-for-the-application-but\">It’s okay to use AI for the application, but…</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu said the program encourages every founder to use AI to “clean up” their application. He said there is now no excuse for grammar errors or misspellings given the rising sophistication of AI tools. He also said AI can help founders sort out their thoughts, making them clearer, more concise, and more coherent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if AI did all the work in explaining the startup, that may backfire. If a founder makes it to the next round, it will be a live video-call interview. “At that point, their live narration explanation skills are going to be put to the test,” he said. So founders should be prepared to talk cogently about their startup without the help of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Only about 10% of founders make it to the video-call stage. There are typically two to three investors on the judging panel at a time. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the live interview, the team typically conducts a few more screening calls with the founders, and then a final decision on the cohort is made. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-be-greedy-to-network\">Be greedy to network</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are, of course, other accelerator programs for startups to choose from. Lu said Speedrun itself was inspired by some of these other programs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, he said, this accelerator prides itself on giving founders access to a large, specialized operating team. In fact, he said the best teams that get the most out of the program are the ones most “greedy about getting exposure to the amazing people and programs” Speedrun has to offer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu listed off just a few points: a16z has around 600 people, and 10% of that staff is on the investment team, he said; everyone else is an operator who supports the companies the firm works with. As a result, founders in Speedrun will have access to experts who can help with marketing, banking, finance, management, and many other functions. So it helps to know who the startup wants to connect with and why. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We tell founders that come through the program, what you get out of Speedrun is what you put into it,” he said. “We think founders who want to take advantage of world experts in many different domains early in their startup journey would be really smart to choose us.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-advice-from-a-founder-in-the-program\">Advice from a founder in the program</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founder Mohamed Mohamed, who is in the recent cohort, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/proptech-startup-smart-bricks-raises-5-million-pre-seed-in-round-led-by-a16z/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">just announced a $5 million raise</a> for his proptech startup Smart Bricks led by a16z’s Speedrun. He was attracted to the program because he said it stood out as one of the few “explicitly designed for co-founders working on frontier AI applications,” and he picked it because he wanted a program that would allow him to “stress-test an ambitious technical vision.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mohamed said he treated the application like an internal strategy memo rather than a pitch. “Instead of polishing buzzwords, we focused on clarity — the real problem, why it’s structurally hard, and why our team is unusually well-positioned to solve it,” he said. “We were explicit about what was working, what wasn’t, and where we needed help. I think that honesty and clear articulation of why this problem matters” is what helped the company in the application process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He called the whole process “rigorous but refreshingly thoughtful,” and said it was designed to understand how founders think, not just what they have built so far. “The conversations went deep into product architecture, data strategy, and long-term ambition. It felt closer to a partner-level discussion than a typical accelerator interview, which was a strong signal for us,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His overall advice is to be “intellectually honest and precise.” For example, he said in his application he avoided “over-optimizing” for the sake of hyping up his company. “If you’re vague, derivative, or overly defensive about your idea, it shows quickly. Don’t try to sound bigger than you are; clarity about where you actually are is far more compelling than inflated narratives,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the end, “Speedrun isn’t looking for perfect companies; they’re looking for founders who can reason clearly about complex problems and build with conviction,” he said. “Articulate the hard parts of what you’re doing and why they’re worth tackling. Depth beats polish every time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction, story originally misstated YC’s investment for its 7%. It has been corrected.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The recipient clicks the link, which preloads the requested payment amount, allowing the transaction to be facilitated quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cash App says that the links can be used for recurring payments as well as group payments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cash App introduced the new feature after surveying Gen Z users and finding that it was common for multiple communications to occur around payments. The links are designed to alleviate any social awkwardness that may accompany those communications while also making payments more direct.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3092096\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png 1312w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=768,587 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=680,519 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=1200,916 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=1280,978 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=430,328 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=720,550 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=900,687 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=800,611 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=668,510 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=491,375 491w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=808,617 808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=695,531 695w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-at-10.45.36-AM.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Cash App</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Payment links make moving money even more seamless, but just as importantly, they make the task of requesting money feel more human and less awkward,” said Kristen Anderson, P2P &amp; Networks Product Lead at Cash App. “We’ve heard from our customers that sending in-app payment requests and push notifications can sometimes come across as overly formal or even passive-aggressive. Payment links solve this by allowing customers to send requests through whichever platform feels most natural so that they can add context, levity, or humor to the conversation.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cash App has added a number of new features lately, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/cash-app-debuts-a-new-ai-assistant-that-answers-questions-about-your-finances/\">an AI chatbot</a> that debuted late last year and is designed to advise users on their finances, as well as a new benefits program with a high-borrowing limit.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
