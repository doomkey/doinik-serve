This is the first time that OpenAI models will be offered by AWS, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. They will be available as a model choice with Amazon AI services Bedrock and SageMaker AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While anyone can download the models via Hugging Face, Amazon is offering these models with OpenAI’s full knowledge and approval, as Dmitry Pimenov, the model maker’s product lead, indicated in the announcement. A spokesperson described the offering as similar to how Amazon offered open model DeepSeek-R1 earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a juicy competitive move for both companies. For AWS, it finally puts the cloud giant in the same sentence as the biggest model maker, OpenAI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until now, AWS has best been known as a major host and a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/22/anthropic-raises-an-additional-4b-from-amazon-makes-aws-its-primary-cloud-partner/\">financial backer</a> of Anthropic’s Claude, one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors. AWS offers Claude, along with other models from makers such as Cohere, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/\">DeepSeek</a>, Meta, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/what-is-mistral-ai-everything-to-know-about-the-openai-competitor/\">Mistral</a>, as well as its own home-grown ones in its AI services. Specifically, Bedrock allows AWS customers to build and host generative AI apps using models of their choice. SageMaker, on the other hand, allows AWS customers to train, or even build, their own AI models largely for analytics uses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AWS’s ultimate rival, Microsoft, hasn’t <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/microsoft-is-no-longer-openais-exclusive-cloud-provider/\">had a lock on OpenAI models since January,</a> Azure is still OpenAI’s most significant cloud partner to date. OpenAI even announced that Microsoft is offering versions of these two new models, too, optimized for Windows devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Watching Microsoft win an increasing amount of cloud business with OpenAI has been a public pain in Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s neck. Just last week during <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-amazon-q2-2025-earnings-beat-expectations-93CH-4164802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon’s quarterly earnings call</a>, Jassy was pounded with questions from Wall Street analysts about how the company was losing ground in AI to competitors, particularly Microsoft.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Jassy to explain “significantly faster cloud growth among the number two and number three players in the space,” referring to Microsoft and Google. Later, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak told Jassy that Wall Street thinks “AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss, peers, etc.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jassy responded with a minutes-long diatribe that included this barb at Redmond: “I think the second player is about 65% of the size of the AWS.”<br><br>Meanwhile, another AWS competitor, Oracle, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/openai-agreed-to-pay-oracle-30b-a-year-for-data-center-services/?_thumbnail_id=1361055\">reported that it signed a $30 billion a year deal with OpenAI</a> to offer data center services. This means that OpenAI plans to pay Oracle more each year than all of its other cloud services customers combined. Until now, AWS had been left out of any OpenAI-related glory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for how such a move with AWS benefits OpenAI: The AI provider’s relationship with Microsoft <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/the-cracks-in-the-openai-microsoft-relationship-are-reportedly-widening/\">is notoriously strained</a>, as the two are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/microsoft-in-talks-to-maintain-access-to-openais-tech-beyond-agi-milestone/\">reportedly renegotiating their long-term partnership</a> deal. What better way for OpenAI to strengthen its position than to cozy up the biggest cloud provider, even if, initially, on a small scale?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, this partnership allows swaths of AWS enterprise customers to easily experiment with using OpenAI models with their hosted AI apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile Altman gets to undercut Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg with this move as well. As OpenAI releases these two high-performing models under an Apache 2.0 open source license, Meta recently admitted that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-meta-likely-wont-open-source-all-of-its-superintelligence-ai-models/\">it probably won’t continue to open source all of its upcoming “superintelligence” models.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Both are freely available to download from the online developer platform <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hugging Face</a>, the company said, describing the models as “state of the art” when measured across several benchmarks for comparing open models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models come in two sizes: a larger and more capable gpt-oss-120b model that can run on a single Nvidia GPU, and a lighter-weight gpt-oss-20b model that can run on a consumer laptop with 16GB of memory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch marks OpenAI’s first ‘open’ language model since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/\">GPT-2</a>, which was released more than five years ago. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a briefing, OpenAI said its open models will be capable of sending complex queries to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/openai-wants-its-open-ai-model-to-call-models-in-the-cloud-for-help/\">AI models in the cloud,</a> as TechCrunch previously reported. That means if OpenAI’s open model is not capable of a certain task, such as processing an image, developers can connect the open model to one of the company’s more capable closed models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI open sourced AI models in its early days, the company has generally favored a proprietary, closed source development approach. The latter strategy has helped OpenAI build a large business selling access to its AI models via an API to enterprises and developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, CEO Sam Altman said in January he believes OpenAI has been “on the wrong side of history” when it comes to open sourcing its technologies. The company today faces growing pressure from Chinese AI labs — including DeepSeek, Alibaba’s Qwen, and Moonshot AI — which have developed several of the world’s most capable and popular open models. (While Meta previously dominated the open AI space, the company’s Llama AI models have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/05/meta-releases-llama-4-a-new-crop-of-flagship-ai-models/\">fallen behind</a> in the last year.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July, the Trump administration also urged U.S. AI developers to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/\">open source more technology</a> to promote global adoption of AI aligned with American values.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div

class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the release of gpt-oss, OpenAI hopes to curry favor with developers and the Trump administration alike, both of which have watched the Chinese AI labs rise to prominence in the open source space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Going back to when we started in 2015, OpenAI’s mission is to ensure AGI that benefits all of humanity,” said Altman in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “To that end, we are excited for the world to be building on an open AI stack created in the United States, based on democratic values, available for free to all and for wide benefit.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

That’s more than triple the hallucination rate of OpenAI’s o1 model, which scored 16%, and higher than its o4-mini model, which scored 36%.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-training-the-new-models\">Training the new models</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says its open models were trained with similar processes to its proprietary models. The company says each open model leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE) to tap fewer parameters for any given question, making it run more efficiently. For gpt-oss-120b, which has 117 billion total parameters, OpenAI says the model only activates 5.1 billion parameters per token.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also says its open model was trained using high-compute <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/03/inside-openais-quest-to-make-ai-do-anything-for-you/\">reinforcement learning (RL)</a> — a post-training process to teach AI models right from wrong in simulated environments using large clusters of Nvidia GPUs. This was also used to train OpenAI’s o-series of models, and the open models have a similar chain-of-thought process in which they take additional time and computational resources to work through their answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result of the post-training process, OpenAI says its open AI models excel at powering AI agents and are capable of calling tools such as web search or Python code execution as part of its chain-of-thought process. However, OpenAI says its open models are text-only, meaning they will not be able to process or generate images and audio like the company’s other models.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is releasing gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b under the Apache 2.0 license, which is generally considered one of the most permissive. This license will allow enterprises to monetize OpenAI’s open models without having to pay or obtain permission from the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, unlike fully open source offerings from AI labs like AI2, OpenAI says it will not be releasing the training data used to create its open models. This decision is not surprising given that several active lawsuits against AI model providers, including OpenAI, have alleged that these companies inappropriately trained their AI models on copyrighted works.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/openais-open-model-is-delayed/\">delayed</a> the release of its open models <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/\">several</a> times in recent months, partially to address safety concerns. Beyond the company’s typical safety policies, OpenAI says in a white paper that it also investigated whether bad actors could fine-tune its gpt-oss models to be more helpful in cyberattacks or the creation of biological or chemical weapons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After testing from OpenAI and third-party evaluators, the company says gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities. However, it did not find evidence that these open models could reach its “high capability” threshold for danger in these domains, even after fine-tuning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI’s model appears to be state-of-the-art among open models, developers are eagerly awaiting the release of DeepSeek R2, its next AI reasoning model, as well as a new open model from Meta’s Superintelligence Lab.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They argued that Perplexity accessing sites in defiance of the website owner’s wishes, while controversial, is acceptable. And this is a controversy that will certainly grow as AI agents flood the internet: Should an agent accessing a website on behalf of its user be treated like a bot? Or like a human making the same request?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare is known for providing anti-bot crawling and other web security services to millions of websites. Essentially, Cloudflare’s test case involved setting up a new website with a new domain that had never been crawled by any bot, setting up a robots.txt file that specifically blocked Perplexity’s known AI crawling bots, and then asking Perplexity about the website’s content. And Perplexity answered the question. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare researchers found the AI search engine used “a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS” when its web crawler itself was blocked. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince <a href=\"https://x.com/eastdakota/status/1952379571527193017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted </a>the research on X, writing, “Some supposedly ‘reputable’ AI companies act more like North Korean hackers. Time to name, shame, and hard block them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But many people disagreed with Prince’s assessment that this was actual bad behavior. Those defending Perplexity on sites <a href=\"https://x.com/Chikor_Zi/status/1952382355059913193\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like X</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44785636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hacker News</a> pointed out that what Cloudflare seemed to document was the AI accessing a specific public website when its user asked about that specific website. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If I as a human request a website, then I should be shown the content,” one person on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44786039\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hacker News</a> wrote, adding, “why would the LLM accessing the website on my behalf be in a different legal category as my Firefox web browser?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Perplexity spokesperson <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/perplexity-accused-of-scraping-websites-that-explicitly-blocked-ai-scraping/\">previously</a> denied to TechCrunch that the bots were the company’s and called Cloudflare’s blog post a sales pitch for Cloudflare. Then on Tuesday, Perplexity <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/agents-or-bots-making-sense-of-ai-on-the-open-web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published a blog</a> in its defense (and generally attacking Cloudflare), claiming the behavior was from a third-party service it uses occasionally.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the crux of Perplexity’s post made a similar appeal as its online defenders did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The difference between automated crawling and user-driven fetching isn’t just technical — it’s about who gets to access information on the open web,” the post said. “This controversy reveals that Cloudflare’s systems are fundamentally inadequate for distinguishing between legitimate AI assistants and actual threats.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity’s accusations aren’t exactly fair, either. One argument that Prince and Cloudflare used for calling out Perplexity’s methods was that OpenAI doesn’t behave in the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI is an example of a leading AI company that follows these best practices,” <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cloudflare wrote</a>. “They respect robots.txt and do not try to evade either a robots.txt directive or a network level block. And ChatGPT Agent is signing http requests using the newly proposed open standard Web Bot Auth.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/web-bot-auth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Web Bot Auth</a> is a Cloudflare-supported standard being developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force that hopes to create a cryptographic method for identifying AI agent web requests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The debate comes as bot activity reshapes the internet. As TechCrunch has previously reported, bots seeking to scrape massive amounts of content to train AI models <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/open-source-devs-are-fighting-ai-crawlers-with-cleverness-and-vengeance/\">have become a menace</a>, especially to smaller sites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the first time in the internet’s history, <a href=\"https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/2025-bad-bot-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bot activity is currently outstripping human activity online</a>, with AI traffic accounting for over 50%, according to Imperva’s Bad Bot report released last month. Most of that activity is coming from LLMs. But the report also found that malicious bots now make up 37% of all internet traffic. That’s activity that includes everything from persistent scraping to unauthorized login attempts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until LLMs, the internet generally accepted that websites could and should block most bot activity given how often it was malicious by using CAPTCHAs and other services (such as Cloudflare). Websites also had a clear incentive to work with specific good actors, such as Googlebot, guiding it on what not to index through robots.txt. Google indexed the internet, which sent traffic to sites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, LLMs are eating an increasing amount of that traffic. Gartner predicts <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">that search engine volume</a> will drop by 25% by 2026. Right now humans tend to click website links from LLMs at the point they are most valuable to the website, which is when they are ready to conduct a transaction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if humans <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/what-exactly-is-an-ai-agent/\">adopt agents</a> as the tech industry predicts they will — to arrange our travel, book our dinner reservations, and shop for us — would websites hurt their business interests by blocking them? The debate on X captured the dilemma perfectly:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I WANT perplexity to visit any public content on my behalf when I give it a request/task!” wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/denisandrejew/status/1952384393147736294\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one person</a> in response to Cloudflare calling out Perplexity. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/denisandrejew/status/1952384393147736294\"><br><br></a>“What if the site owners don’t want it? they just want you [to] directly visit the home, see their stuff” <a href=\"https://x.com/khanhicetea/status/1952387322332471658\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">argued another</a>, pointing out that the site owner who created the content wants the traffic and potential ad revenue, not to let Perplexity take it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is why I can’t see ‘agentic browsing’ really working — much harder problem than people think. Most website owners will just block,” <a href=\"https://x.com/jwblackwell/status/1952384112364548402\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a third</a> predicted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It applies to companies both local and foreign, and it can affect both providers and deployers of AI systems; the European Commission cites examples of how it would apply to a developer of a CV screening tool and to a bank that buys that tool. Now all of these parties have a legal framework that sets the stage for their use of AI.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-does-the-eu-ai-act-exist\">Why does the EU AI Act exist?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As usual with EU legislation, the EU AI Act exists to make sure there is a uniform legal framework applying to a certain topic across EU countries — the topic this time being AI. Now that the regulation is in place, it should “ensure the free movement, cross-border, of AI-based goods and services” without diverging local restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With timely regulation, the EU seeks to create a level playing field across the region and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/\">foster trust</a>, which could also create opportunities for emerging companies. However, the common framework that it has adopted is not exactly permissive: Despite the relatively early stage of widespread AI adoption in most sectors, the EU AI Act sets a high bar for what AI should and shouldn’t do for society more broadly.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-the-purpose-of-the-eu-ai-act\">What is the purpose of the EU AI Act?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to European lawmakers, the framework’s main goal is to “promote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy AI while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI systems in the Union, and to support innovation.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, that’s quite a mouthful, but it’s worth parsing carefully. First, because a lot will depend on how you define “human centric” and “trustworthy” AI. And second, because it gives a good sense of the precarious balance to maintain between diverging goals: innovation vs. harm prevention, as well as uptake of AI vs. environmental protection. As usual with EU legislation, again, the devil will be in the details.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-does-the-eu-ai-act-balance-its-different-goals\">How does the EU AI Act balance its different goals?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To balance harm prevention against the potential benefits of AI, the EU AI Act adopted a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/eu-council-gives-final-nod-to-set-up-risk-based-regulations-for-ai/\">risk-based approach</a>: banning a handful of “unacceptable risk” use cases; flagging a set of “high-risk” uses calling for tight regulation; and applying lighter obligations to “limited risk” scenarios.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-has-the-eu-ai-act-come-into-effect\">Has the EU AI Act come into effect?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes and no. The EU AI Act rollout started on August 1, 2024, but it will only come into force through a series of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/eus-ai-act-gets-published-in-blocs-official-journal-starting-clock-on-legal-deadlines/\">staggered compliance deadlines</a>. In most cases, it will also apply sooner to new entrants than to companies that already offer AI products and services in the EU.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first deadline came into effect on February 2, 2025, and focused on enforcing bans on a small number of prohibited uses of AI, such as untargeted scraping of internet or CCTV for facial images to build up or expand databases. Many others will follow, but unless the schedule changes, most provisions will apply by mid-2026.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-changed-on-august-2-2025\">What changed on August 2, 2025?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since August 2, 2025, the EU AI Act applies to “general-purpose AI models with systemic risk.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPAI (general-purpose AI) models are AI models trained with a large amount of data, and that can be used for a wide range of tasks. That’s where the risk element comes in. According to the EU AI Act, GPAI models can come with <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/faqs/general-purpose-ai-models-ai-act-questions-answers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">systemic risks</a> —  “for example, through the lowering of barriers for chemical or biological weapons development, or unintended issues of control over autonomous [GPAI] models.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahead of the deadline, the EU published <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/learn-more-about-guidelines-providers-general-purpose-ai-models\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">guidelines</a> for providers of GPAI models, which include both European companies and non-European players such as Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI. But since these companies already have models on the market, they will also have until August 2, 2027, to comply, unlike new entrants.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-the-eu-ai-act-have-teeth\">Does the EU AI Act have teeth?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EU AI Act comes with penalties that lawmakers wanted to be simultaneously “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” — even for large global players.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Details will be laid down by EU countries, but the regulation sets out the overall spirit — that penalties will vary depending on the deemed risk level — as well as thresholds for each level. Infringement on prohibited AI applications leads to the highest penalty of “up to €35 million or 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The European Commission can also inflict fines of up to €15 million or 3% of annual turnover on providers of GPAI models. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-fast-do-existing-players-intend-to-comply\">How fast do existing players intend to comply?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">voluntary GPAI code of practice</a>, including commitments such as not training models on pirated content, is a good indicator of how companies may engage with the framework law until forced to do so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July 2025, Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/meta-refuses-to-sign-eus-ai-code-of-practice/\">announced it wouldn’t sign</a> the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">voluntary GPAI code of practice</a> meant to help such providers comply with the EU AI Act. However, Google soon after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/google-says-it-will-sign-eus-ai-code-of-practice/\">confirmed it would sign</a>, despite reservations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai#ecl-inpage-Signatories-of-the-AI-Pact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Signatories</a> so far include Aleph Alpha, Amazon, Anthropic, Cohere, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and OpenAI, among others. But as we have seen with Google’s example, signing does not equal a full-on endorsement.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-have-some-tech-companies-been-fighting-these-rules-nbsp\">Why have (some) tech companies been fighting these rules? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While stating in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/eu-ai-code-practice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> that Google would sign the voluntary GPAI code of practice, its president of global affairs, Kent Walker, still had reservations. “We remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing Europe’s development and deployment of AI,” he wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta was more radical, with its chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan stating in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joel-kaplan-63905618_europe-is-heading-down-the-wrong-path-on-activity-7351928745668055042-XuF7/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> on LinkedIn that “Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI.” Calling the EU’s implementation of the AI Act “overreach,” he stated that the code of practice “introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">European companies have expressed concerns as well. Arthur Mensch, the CEO of French AI champion Mistral AI, was part of a group of European CEOs who <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/top-european-ceos-plead-for-pause-in-ai-act/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed an open letter</a> in July 2025 urging Brussels to <a href=\"https://aichampions.eu/#stoptheclock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“stop the clock”</a> for two years before key obligations of the EU AI Act came into force.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-will-the-schedule-change\">Will the schedule change?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early July 2025, the European Union responded negatively to lobbying efforts calling for a pause, saying it would still stick to its timeline for implementing the EU AI Act. It went ahead with the August 2, 2025, deadline as planned, and we will update this story if anything changes.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The safety overview will include key information about the group, alongside tips to stay safe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, you will see if the person who added you is one of your contacts, and if any member of the group is a contact of yours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you decide that you might recognize the group, you can choose to see the chat for more context.

The scammers attempted to build trust in their scheme by sharing how much the target has already ‘earned’ in theory, before asking them to deposit money into a crypto account as the next task.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp says users can protect themselves from scams by taking time before responding to think about whether the message reads like a legitimate task. They should then question if the request makes sense and if they’re rushing you into taking action. If they’re claiming to be a friend or family member, you should use another method of communication to verify their identity.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The model also features “promptable world events,” or the ability to use a prompt to change the generated world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps most importantly, Genie 3’s simulations stay physically consistent over time because the model can remember what it previously generated — a capability that DeepMind says its researchers didn’t explicitly program into the model. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fruchter said that while Genie 3 has implications for educational experiences, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/could-googles-veo-3-be-the-start-of-playable-world-models/\">gaming</a> or prototyping creative concepts, its real unlock will manifest in training agents for general-purpose tasks, which he said is essential to reaching AGI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think world models are key on the path to AGI, specifically for embodied agents, where simulating real world scenarios is particularly challenging,” Jack Parker-Holder, a research scientist on DeepMind’s open-endedness team, said during the briefing.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prompt-to-World.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034136\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google DeepMind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Genie 3 is supposedly designed to solve that bottleneck. Like Veo, it doesn’t rely on a hard-coded physics engine; instead, DeepMind says, the model teaches itself how the world works — how objects move, fall, and interact — by remembering what it has generated and reasoning over long time horizons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The model is auto-regressive, meaning it generates one frame at a time,” Fruchter told TechCrunch in an interview. “It has to look back at what was generated before to decide what’s going to happen next. That’s a key part of the architecture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That memory, the company says, lends to consistency in Genie 3’s simulated worlds, which in turn allows it to develop a grasp of physics, similar to how humans understand that a glass teetering on the edge of a table is about to fall, or that they should duck to avoid a falling object.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, DeepMind says the model also has the potential to push AI agents to their limits — forcing them to learn from their own experience, similar to how humans learn in the real world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an example, DeepMind shared its test of Genie 3 with a recent version of its generalist <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent (SIMA)</a>, instructing it to pursue a set of goals. In a warehouse setting, they asked the agent to perform tasks like “approach the bright green trash compactor” or “walk to the packed red forklift.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In all three cases, the SIMA agent is able to achieve the goal,” Parker-Holder said. “It just receives the actions from the agent. So the agent takes the goal, sees the world simulated around it, and then takes the actions in the world. Genie 3 simulates forward, and the fact that it’s able to achieve it is because Genie 3 remains consistent.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prompt-Event.gif?w=480\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034137\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google DeepMind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Genie 3 has its limitations. For example, while the researchers claim it can understand physics, the demo showing a skier barreling down a mountain didn’t reflect how snow would move in relation to the skier. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the range of actions an agent can take is limited. For example, the promptable world events allow for a wide range of environmental interventions, but they’re not necessarily performed by the agent itself. And it’s still difficult to accurately model complex interactions between multiple independent agents in a shared environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Genie 3 can also only support a few minutes of continuous interaction, when hours would be necessary for proper training. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the model presents a compelling step forward in teaching agents to go beyond reacting to inputs, letting them potentially plan, explore, seek out uncertainty, and improve through trial and error — the kind of self-driven, embodied learning that many say is key to moving toward general intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We haven’t really had a Move 37 moment for embodied agents yet, where they can actually take novel actions in the real world,” Parker-Holder said, referring to the legendary moment in the 2016 game of Go between DeepMind’s AI agent AlphaGo and world champion Lee Sedol, in which Alpha Go played an unconventional and brilliant move that became symbolic of AI’s ability to discover new strategies beyond human understanding. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But now, we can potentially usher in a new era,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company on Tuesday announced the launch of its $11.99 per month Audiobooks+ plan in the market, which allows subscribers or their household members on a Family or Duo plan to add 15 hours of audiobook listening during the month on top of the base plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Spotify <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/spotify-brings-audiobooks-to-u-s-users-with-a-catalog-of-300000-titles-to-start/\">launched</a> its audiobooks service in the U.S. back in 2022, household members on Duo and Family plans have long been left out. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The offering makes audiobooks available to household members for the first time in the U.S. market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through Spotify Premium, subscribers already have access to 15 hours of audiobook listening per month and can buy additional hours to top off that, as needed. However, the Audiobooks+ plan gives subscribers the option to add recurring access to 15 additional hours every month, on top of the Premium plan’s existing monthly allotment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While that may be overkill for any but the more voracious audiobook listeners, the U.S. rollout of Audiobooks+ also means that other members on a subscription plan besides the cardholder can now also access Spotify’s audiobooks catalog for the first time. This is made possible through the add-on called “Audiobooks+ for Plan Members.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the launch, the U.S. joins a handful of other markets with access to Audiobooks+, including Ireland, Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg\" alt=\"a photo containing three screenshots of the Audiobooks+ feature in Spotify on iOS.\" class=\"wp-image-3034106\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1200,683 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1280,729 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=430,245 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=720,410 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=900,513 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=800,456 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1536,875 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=668,380 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=659,375 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1084,617 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=708,403 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement of the plan’s expansion to the U.S. comes shortly after a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/spotify-spot-stock-q2-2025-earnings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tough quarter</a> for the streaming giant, where it missed expectations and reported weak guidance. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek pointed to a weaker ads business as the cause. (Spotify’s ads chief had just left for DoorDash, media outlets reported ahead of earnings.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the loss, one bright spot for the company in the quarter was its user growth. Active users grew 11% to 696 million, and paid subscribers grew 12% to 276 million during the second quarter. The goal with the new Audiobooks+ plan is to extract more money from those existing customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, publisher HarperCollins teased a solution for the problem with household members’ inability to access audiobooks. HarperCollins CEO Brian Murray said at the time that Spotify was working to adjust a “technical problem” with family plans that limited audiobook streaming only to the family plan’s credit card holder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, Spotify made good on that promise when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/spotify-expands-audiobook-access-to-family-plan-members-for-the-first-time/\">expanded</a> audiobook access to plan members for the first time with the launch of Audiobooks+ in several non-U.S. markets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify doesn’t share how many of its Premium subscribers stream audiobooks in addition to music or podcasts, but notes that audiobook listening hours are up more than 35% year-over-year in the U.S., U.K., and Australia. Notably, that’s before these add-on plans became available. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news of the new subscription follows Spotify’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/spotify-raises-subscription-prices/\">announcement</a> on Monday that its subscription prices are increasing from €10,99 to €11,99 across markets in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify says it will experiment with other options for book fans in the future, including direct sales.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said it is “actively investigating these incidents to determine whether they are connected to a previously disclosed vulnerability or if a new vulnerability may be responsible.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s alert comes as security researchers say they have identified hackers targeting SonicWall devices to gain initial access to a victim’s network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hackers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/a-brief-history-of-mass-hacks/\">increasingly targeting enterprise products</a>, like firewalls and VPNs, which work as digital gatekeepers, allowing legitimate employees access to the company’s network.

The company said “available evidence points to the existence of a zero-day vulnerability,” referring to a security bug that was discovered and exploited before the vendor could patch the issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers said they witnessed a short gap between the exploitation of the SonicWall firewall and the subsequent deployment of file-encrypting malware, or ransomware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huntress Labs, another cybersecurity firm, said it <a href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/exploitation-of-sonicwall-vpn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is “likely” that a zero-day bug in SonicWall firewalls is to blame</a> for the attacks, and warned that the hackers exploiting the bug have been seen gaining access to a company’s domain controllers, which manages the devices and users on that network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its blog, Huntress said it believes the Akira ransomware gang is behind some of the attacks targeting SonicWall customers. Akira has been known to target enterprise products, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/hackers-are-exploiting-a-new-fortinet-firewall-bug-to-breach-company-networks/\">like Fortinet firewalls</a>, to break into large networks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a critical, ongoing threat,” wrote Huntress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
