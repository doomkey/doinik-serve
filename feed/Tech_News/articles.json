Etsy says the deal will allow it to focus on its own marketplace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal comes nearly five years after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal/\">Etsy acquired Depop</a> for $1.62 billion, at a time when secondhand clothing apps were <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/fashion-resale-brands-have-lasting-power-beyond-2020-pandemic-induced-boom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">gaining in popularity</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2011, Depop generated approximately $1 billion in gross merchandise sales — the total value of goods sold through its platform — in 2025. In the U.S., the company saw nearly 60% year-over-year growth. As of December 31, 2025, the marketplace had seven million active buyers, nearly 90% of whom were under 34, and more than three million active sellers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Depop has built a trusted, social-forward marketplace with strong momentum in the pre-loved fashion category, and we are confident that as part of eBay, Depop will be even more well-positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from our scale, complementary offerings, and operational capabilities,” said eBay CEO Jamie Iannone in the <a href=\"https://investors.etsy.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/217/ebay-to-acquire-depop-from-etsy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as Etsy has struggled to grow its business after the pandemic-era e-commerce boom, competing with marketplaces like Temu and Shein, as well as Amazon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s year-over-year revenue grew 2.2% in 2024, down from 7.1% growth reported in 2023. Etsy is scheduled to release its 2025 earnings on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are excited that this transaction allows us to focus exclusively on the compelling opportunity we see in front of us: to grow the Etsy marketplace in ways that matter most to our buyers and sellers,” said Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal in the press release. “We are proud of what the Depop team has built – a truly differentiated brand and product, grounded in clear purpose and strong community – becoming one of the fastest-growing fashion resale marketplaces in the U.S. I am confident that Depop is well-positioned for its next phase of growth as part of eBay.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sale is the latest in a pattern of Etsy acquiring and then divesting niche online marketplaces. Etsy’s sale of Depop comes as the company has purchased and then sold other niche online marketplaces in recent years, including Brazilian e-commerce company Elo7 and musical instrument marketplace Reverb.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Germ’s standalone app is also available in a public beta on iOS in North America and Europe. That app had seen thousands of downloads so far, but after the official integration announcement, daily active users jumped by 5x, the team said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">California-based Germ is a startup founded by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tessa-r-brown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tessa Brown</a>, a communications scholar who previously taught at Stanford, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmxue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mark Xue</a>, who worked as a privacy engineer at Apple on technologies like FaceTime and iMessage. The idea, the company previously explained to TechCrunch, was to offer an alternative to other E2E encrypted platforms like iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp that’s built on newer technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Germ takes advantage of Messaging Layer Security (MLS), a new standard approved by the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF), and the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol</a> (or ATProto), which powers Bluesky, Skylight, and a growing number of other social apps. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of requiring a user’s phone number, Germ integrates with ATProto to enable its encrypted chats. That means Germ’s messages cannot be decrypted by another service, including itself or Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the new messenger, you’ll simply click on the badge on a friend’s profile on Bluesky, which opens an iOS App Clip — a lightweight, temporary app. You click “open” on this app experience and then authenticate by logging in with your ATProto handle. You can then send a message to a friend immediately.

Now, users who set up Germ to work within Bluesky will receive a new badge that’s displayed on their profiles, allowing them to remove the link-in-bio option they were using before. (The links will still work, but the badge is easier and more noticeable, of course.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Germ told TechCrunch their startup has been in conversation with the ATProto developer community, including Bluesky’s app and protocol teams, since the <a href=\"https://atprotocol.dev/atmosphereconf-seattle-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ATmosphere Conference in Seattle</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve been transparent about our planning and roadmap, and shipping our private beta in August generated valuable feedback from users and developers about the desire to replace our links in bios with native UI,” said Xue, who serves as CTO at Germ Network. “Both our team and Bluesky’s saw value in better AppView support for the Germ link.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes to Bluesky’s app were led by head of product Alex Benzer, as the company was <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/protocol-checkin-fall-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">looked to experiment</a> with implementing third-party services within Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Working directly with the Bluesky team has been a treat,” Brown, Germ’s CEO, told TechCrunch. “They ship fast, prioritize the user experience, and care about their users’ access to end-to-end encrypted messaging. We’re thrilled to be the first secure messenger they’ve brought natively into their app.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s true that the AT Protocol could eventually implement E2E encryption, that is not a focus today. As Bluesky protocol engineer Daniel Holms recently explained, the company has several reasons not to design a system itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reality is that E2EE is hard,” he <a href=\"https://dholms.leaflet.pub/3meluqcwky22a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a blog post</a>. “And this inherent complexity isn’t something that the protocol team at Bluesky can just handle – it gets pushed out to every dev trying to build a client that works with encrypted data,” Holms said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xue agreed, adding, “We align with the ATProto ethos that people should be able to communicate using the apps and tools they choose. We believe that by solving the hard problems for ATProto users in safe, transparent, and user-friendly ways, they’ll continue to choose us,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after Bluesky added support for the Germ badge, another <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/blackskyweb.xyz/post/3meoxfu7ap22m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol-based client, Blacksky</a>, did as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown noted the team is currently focused on shipping more everyday messaging features, not on monetization. But further down the road, Germ may test paid features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect that our first paid features will be centered on the needs of prosumer power users like creators, journalists, and politicians—for example, support for multiple handles and private AI-powered screening for first messages from new connections,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Specifically, it covers SeatGeek’s 15 major U.S. venue partners, including State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Nissan Stadium in Nashville, and AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington. (So, although SeatGeek is a major player in the secondary ticketing space, this integration is exclusive to venues where it operates as the primary ticketing platform.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a strategic win for SeatGeek.

At the time, the company was testing the robots at a facility in South Carolina and said it took Amazon <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/new-robots-amazon-fulfillment-agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">significantly less time to develop Blue Jay</a> — only about a year— than it did to develop its other warehouse robots, a speed the company credited to advancements in AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon spokesperson Terrence Clark told TechCrunch that Blue Jay was launched as a prototype — although that was not made clear in the company’s original press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use Blue Jay’s core technology for other robotics “manipulation programs” with employees who worked on Blue Jay being moved to other projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark told TechCrunch over email. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also unveiled the Vulcan robot last year, which is used in the storage compartments of the company’s warehouses. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/amazon-debuts-a-warehouse-robot-with-a-sense-of-touch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vulcan is a two-armed robot</a>, with one arm meant to rearrange and move items in a compartment while the other is equipped with a camera and suction cups to grab goods.

The post outlines the app’s future direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app, which is part of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the fediverse</a> — a larger, decentralized social web operating on the ActivityPub protocol — was thrust back into the spotlight when Elon Musk acquired Twitter, now called X, in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">October 2022</a>. Since then, it has seen occasional growth spurts but has often struggled to retain new users due to its more complicated setup. On Mastodon, you don’t simply create an account with a username and password; you also have to pick a server to join — an additional step that often confuses those new to decentralization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Mastodon sees somewhere between 750,000 and 1 million monthly active users, depending on the source. One <a href=\"https://mastodon.fediverse.observer/stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">third-party tracker</a> puts the figure closer to 750,000, while another estimates as many as <a href=\"https://fedidb.com/software/mastodon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1 million</a>. <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mastodon’s own site</a> says the figure is around 785,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of its coming updates, the organization says it will try to make this onboarding process more understandable, while also promoting smaller servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To date, new users have often defaulted to picking the largest servers, but that undermines the power of a decentralized web. As the blog post notes, “Mastodon is best when communities are spread across many independent servers, each with its own character and focus.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New admin tools will help indie server operators handle maintenance and moderation duties more easily, including a feature to use external blocklists. The organization will also offer ways to set up content scanning for detecting illegal content and spam, along with other tools to reduce media storage usage by serving remote media posts through a trusted third party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Mastodon will look to bring on more content creators, including public figures, journalists, and institutions, with a series of updates to its app. To do so, it’s introducing a redesigned user profile that lets individuals showcase their work as well as an enhanced compose experience. Also in the works is a new email notification option that would allow someone to follow their updates, even if they don’t yet have a Mastodon account. That could appeal to those who want to follow newsletter writers, reporters, thought leaders, and other creators, while allowing those creators to reach a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes follow the rollout of other new features in recent months, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/mastodon-rolls-out-quote-posts-with-protections-to-prevent-dunking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Quote Posts</a>, similar to the feature on X and others, but with more user controls, and plans for its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/mastodon-is-taking-cues-from-bluesky-with-plans-for-its-own-starter-packs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">own take on Starter Pack-style user recommendations</a>, called <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/featured_collections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Collections</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updates follow a shift in leadership at Mastodon: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\">founder </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eugen Rochko </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\">stepped down as CEO</a> after the platform announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/mastodon-announces-transition-to-nonprofit-structure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transition to a nonprofit structure</a> at the beginning of the year.

However, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/fei-fei-li-s-ai-startup-world-labs-in-funding-talks-at-5-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> a month ago suggested it was aiming to raise at a $5 billion valuation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership between World Labs and Autodesk will see the two companies collaborating to explore how World Labs’ models — AI systems that can generate and reason about immersive 3D environments — can work alongside Autodesk’s tools, and vice versa, starting with a focus on entertainment use cases. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For World Labs, Autodesk’s investment is a signal that its product has commercial appeal. The startup’s first world model product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Marble</a>, released last November, lets users create editable, downloadable 3D environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk is one of the biggest developers of 3D CAD (computer-aided design) software. Its platform underpins architectural, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and entertainment workflows. That focus on the built world makes investment in advanced spatial AI a natural extension of its core business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or as Li put it in a statement: “Autodesk has long helped people think spatially and solve real-world problems and, together, we share a clear purpose: building physical AI that augments human creativity and puts more powerful tools in the hands of designers, builders, and creators.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, Autodesk will serve as an adviser to World Labs, and the two will collaborate at the “research and model level.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daron Green, Autodesk’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch the partnership is still in its early days, so the precise form it’s going to take hasn’t been determined yet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You could anticipate us consuming their models or them consuming our models in different settings,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He mused that customers might like to start with a world-model-based sketch in World Labs (say, of an office layout) and then drill down on certain design aspects (like the design of the desk), which is where Autodesk’s tech might come in. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Similarly, you might want to take an object that you’ve designed in our [platform], and put it in a context that you create through one of [World Labs’] prompts,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green added that data sharing is not part of the agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green said the two companies plan to start with media and entertainment use cases. Most companies building world models — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/i-built-marshmallow-castles-in-googles-new-ai-world-generator-project-genie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google DeepMind</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/\">Runway</a> — see gaming and interactive entertainment as an initial go-to-market strategy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk already works with most major media production companies and has been training models for character animation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are close to world models,” Green said. “They’re a characterization of an animal in the world that’s responding to physical constraints like time, maybe a terrain it needs to traverse. So there’s a physical understanding in the model, and you can see how that might be combined [with World Labs’ tech]. You’re not just animating the dog, but you’re giving it a world within which it can now interact.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership with World Labs supports Autodesk’s broader push to integrate more AI features across its software portfolio. The company is developing <a href=\"https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/news/upcoming-3d-generative-ai-foundation-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“neural CAD,”</a> a new kind of generative AI model trained on geometric data that can reason about components and entire systems. Put simply, it can generate working 3D models, not just images, with an understanding of how those designs would function in the real world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk’s neural CAD models are already being integrated into the firm’s product design and architecture products as a step toward more advanced spatial intelligence. But World Labs’ models could help extend that capability beyond individual design files toward more holistic digital representations of the physical world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green thinks different AI systems, including large language models, world models, and neural CAD will be combined in the future to improve designs for Autodesk’s customers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If AI is to be truly useful, it must understand worlds, not just words,” Li said in the statement. “Worlds are governed by geometry, physics, and dynamics, and reconciling the semantic, spatial, and physical is the next great frontier of AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to include more details on World Labs’ raise.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The smartphone is available for preorder now with shipments starting March 5.  It comes in Lavender, Berry, Fog, and Obsidian.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel 10a features a completely flat back, which means the camera bar blends with the back of the phone and lies flat when you place it down on a surface.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google notes that the smartphone’s 6.3-inch Actua display is 11% brighter than the Pixel 9a. It also has faster charging than its predecessor, with more than 30 hours of battery life and up to 120 hours with the “Extreme Battery Saver” setting turned on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel 10a comes with the same Tensor G4 chip that powered last year’s Pixel 9a.

The feature also lets users switch between the different formats across devices. While in the “Read &amp; Listen” mode, the text of the book is highlighted in real time in sync with the narration.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Kindle app <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/narrationhelp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">already offered a tool </a>that would allow readers to move between the Audible version and the e-book, when both versions had been purchased. This feature is now coming to Audible’s app for the first time. Customers will need to own both versions of the book for this to work, but discounted audiobooks will be made available to customers who own the matching e-book, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, hundreds of thousands of titles will be supported by the new “Read &amp; Listen” feature, including those in English, German, Spanish, Italian, and French. Initially, the option will be offered in the U.S., with the U.K., Australia, and Germany gaining support over the next few months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To discover eligible titles, Audible will automatically identify which Kindle e-books have audiobook matches within its app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, many customers were already reading and listening to their books without buying two versions — by having Alexa narrate their e-books from their Kindle library. Alexa is not a professional narrator by any means, and the AI assistant’s more monotonous delivery can lead you to zone out. By offering a way to add on the audiobook for a lower price when you’ve already bought the e-book, Amazon hopes to boost book sales across formats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also claims that the combination of reading and listening can improve focus and comprehension, according to industry research and its own internal data. In addition, customers who read and listen are the most engaged, consuming nearly twice as much content per month as audiobook-only customers, Audible noted. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature may make sense for students and those learning a new language, as well as those who are trying to get through more books quickly. It’s also useful for those who regularly switch back and forth between reading and listening, and those who want the experience of the narration — particularly if a book is read by a favorite voice actor. Plus, some may simply appreciate having a narrator introduce all the characters by name, so they can learn the pronunciation without having to guess (a particularly thorny issue in fantasy novels!).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Audiobooks count as reading,” said Andy Tsao, chief product officer at Audible, in a statement about the launch. “But now at Audible, you can read with your eyes too. Read &amp; Listen gives book lovers the best of both worlds. Whether you’re learning a new language, studying for school, or lost in a story’s world, you no longer have to choose one format over the other.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon notes that the new feature will not impact publishers’ royalty payments. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This approach mirrors broader industry trends, with vertical videos dominating platforms such as TikTok and Instagram Reels.

Annualized revenue refers to a business’s current revenue rate projected over a full year. The social media giant says the milestone is driven by its Snapchat+ offering, which has now surpassed 25 million subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in 2022, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month/\">Snapchat+</a> gives subscribers access to exclusive and pre-release features for $3.99 per month. Following a successful launch, Snap introduced additional paid tiers beyond the core Snapchat+ subscription over the past year to further diversify its revenue streams.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Snapchat+ has become one of the fastest-growing consumer subscription services globally, with subscriber growth every quarter,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/snap-1b-direct-revenue-25m-subscription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “What started as an early-access program for our most engaged Snapchatters has quickly scaled into a meaningful business—one that now represents a strong and growing revenue stream alongside our ads business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last June, Snapchat launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/snapchat-rolls-out-a-new-8-99-lens-subscription-tier/\">Lens+</a>, which gives users access to exclusive Lenses and AR experiences, along with the perks in the standard Snapchat+ tier, for $8.99 per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early 2025, the company launched an ad-free Snapchat+ subscription tier called Platinum for $15.99 per month. And, in a controversial move in September, Snapchat announced plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/snapchat-caps-free-memory-storage-launches-paid-storage-plans/\">cap free storage for its Memories feature</a> and launched a paid storage plan that costs $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ subscribers will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moving beyond Snapchat+, the company announced yesterday that it’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/snapchat-launches-creator-subscription-in-the-u-s/\">launching creator subscriptions</a> in alpha with select people in the U.S. Users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscriptions, which will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator’s public Stories, and an ad-free experience for that creator’s Stories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of the future, Snap says it’s going to continue to grow Snapchat+ with a focus on customization and community-driven features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/meta-to-test-premium-subscriptions-on-instagram-facebook-and-whatsapp/\">rival Meta is following suit</a>, as the company told TechCrunch last month that it was going to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, you could ask Gemini to create a “comical R&amp;B slow jam about a sock finding its match,” and the app will generate a 30-second track along with cover art made by Nano Banana.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said that you can even upload a photo or a video, and the AI-powered tool will create a song to match the mood of the media file.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that Lyria 3 improves on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3009803/google-expands-access-to-its-lyria-music-generating-models/\">the previous generation of models</a>, creating more realistic and complex music tracks. Users can also change and control other elements like style, vocals, and tempo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with rolling out Lyria 3 to the Gemini app, Google is making the model available to YouTube creators through the Dream Track feature on YouTube, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14151606?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a tool</a> that helps creators make AI-generated tracks. The option was only available to YouTube creators in the U.S. until now. But with this release, Google is expanding Dream Track availability globally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said that you can’t mimic an artist outright, but if you add an artist’s name to your prompt, Gemini will create a track in a similar style or a mood. (It’s not clear if generation will make it easier for others to decode the music style of a particular artist.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Music generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content,” the company said in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/lyria-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google noted that all songs created with the Lyria 3 model will have a SynthID watermark to identify AI-generated content. The company said that it’s also <a href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16722517?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">adding capabilities to identify AI-generated music</a> with SynthID within Gemini. Users will be able to upload tracks and ask Gemini if it is AI-generated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Music generation is rolling out to all 18+ Gemini users across the world with support for English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-generated music has created mixed sentiments among artists and listeners. On one hand, companies like YouTube and Spotify are adopting AI and signing contracts with music labels to monetize AI-generated music. On the other hand, AI model and tooling companies are facing lawsuits from the music industry over copyrights of the training material. Platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/deezer-makes-it-easier-for-rival-platforms-to-take-a-stance-against-ai-generated-music/\">Deezer have published tools to mark AI-generated music</a> to curb fraudulent streams of this kind of music.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marketing is one of the few operations no industry can afford to ignore, which is why we have a veritable host of AI-powered marketing tools being shoved into marketers’ faces today. All the social platforms, from Facebook and Instagram to TikTok, and major incumbents like Microsoft and Google, to content-generation startups like Jasper and Copy.ai, offer AI tools that claim to make marketers’ lives easier in uncountable ways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That was partly why I was confused to see yet another marketing AI startup entering the fray: San Francisco-based Kana just came out of stealth with a suite of AI agents that can do data analysis, audience targeting, campaign management, customer engagement, media planning, and optimizing for AI chatbots. The startup has raised $15 million in a seed funding round led by Mayfield. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Kana has something going for it that most marketing startups today don’t: Its co-founders, Tom Chavez (CEO; pictured above on the right) and Vivek Vaidya (CTO; pictured above on the left), have been building marketing tech for more than 25 years. Kana’s actually their fourth venture after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2008/03/14/microsoft-picks-up-another-ad-startup-rapt/\">Rapt</a> (acquired by Microsoft in 2008), <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/to-beef-up-in-marketing-tech-salesforce-is-buying-krux-for-340m-in-cash-and-stock-potentially-750m-overall/\">Krux</a> (bought by Salesforce in 2016), and startup studio <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/28/superset-startup-studio-fundraise/\">super{set}</a>, which they incubated Kana in for nine months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling this a “wondrous” time to be building, Chavez said there was a clear opportunity to bring their experience and today’s AI tech to bear on this class of problems. “We see a market that’s crying out for solutions that meet this moment […] We understand the space deeply, having wallowed in it arguably a little too long; having really stood in our customers’ pain,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The solution, as Kana pitches it, involves “loosely coupled” AI agents that can be tailored “on the fly,” integrated into legacy marketing software, and can simultaneously work on different operations. So a marketer could, for example, upload a media brief that Kana’s agents would analyze to figure out the campaign goals, search for the audience to target, and pull in data from inventory and market research to further tweak the plan. The platform bakes in autonomous campaign tracking, optimization, and reporting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside agents, Kana offers synthetic data generation to augment third-party data sources for activities like market research and audience targeting. This, Chavez argued, could help companies reduce the costs of using third-party data, fill in gaps in the data, and help marketers run tests on various platforms faster and narrow down strategies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kana says this is all done while keeping humans in the loop so that marketers can approve the AI agents’ actions, give feedback, and customize what the agents do as their needs change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chavez and Vaidya emphasized the importance of the platform’s flexibility, arguing that the ability to deploy, tailor, and build new agents in real time would let marketers see results on their campaigns faster than they would with legacy systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Going forward, the startup sees that very flexibility to customize its platform for customers, doubling as its moat against incumbents and other startups building similar products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have the opportunity not to create bespoke solutions, but to highly tailor and configure these solutions to meet customers where they are. Larger companies just are never going to get there,” Chavez said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We live in a world which allows us to explore a third option [with customers]: not build, not buy, but build with — build with in a way which is supported,” Vaidya added. “We can move with insane speed that these big companies just cannot. And that’s our advantage.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kana will use the fresh cash to expand hiring across engineering, product, and go-to-market. Mayfield managing partner Navin Chaddha is joining the company’s board. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As non-humans — chatbots, AI agents, and automated systems — have proliferated on the web, so has the need to provide them with credentials, permissions, and identities. That’s one major reason identity and access management startups that help manage this new kind of digital workforce are raking in venture capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, a 35-person Israeli-American startup called Venice is emerging from stealth with fresh cash and a plucky claim: that it’s already replacing industry stalwarts like CyberArk and Okta at Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venice, founded just over two years ago, says it raised $20 million in Series A funding in December, led by IVP, with participation from Index Ventures, which led its earlier seed round. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike many of its well-funded rivals — which include Persona (raised a <a href=\"https://withpersona.com/blog/series-d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$200 million</a> Series D last April), Veza (closed a <a href=\"https://veza.com/company/press-room/series-d-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$108 million</a> Series D last May), and GitGuardian SAS (raised <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/gitguardian-raises-50-million-for-secrets-and-non-human-identity-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$50 million</a> last week) — Venice is tackling both cloud-based and on-premises environments, a technical choice that has made the product harder to build but positioned it to win over the large enterprises still running legacy systems alongside modern cloud infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its helm sits 31-year-old Rotem Lurie, whose path to entrepreneurship pretty much ticks every box on VCs’ checklists. The daughter of two programmer parents in Israel (her mother was one of the country’s first female software engineers), Lurie spent four-and-a-half years as a lieutenant in Unit 8200, Israel’s elite intelligence corps, before joining Microsoft as a product manager working on what would become Defender for Identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She later became the first product hire at Axis Security, an access management startup that sold to Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $500 million in 2022. Just before that acquisition closed, Lurie left to join YL Ventures, a cybersecurity-focused venture firm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That brief stint at YL Ventures proved particularly instructive. “Every day, I used to meet a team of three 23-year-old boys,” Lurie says straightforwardly over a Zoom call. “Most of those companies build their technology to be acquired. The entire strategy around what problem you’re solving and how you penetrate the market — it’s a completely different approach.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To replace incumbents like CyberArk, which has long dominated the privileged access management market, Lurie realized she’d need to play a longer game. That meant building technology that’s both deep and comprehensive enough to support the complex, hybrid IT environments of most large enterprises. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The technical challenge ahead of Lurie went thus: Most identity and access management teams juggle roughly 10 different tools to manage who and what has access to corporate systems. Venice’s platform consolidates that sprawl into a single system that handles privileged access across on-premises servers, SaaS applications, and cloud infrastructure for humans and non-human entities alike.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Tying everything together was what mattered to customers the most,” Lurie says. Indeed, Venice operates a SaaS subscription model, but Lurie insists it isn’t competing on price. “We reduce the cost, but it’s not because we go cheap on pricing,” she explains. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s because we spare all the overhead [associated with many of today’s offerings], especially the professional services” — the consultant fees and lengthy implementations that have become an almost unavoidable tax for enterprise security deployments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bet appears to be paying off. Lurie says Venice is now “completely replacing” legacy vendors at Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 customers, and cutting implementation time to just a week-and-a-half, from the typical six months to two years, thanks to AI-powered automation. While she declined to name customers on the record, she told TechCrunch off the record that they include a 170-year-old, publicly traded manufacturing giant as well as a global music conglomerate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cack Wilhelm, the partner at IVP who led Venice’s Series A, says Lurie stood out. “The problem with most cybersecurity pitches is everyone’s tackling something too small to ever be material,” Wilhelm says. “When you look at the massive exits — CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks — they were doing audacious things from the beginning. Rotem is the same.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wilhelm points to the urgency created by AI agents as a key factor driving IVP’s investment thesis. “If every individual is going to have tens of agents working on their behalf, and privileged access tools were built for a static world of IT professionals, we need our identity concept to adjust to that,” Wilhelm said. “Very often, when [companies] are breached, they’re breached by people simply logging in with someone else’s credentials. You solve that with just-in-time permissions that are scoped to the individual and the moment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though crowded, the market seems eager for new solutions. Identity and access management spending was expected to exceed $24 billion in 2025, increasing by 13% from a year earlier, according to an industry group called Identity Management Institute.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venice’s team is split between Israel, where R&amp;D is based, and North America, where the go-to-market team operates. Notably, nearly half of the cybersecurity company is women, a rarity in one of tech’s most stubbornly male-dominated sectors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lurie’s co-founder, Or Vaknin, serves as CTO (he’s pictured with Lurie, above). The company’s investors include Assaf Rappaport, co-founder and CEO of Wiz, and Raaz Herzberg, CMO at Wiz and Lurie’s former colleague from their days as interns at Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Lurie, who says she has spent much of her career as “the only woman in the room,” creating a more balanced team wasn’t a calculated act. “You can never see yourself doing something if you didn’t see someone like you doing it,” she says. “This is something that attracts other women — to feel like they can be part of it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question now is whether Venice’s two-year head start and early Fortune 500 wins will be enough to fend off deep-pocketed competitors as they chase the same enterprise buyers. Can the market support multiple winners? Or, will identity management follow the path of other security categories and consolidate around one or two dominant players?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move comes as the South Asian nation seeks to scale AI skills and build domestic capacity in one of the world’s largest talent markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, OpenAI said it was partnering with six public and private higher-education institutions in India, including top engineering, management, medical, and design-focused institutes, with the aim of reaching more than 100,000 students, faculty, and staff over the next year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than focusing on consumer use, the initiative centers on integrating AI into core academic functions, signaling OpenAI’s interest in influencing how AI is taught, governed, and normalized within one of the world’s largest higher-education systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has already built a large consumer audience for its ChatGPT chatbot, which has over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">100 million monthly active users</a> in India, according to CEO Sam Altman, and India has emerged as the company’s second-largest user base after the U.S. The announcement also coincides with a broader push by leading AI firms to deepen their presence in India, which is hosting an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first cohort of partners includes some of India’s most influential academic institutions, such as the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, alongside private universities and specialized design schools. The ChatGPT maker said the partnerships would span disciplines ranging from engineering and management to healthcare and creative fields.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has already emerged as a key testing ground for AI use in education. Last month, Google said India accounts for the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/india-is-teaching-google-how-ai-in-education-can-scale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">highest global usage of its Gemini tools for learning</a>. Microsoft, similarly, said this week it would <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/02/17/acting-with-urgency-to-address-the-growing-ai-divide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expand its Elevate skilling program</a> in India to train teachers across schools, vocational institutes, and higher-education settings, working with government agencies as part of a broader push to build AI skills at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said the partnerships would involve campus-wide access to its ChatGPT Edu tools, faculty training, and responsible-use frameworks. The focus, the company said, is on embedding AI into core academic workflows such as coding, research, analytics, and case analysis, rather than offering standalone access to tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two of the partner institutions, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, will also introduce OpenAI-backed certifications. Additionally, OpenAI said it would work with Indian ed-tech platforms, including Physics Wallah, upGrad, and HCL GUVI, to extend AI training beyond campuses. These platforms will launch structured courses on AI fundamentals and ChatGPT use cases, aimed at students and early-career professionals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Raghav Gupta, head of education at OpenAI India, said educational institutions were a “critical route” to closing the gap between rapidly advancing AI tools and how people are actually using them, as skills demands shift across the economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, OpenAI hired Gupta, a former Coursera Asia-Pacific managing director, as its India and Asia-Pacific head of education, alongside the launch of a Learning Accelerator program focused on expanding AI skills.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flurry of moves into education underscores how AI companies are increasingly looking beyond consumer tools and corporate clients toward institutions that shape skills, norms, and long-term adoption. For countries like India, the contest is not just around access to AI, but also about who helps define how it is taught, governed, and embedded at scale.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That user base helped push its annual recurring revenue to $4 billion by the end of year, Canva co-founder and COO Cliff Obrecht told TechCrunch on the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar. The subscription-based company also saw its B2B business, which accounts for companies with more than 25 seats, grow by 100% with $500 million in ARR. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company still sees the majority of its business from North America, with continued growth in international markets. To increase paying users, Canva has introduced lower-priced subscriptions in countries like Pakistan, Uruguay, Morocco, and Jamaica.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canva’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/07/canva-wants-you-to-pay-a-lot-more-for-its-ai-features/\">AI investments</a> are paying off, according to Obrecht. The company debuted a tool that lets users create <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/canva-is-adding-an-ai-assistant-coding-and-sheets-to-its-platform/\">mini apps and websites using AI last year</a>. Obrecht noted the tool has more than 10 million monthly active users now. It’s been successful enough that the company is thinking about putting AI at the center and acting like a “design agency in your pocket,” Obrecht said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That shift to AI comes as Canva faces competition from the likes of Adobe, Freepik, and Apple, which has pushed to become a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/apple-launches-creator-studio-bundle-of-apps-for-12-99-per-month/\">full-packaged creator suite</a> by bundling apps like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage into a $12.99 per month Creator Studio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where we started was… we got the Canva platform, and we’re giving the Canva platform a bunch of AI tools. We’re inverting that now. We’re becoming an AI platform with a bunch of design tools. So you can think of it more like a cursor for design,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canva is also actively integrating with chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude. It said that by October 2025, users had more than 26 million conversations with the Canva app on ChatGPT. It also claimed that Canva was one of the top 10 referred domains from ChatGPT.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obrecht said that the company is allocating resources to work on having Canva surface in LLM search results, along with working on SEO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So we drove a lot of early days in Canva through Google, really understood people’s search intent, and delivered them content that they could then go into our product and edit. And so we really see ChatGPT or any of the LLMs top of the funnel acquisition platforms,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He noted that while search is a big driving factor, traffic through LLM referrals is in double-digit percentages. The company is also allocating resources to have Canva surface more in chatbots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canva was last valued at $42 billion in a share sell. Obrecht told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-21/canva-s-obrecht-says-firm-eyeing-ipo-in-next-couple-of-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> last November that the company will go public in the next “couple of years.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A video demo showed a user clicking a dedicated AI button on a feature phone to converse with an AI assistant in a local language to get guidance on government schemes or local markets. It is not clear if all the AI features showcased at the event will work offline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Through edge AI, we want to bring intelligence to every phone, laptop, car, and even a new generation of devices,” Tushar Goswamy, head of Edge AI at Sarvam, said during a presentation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said that the company has worked with Qualcomm to tune its models for the latter’s chipsets. Sarvam didn’t provide details on which devices the models will be deployed to. Qualcomm said that it is developing a “Sovereign AI Experience Suite” that would work across a range of devices, including phones, PCs, laptops, cars, and IoT devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies can accelerate how we take sovereign AI from research to deployment,” Sarvam co-founder Vivek Raghavan said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This will allow Sarvam to design models and applications that run closer to the edge, safeguard data, and are ready for adoption, at scale.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarvam also said it is working with German engineering giant Bosch to bring AI assistants to cars, though it didn’t disclose many other details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also showed off a pair of AI smart glasses, dubbed Sarvam Kaze, designed and manufactured in India. The company’s co-founder, Pratyush Kumar, said the glasses are a “builders’ device” and will be available in May.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarvam has so far operated largely in the enterprise market, offering its voice-focused models for use cases like customer support.
