The iPhone maker is not making these changes because it wants to be more open; it’s being forced — in this case, to comply with the country’s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which is now going into effect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/app-distribution-in-japan/\">this update</a>, Apple’s App Store revenues are being impacted in another major market due to anticompetition laws and regulations. The company already has to comply with Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which previously required the tech giant to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110\">allow for alternative app stores</a> and other changes. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the U.S., Apple has been strong-armed into changing its in-payments system <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-just-scored-a-major-win-against-apple/\">by way of the courts</a>, after a lawsuit from Fortnite maker, Epic Games. Though it was not declared a monopoly, the court decided Apple needed to give developers the right to process payments outside of its system if they chose. (The specifics around that order are still being worked out after an appeal <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-appeals-court-partly-reverses-sanctions-against-apple-epic-games-antitrust-2025-12-11/\">partially reversed an earlier ruling.</a>)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As usual, in its announcement about the changes in Japan, Apple warned that alternative app marketplaces and payments open up “new avenues for malware, fraud, scams, and privacy and security risks.” To mitigate those risks, the company said it worked with Japanese regulators to require an authorization process for app marketplaces (“Notarization”), which it says is designed to protect children specifically from inappropriate content and scams. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that Apple has come up with a process to dial back the risk for alternative app stores indicates there has always been a technical solution at hand to balance the needs for both openness and security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As in the EU, Apple has come up with a complex fee structure to ensure it doesn’t lose much in the form of App Store revenue, while seemingly complying with the letter of the law.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077346\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg 1770w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=1200,791 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=1280,843 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=430,283 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=720,474 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=900,593 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=800,527 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1012 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=668,440 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=569,375 569w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=937,617 937w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=708,466 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">APPLE</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, of course, was not silent on this matter, saying Fortnite will still not return to iOS in Japan because Apple is charging a 21% fee on third-party in-app purchases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2001494517996732598\">In a post on X, he wrote</a>, “Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.

At <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/\">launch</a>, the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG went public last year via a merger with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/\">special-purpose acquisition company</a> (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-25-040977.pdf\">reported</a> that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">only one experimental device</a> has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</a> and Sam Altman-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/helion-raises-425m-to-help-build-a-fusion-reactor-for-microsoft/\">Helion</a>, are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">in the race</a> to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/google-places-another-fusion-power-bet-on-tae-technologies/\">recent $150 million round</a> from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Users can also provide a start and an end frame to guide the model to generate transitional footage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said Thursday the Ray3 Modify model solves the problems of preserving human performance while editing or generating effects using AI for creative studios. The startup said the model follows the input footage better, allowing studios to use human actors for creative or brand footage. Luma mentioned the new model retains the actor’s original motion, timing, eye line, and emotional delivery while transforming the scene.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Ray3 Modify, users can provide a character reference for transformation to the original footage and convert the human actor’s appearance into that character. This reference also allows creators to retain information like costumes, likeness, and identity across the shoot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, users can also provide start and end reference frames to create a video using the new Ray3 Modify model. This is helpful for creators in directing transitions or controlling character movements or behaviour while maintaining continuity between scenes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Luma AI - Introducing Ray3 Modify\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s-wRxtSKC0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Generative video models are incredibly expressive but also hard to control. Today, we are excited to introduce Ray3 Modify that blends the real-world with the expressivity of AI while giving full control to creatives. This means creative teams can capture performances with a camera and then immediately modify them to be in any location imaginable, change costumes, or even go back and reshoot the scene with AI, without recreating the physical shoot,” Amit Jain, co-founder and CEO of Luma AI, said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luma said the new model is available to users through the company’s Dream Machine platform. The company, which competes with the likes of Runway and Kling, released <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lumalabs.ai/blog/news/introducing-modify-video?utm_source=alphasignal\">video modification capabilities</a> in June 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The model release comes on the back of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/19/luma-ai-raises-900-million-in-funding-led-by-saudi-ai-firm-humain.html\">a fresh $900 million funding round</a>, led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, for the startup announced in November. Existing investors like a16z, Amplify Partners, and Matrix Partners also participated in the round. The startup is also planning to build a 2GW AI cluster in Saudi Arabia along with Humain. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Khosla Ventures, Salesforce Ventures and Databricks Ventures also participated, as did other investors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This raise comes mere months after Lovable raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/lovable-becomes-a-unicorn-with-200m-series-a-just-8-months-after-launch/\">$200 million Series A round</a> that valued the company at $1.8 billion in July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the quickest to capitalize on the AI boom, Lovable has built a “vibe-coding” tool that lets people use text prompts to write code and build complete apps. The company launched in 2024, and has grown blazing fast: it reached the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/eight-months-in-swedish-unicorn-lovable-crosses-the-100m-arr-milestone/\">vaunted $100 million ARR milestone</a> within eight months, and just four months later, doubled that to surpass <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/as-lovable-hits-200m-arr-its-ceo-credits-staying-in-europe-for-its-success/\">$200 million in annual recurring revenue</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company counts major software names like Klarna, Uber and Zendesk as customers, and claims that more than 100,000 new projects are built on its platform every day, and more than 25 million projects were created in its first year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovable said it would use the new funding for building deeper integrations with third-party apps, expanding its features for enterprise use-cases, and flesh out its platform with the infrastructure needed — like databases, payments and hosting — to build full-fledged applications and services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovable co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said on stage at this year’s Slush conference in Helsinki, Finland that he credits the company’s ability to scale to his decision to ignore calls from investors to relocate the company to Silicon Valley.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said on stage at the November conference. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘Look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country.’ There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, the company was called out for not paying VAT, a tax that applies to most goods and services in the European Union (EU). Osika confirmed that this was true in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antonosika_lovable-just-got-called-out-for-not-paying-activity-7399176055850364928-Yq78/\">LinkedIn post</a>, saying that the company would remedy the situation, and shut down comments saying taxes like this are why the EU isn’t a good home for high-growth startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vibe coding continues to be a hot area of investing for VCs.

You can set an instruction such as “If someone comes to the door trying to sell something, politely let them know we’re not interested.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And if you’re busy or not home, Alexa can greet friends or family when they visit, and ask them to leave a message for you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It goes without saying that the tech presents the risk of misidentifying people and responding inappropriately — if, for example, a friend works in logistics and comes to see you after work in their delivery uniform, Ring may, via Alexa, ask them to leave the package somewhere instead of letting them leave a message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature follows a controversial facial recognition feature for Ring called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">“Familiar Faces”</a> that lets you create a catalog of the faces of up to 50 people who visit you regularly.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/ftc-investigating-instacarts-ai-pricing-tool-source-says-2025-12-17/\">According to Reuters</a>, Instacart is currently getting the regulatory equivalent of a throat-clearing from the FTC, which has sent the grocery delivery platform a civil investigative demand regarding its AI-powered pricing tool, Eversight. Put another way, the agency wants to know why some people are paying substantially more for their organic granola than others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue came to light after a study revealed that shoppers are seeing fairly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/study-shows-instacart-may-be-charging-some-shoppers-20-more-for-the-same-product/\">different prices</a> for identical groceries from the same stores — up to 23% higher prices in some cases. Instacart says these price tests were randomized, not tied to an algorithm that targets customers based on their browsing history. But when people are already anxious about affording eggs, that distinction probably doesn’t mean much.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dynamic pricing isn’t new or necessarily nefarious. Harvard Business School will tell you it’s how digital platforms stay competitive. Airlines use it, hotels use it, Uber famously uses it. Companies argue that it helps balance supply and demand, maximizes profitability, and creates win-win scenarios.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there’s a difference between paying surge pricing for a ride home from the bar and paying extra for groceries (food isn’t optional). So while the investigation doesn’t prove wrongdoing, it’s hardly shocking that the FTC — which has investigated data-driven <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-ftc-looking-into-targeted-pricing-based-personal-data-2024-07-23/\">pricing strategies</a> by other companies — is reportedly asking questions. In an economy where everyone’s feeling squeezed, AI-driven price testing of kitchen essentials was bound to attract attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For its part, Instacart says the market misunderstands this particular initiative. “Much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,” a spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch. “First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing – prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores.” <br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The software firm has launched a number of different AI services since 2023, including<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/adobe-firefly-now-supports-prompt-based-video-editing-adds-more-third-party-models/\"> Firefly</a> — its AI-powered media-generation suite. Now, however, the company’s full-throated embrace of the technology may have led to trouble, as a new lawsuit claims it used pirated books to train one of its AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Elizabeth Lyon, an author from Oregon, claims that Adobe used pirated versions of numerous books — including her own — to train the company’s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09944v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SlimLM program</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe describes SlimLM as a small language model series that can be “optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices.” It<a href=\"https://research.adobe.com/publication/slimlm-an-efficient-small-language-model-for-on-device-document-assistance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> states that</a> SlimLM was pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B, a “deduplicated, multi-corpora, open-source dataset”<a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/blog/slimpajama-a-627b-token-cleaned-and-deduplicated-version-of-redpajama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> released by Cerebras</a> in June of 2023. Lyon, who has written a number of guidebooks for non-fiction writing, says that some of her works were included in a pretraining dataset that Adobe had used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyon’s lawsuit, which was<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/adobe-sued-allegedly-misusing-authors-work-ai-training-2025-12-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> originally reported</a> on by Reuters, says that her writing was included in a processed subset of a manipulated dataset that was the basis of Adobe’s program: “The SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3),” the lawsuit says. “Thus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Books3” — a huge <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/books3-database-generative-ai-training-copyright-infringement/675363/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">collection of 191,000 books</a> that have been used to train GenAI systems — has been an ongoing source of legal trouble for the tech community. RedPajama has also been cited in a number of litigation cases. In September, <a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-faces-lawsuit-over-use-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a lawsuit </a>against Apple claimed the company had used copyrighted material to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-sued-over-use-copyrighted-books-train-apple-intelligence-2025-10-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">train its Apple Intelligence model</a>. The litigation mentioned the dataset and accused the tech company of copying protected works “without consent and without credit or compensation.” In October, a similar lawsuit against Salesforce<a href=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/salesforce-used-pirated-books-to-train-9970854/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> also</a> claimed the company had used RedPajama for training purposes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately for the tech industry, such lawsuits have, by now, become somewhat commonplace. AI algorithms are trained on massive datasets and, in some cases, those datasets have allegedly included pirated materials. In September, Anthropic<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/g-s1-87367/anthropic-authors-settlement-pirated-chatbot-training-material\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> agreed to pay $1.5 billion</a> to a number of authors who had sued it and accused it of using pirated versions of their work to train its chatbot, Claude. The case was considered a potential turning point in the ongoing legal battles over copyrighted material in AI training data, of which there are many.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It was a volatile year for Isaacman, though, as Trump pulled his nomination in June after becoming <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/21/science/elon-musk-sean-duffy-nasa-spacex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">concerned about</a> the billionaire’s “prior associations.” (Isaacman had previously donated to Democrats, something Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/us/politics/trump-musk-isaacman-nasa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was reportedly aware of</a> when he first nominated the entrepreneur.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That led to months of sniping between Trump’s camp and people more closely aligned with Isaacman, like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who publicly attacked the credibility of acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy. Trump ultimately flipped in November and re-nominated Isaacman. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The billionaire will now oversee a trimmed-down space agency that Trump has tasked with returning to the moon.

The decision is in response to a recent <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/billboard-charts-add-more-weight-on-demand-streaming-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">change</a> Billboard made to its ranking formula, which continues to add more weight to paid, on-demand streaming compared with ad-supported, free streaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Billboard justified its decision to adjust its age-old formula by saying that the change will “better reflect an increase in streaming revenue and changing consumer behaviors.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, streaming now matters more than buying albums or songs, so it wants its charts to reflect that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, YouTube doesn’t like the new formula because it doesn’t want there to be much — if any — differentiation between free and paid streams, especially if the changes are meant to reflect how consumers today are enjoying music. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Billboard uses an outdated formula that weights subscription-supported streams higher than ad-supported. This doesn’t reflect how fans engage with music today and ignores the massive engagement from fans who don’t have a subscription,” a YouTube blog post published on Wednesday <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-billboard-chart-update/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">explains</a>. “Streaming is the primary way people experience music, <a href=\"https://www.riaa.com/growth-in-paid-subscription-streaming-drives-mid-year-2025-us-recorded-music-revenues-to-new-high-reports-riaa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">making up 84%</a> of U.S. recorded music revenue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re simply asking that every stream is counted fairly and equally, whether it is subscription-based or ad-supported—because every fan matters and every play should count,” the post notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ranking changes will be reflected starting with the charts published on January 17, which will include data from January 2-8, 2026. This will impact the Billboard 200 lists and genre-based album charts. In addition, the ratio between paid/subscription and ad-supported on-demand streaming tiers will be adjusted to 2.5:1 for the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To protest the new formula, YouTube said it will no longer provide data to Billboard after January 16, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s what that change means in practice: Under the revised calculation, Billboard said it will take 33.3% fewer ad-supported on-demand streams of songs from an album, and 20% fewer paid/subscription on-demand streams of songs from an album, to equal an album unit. In short, it will take fewer streams than before for an album to climb the charts. This is a win for streaming in general but not necessarily for YouTube.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s why. At present, the formula Billboard uses defines an album unit (the standard measurement for chart rankings) as one album sale. It counts 10 individual songs from an album as one album consumption unit, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the streaming side, it currently says an album unit equals 3,750 ad-supported streams — like YouTube’s  — or 1,250 paid/subscription official audio and video streams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the changes, those figures will be adjusted, so it will take 2,500 ad-supported streams or 1,000 paid/subscription streams to count as one album unit. This means paid streams count 2.5x as much as ad-supported streams. While that’s less of a gap than the current 3:1 ratio, it’s still not what YouTube would prefer seeing here. The company is essentially doing what companies do in failed negotiations like this: it’s taking its ball and going home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, by not cooperating with Billboard, YouTube’s music data won’t be considered in chart rankings, which could lead labels and artists to deprioritize publishing their music on YouTube. That’s not a good long-term strategy for YouTube as an important player in the streaming music era. That’s why this move should be viewed as the negotiation tactic it is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are committed to achieving equitable representation across the charts and hopefully can work with Billboard to return to theirs,” YouTube’s announcement concludes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The program was part of the company’s metaverse push — the idea behind the program was to create a “<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new generation of hardware</a>” that would give VR users their pick of devices when it came to engaging with Meta’s digital worlds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have paused the program to focus on building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’re committed to this for the long term and will revisit opportunities for third-party device partnerships as the category evolves.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news was<a href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-third-party-headset-cancelled-asus-lenovo/#google_vignette\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> originally reported</a> by Road to VR.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last April, the tech giant<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> announced that</a> it would be opening up Meta Horizon OS to third-party headset makers. At the time, the company said that Asus, Microsoft’s Xbox, and Lenovo, were all working on creating new hardware that would run the company’s software. “As we’ve seen with the PC and smartphone industries, consumers are best served by a broad hardware ecosystem producing both general-purpose computing devices and more specialized products, all running on a common platform,” the company said at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Between the announcement of the partner program and now, there haven’t been a whole lot of updates about it. In September, at the company’s Connect event, a Meta spokesperson<a href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-asus-lenovo-quest-connect-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> said that</a> Meta was still working with its business partners to push Horizon OS into more devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Horizon OS was designed to deliver “mixed reality experiences,” and to communicate “social presence” through technologies like hand, body, eye, and face tracking.

The advisory said affected devices have a feature called “Spam Quarantine” enabled and are reachable from the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cisco noted that this feature is not enabled by default and does not need to be exposed to the internet, which may be good news. <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@mttaggart/115735885528149384\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Michael Taggart</a>, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health Sciences, told TechCrunch that “the requirement of an internet-facing management interface and certain features being enabled will limit the attack surface for this vulnerability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, <a href=\"https://elk.zone/infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/115736098425798888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kevin Beaumont</a>, a security researcher who tracks hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that this appears to be a particularly problematic hacking campaign since a lot of big organizations use the affected products, there are no patches available, and it’s unclear how long the hackers had backdoors in the affected systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this point Cisco is not saying how many customers are affected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch, Cisco spokesperson Meredith Corley did not answer a series of questions, and instead said that the company “is actively investigating the issue and developing a permanent remediation.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this hacking campaign?

Professional mode lets you convert your personal profile into a creator profile while making your content eligible for discovery by a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This would directly impact creators and brands posting links from their blogs or other platforms to reach a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it is trying to learn how it can add more value to Meta Verified subscribers, and this test is one such experiment to enhance that paid plan. The company added that, at the moment, publishers are not included in this test. It also said that users can still post links in comments, and they are not impacted by the limit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its <a href=\"https://transparency.meta.com/reports/widely-viewed-content-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">transparency report for Q3</a>, Meta said that more than 98% views on the feed in the U.S. come from the posts that don’t have any links. It is not clear if this signal pushed the company to experiment with limits on link sharing, however. The company said that the majority of the 1.9% of views of posts with links came from a page they followed. Linked posts shared by friends and groups were minimal.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076972\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg 738w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=720,380 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=668,352 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=708,373 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same report noted that YouTube and TikTok, along with GoFundMe, were the top domains amid the links posted.

At AWS’s recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/all-the-biggest-news-from-aws-big-tech-show-reinvent-2025/\">re:Invent</a> event, Amazon hammered home its commitment to AI for enterprise use, so it makes sense that the company is spinning out a new team from AWS leadership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With our Nova 2 models just launched at re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,” Jassy wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s increasing emphasis on AI comes at a time when the company is eager to strengthen its foothold in the AI race, perhaps more through investments than its own innovations.

Some of those companies have re-emerged, though, with VanMoof and Cake finding new owners during their respective court-led restructuring processes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad itself had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/rad-power-bikes-faces-shutdown-in-january-without-new-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told employees</a> in November that there had been a “very promising” option to keep the company afloat that was “likely to close,” but the deal fell apart. The company has not shared more details about that potential deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weeks later, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/rad-power-bikes-batteries-receive-major-fire-risk-warning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">warning</a> that older Rad Power batteries posed “a risk of serious injury and death” after receiving 31 reports of fires. Rad Power said it “strongly disagrees” with the CPSC’s characterizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad’s tough November came at the end of a fairly tumultuous few years for the company. It has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/rad-power-bikes-ceo-steps-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">swapped CEOs</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/rad-power-bikes-already-has-a-new-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earlier this year</a>, bringing in an executive with decades of experience turning around underperforming companies. That new CEO, Kathi Lentzsch, said Rad was shifting away from the direct-to-consumer model that had helped fuel its rise and toward a retail-focused approach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This shift creates new opportunities to reach more riders, strengthen customer relationships, and evolve the brand in meaningful ways,” she said in a statement at the time. “[I]t’s an incredible time to come on board.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it entered the bankruptcy process with $32 million in assets and $73 million in liabilities. More than $8 million of its debt was owed to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency for unpaid tariffs. (The company has listed this claim as “disputed” in the bankruptcy paperwork.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how much that contributed to Rad’s slide into bankruptcy. But it wouldn’t be the first time that Donald Trump’s tariffs helped push a micromobility company over the edge. During his first term, Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22575594/boosted-electric-skateboard-khosla-lime-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">helped take the remaining wind out of</a> electric skateboard company Boosted’s sails.

Heck, Radiant itself raised $165 million <a href=\"https://www.radiantnuclear.com/blog/series-c-close/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">just six months ago</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the string of investments, it seems reasonable to ask whether the nuclear world is in a bubble. Investment in the technology has tracked closely with the data center boom. AI requires tremendous amounts of electricity, and tech companies and data center developers have been rushing to secure supplies from sources ranging from nuclear fission to supersonic jet engines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As long as tech companies’ power demands continue to grow, interest in nuclear is likely to remain strong. But there might be a winnowing of the field in the next year or two if startups don’t deliver on their promises, many of which revolve around starting their first reactor next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some startups might be able to buy some time after that. First-of-a-kind reactors can be built by hand, but many nuclear startups are predicated on the idea that mass manufacturing will make fission cost-competitive. They might succeed at reaching criticality but stumble when they try to replicate their designs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of this is to say that Radiant will fall into that category; it may very well succeed. Rather, the company just happens to be the latest in a long list of nuclear startups that have announced eye-popping fundraises in the last few months. Anytime a market gets that frothy, the B-word is bound to pop up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by Draper Associates and Boost VC with participation from Ark Venture Fund, Chevron Technology Ventures, Friends &amp; Family Capital, Founders Fund, and others. It values Radiant at more than $1.8 billion. Previous investors include Andreessen Horowitz, DCVC, Giant Ventures, and Union Square Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Radiant is developing a microreactor capable of generating 1 megawatt of electricity that can be delivered via semi. It will be cooled by helium and will have enough TRISO fuel — carbon and ceramic-coated beads of graphite and uranium that are designed to be more resistant to meltdowns — to last five years between refueling. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is aiming to replace diesel generators at commercial and military sites. Customers will be able to buy the units outright or subscribe to a power-purchase agreement. When the reactor’s 20-year lifetime is up, the company will haul it away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like many nuclear startups, Radiant is targeting data centers as some of its first customers. The company signed a deal with data center developer Equinix in August to supply 20 of its reactors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, Radiant is building a demonstration reactor at the Idaho National Lab, which it hopes to begin testing in the summer of 2026. Many nuclear startups are on a similar timeline, one set by the Trump administration’s goal of three reactors achieving criticality — the moment when a nuclear reaction is self-sustaining — by July 4, 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Radiant is one of 11 companies selected for that program, which doesn’t provide government grants or loans but instead speeds approval timelines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction 1:20 pm ET: Radiant’s reactor will be refueled once every five years, not months as previously stated.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In comparison, Gemini 3 Pro scored 37.5%, Gemini 2.5 Flash scored 11%, and the newly released GPT-5.2 scored 34.5%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the multimodality and reasoning benchmark MMMU-Pro, the new model outscored all competitors with an 81.2% score. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-consumer-rollout\">Consumer rollout</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is making Gemini 3 Flash the default model in the Gemini app globally, replacing Gemini 2.5 Flash. Users can still choose the Pro model from the model picker for math and coding questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the new model is good at identifying multimodal content and giving you an answer based on that. For instance, you can upload your pickleball short video and ask for tips; you can try drawing a sketch and have the model guess what you are drawing; or you can upload an audio recording to get analysis or generate a quiz.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also said the model better understands the intent of users’ queries and can generate more visual answers with elements like images and tables.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also use the new model to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/googles-vibe-coding-tool-opal-comes-to-gemini/\">create app prototypes</a> in the Gemini app using prompts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Gemini 3 Pro is now available to everyone in the U.S. for search and more people in the U.S. can access the Nano Banana Pro image model in search, as well.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-enterprise-and-developer-availability\">Enterprise and developer availability</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google noted that companies like JetBrains, Figma, Cursor, Harvey, and Latitude are already using the Gemini 3 Flash model, which is available through Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For developers, the company is making the model available in a preview model through the API and in Antigravity, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\">Google’s new coding tool released last month</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said the Gemini 3 Pro scores 78% on the SWE-bench verified coding benchmark, only outperformed by GPT-5.2. It added that the model is ideal for video analysis, data extraction, and visual Q&amp;A, and because of its speed, it is suited for quick and repeatable workflows.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?w=544\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076854\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=960,1200 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=1024,1280 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=344,430 344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=576,720 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=720,900 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=640,800 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=534,668 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=300,375 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=494,617 494w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=425,531 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=40,50 40w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Model pricing is $0.50 per 1 million input tokens and $3.00 per 1 million output tokens. This is slightly more expensive than $0.30 per 1 million input tokens and $2.50 per 1 million output tokens of Gemini Flash 2.5. But Google claims that the new model outperforms the Gemini 2.5 Pro model while being three times faster. And, for thinking tasks, it uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro.

The companies said the merger will be finalized in the second half of next year, pending regulatory review and shareholder approval.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This agreement comes at a challenging time for both Udemy and Coursera, as each faces market headwinds. Despite both companies posting revenue growth in the <a href=\"https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2025/Coursera-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">third quarter</a> of 2025, their share prices declined, underscoring investors’ lack of confidence in the platforms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a <a href=\"https://www.courseraandudemy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">combined company</a>, Udemy and Coursera aimed to reassure shareholders, suggesting that the combined strengths of both platforms could deliver both immediate returns as well as long-term growth potential.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Through this combination with Coursera, we will create meaningful benefits for our learners, enterprise customers, and instructors, while delivering significant value to our shareholders, who will participate in the substantial upside potential of the combined company,” Udemy CEO Hugo Sarrazin said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Additionally, as the online learning market continues to expand — particularly with the adoption of AI — Sarrazin said the merger will accelerate plans to introduce AI-powered products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Coursera recently announced an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\">integration</a> with OpenAI’s ChatGPT app ecosystem and a <a href=\"https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2025/Coursera-Partners-with-Anthropic-and-Launches-New-AI-Content-to-Drive-Responsible-AI-Innovation-and-Workforce-Transformation-at-Scale/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">content partnership</a> with Anthropic.

To work, the app matches you with friends from your saved contacts in your phone’s address book — but only if both people have opted in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Contact import has always been the most effective way to find people you know on a social app, but it’s also been poorly implemented or abused by platforms,” the company explained in its <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/12-16-2025-find-friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement</a>. “Even with encryption, phone numbers have been leaked or brute-forced, sold to spammers, or used by platforms for dubious purposes. We weren’t willing to accept that risk, so we developed a fundamentally more secure approach that protects your data.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, social apps in the past often used contact matching as a lead-generation tool. That is, if the app found you had friends who were not on its service, it would recommend you “add” them. This would then send the friend an invite via text. Typically, those on the receiving end would not appreciate this app spam, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/07/path-uploads-your-iphones-address-book-to-their-servers-without-a-peep/\">method</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/dont-get-played-by-this-spammy-app-like-i-did/\">has</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/26/photo-sharing-app-lapse-hits-top-of-the-app-store-by-forcing-you-to-invite-your-friends/\">long</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/everalbum-is-proof-that-sms-spam-still-works/\">been</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/\">effective</a>, and it helped apps go viral, as at least some of the invited users would download and try the app out of curiosity. But despite the initial buzz this method can create, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/creator-of-gas-and-tbh-makes-an-app-for-disappearing-photos-via-imessage/\">it’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse-buzz-is-already-fading-but-andreessen-horowitz-isnt-put-off.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">not a guaranteed way</a> to lock in users for the long term.

This prevents bad actors from uploading random numbers in order to fish for information about Bluesky users, the company notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early adopters should note that contact matching may take some time, but more people will begin showing up in this screen as more Bluesky users upload their own contacts to be matched. You’ll only be matched with friends if both you and your friend have each other in your respective address books. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’d rather not be found by those you know from work or your real life, you can simply choose not to use the feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky says it stores uploaded contact information in hashed pairs, where your number is combined with each contact’s number.
