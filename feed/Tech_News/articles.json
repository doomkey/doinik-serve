Preply, for instance, will use the proceeds of its latest round to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dmytrovoloshyn_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%96-%D1%96%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%BC%D1%96%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B9%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%B2%D1%88%D1%96-%D1%96%D0%BD%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D1%83-activity-7422569547120947201-fg6I/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\">hire some 100 engineers</a> across its global teams — including in Ukraine, where one-third of its engineering staff is based.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Preply is one example among many. Defense tech <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/three-years-on-europe-looks-to-ukraine-for-the-future-of-defense-tech/\">has grabbed the most attention</a>, especially for the speed at which innovations reach the battlefield. But the same engineering talent and ingenuity are emerging as a common denominators across sectors that also contribute to strengthening Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Ukraine facing a far larger attacker, the country <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mod.gov.ua/en/news/step-by-step-procedure-for-service-members-wishing-to-return-to-duty-after-an-absence-without-leave-awol\">takes a dim view</a> of efforts to escape mobilization. However, startups can be granted special status that shields key employees from the draft if they are deemed to support the country — and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://luminify.aspichi.com/\">Aspichi</a> is one of them, its founder, Victor Samoilenko, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Originally created in the U.S. in 2021, the company completely pivoted when the war started. It is now best known for Luminify, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tech.eu/2026/02/11/ukraines-wartime-vr-therapy-is-scaling-beyond-trauma-care/\">a mixed-reality platform for mental health care</a> that has been helping Ukrainians cope with wartime trauma. The startup collaborates directly with military units as well as with a dozen clinics that provide mental health support to the population.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are soldiers and veterans, bereaved families, and millions who have moved to western Ukraine or abroad. And for those who have always lived in Kyiv, the psychological toll is no less horrendous. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everybody is suffering,” Samoilenko said. “My daughter celebrated several New Year’s and Christmas underground; so the effect is enormous.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a winter marked by near-daily attacks on the power grid, Ukraine’s capital hasn’t been spared. According to Natali Trubnikova, CMO at Kyiv-based IT consultancy firm <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gartsolutions.com/\">Gart Solutions</a>, locals have adapted to power cuts with high-capacity power banks, gasoline stoves, and diesel generators. But rising costs mean they still have to use these sparingly, often keeping indoor temperatures to a strict minimum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These harsh conditions have turned offices into refuges from the cold. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our office has different generators so we have electricity, internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch last month.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For smaller startups, coworking spaces have also become havens. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lift99kyiv.co/\">LIFT99 Kyiv Hub</a>, a six-year-old venue that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://estonianworld.com/security/estonian-founded-startup-hub-lift99-in-kyiv-hit-by-russian-missile-strike/\">suffered damage</a> from a Russian strike last August, has seen its membership numbers surge since its reopening two months ago, its sales and partnership manager Lada Samarska <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lsamarska_kyiv-right-now-up-to-4-hours-of-electricity-ugcPost-7422674329580023808-nRf1\">wrote</a> on LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite missile strikes, Kyiv is far enough from the frontline to remain Ukraine’s main startup hub, but it is not the only one. Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, has drawn many displaced Ukrainians — tech workers among them. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lemstation.com/en/\">LEM Station</a>, a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://creativesunite.eu/article/how-lem-station-is-transforming-a-historic-tram-depot-in-lviv\">renovated tram depot</a> turned creative space, is a symbol of its growing ecosystem, which has also benefited from its proximity to the Polish border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foreign visitors have been fewer, but with Lviv still reachable by train, tech conference IT Arena 2025 <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://itarena.ua/it-arena-2025-ai-technology-and-humans-in-the-fight-for-tomorrow/\">brought 6,450 participants</a> from more than 40 countries to the city.  Defense tech had its own stage, but the event also showcased support for a wider range of startups. Despite the war, VC firms remain active in the country, including <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.1991.vc/\">1991</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/07/10/flyer-one-ventures-launches-eur50m-fund-v-to-back-cee-and-ukrainian-startups/\">Flyer One Ventures</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://smrk.vc/en/\">SMRK</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the long journey, Ukrainians are still making the trip to tech conferences abroad too. At Techarena in Stockholm earlier this month, members of a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://itukraine.org.ua/en/calendar_events/techstep-sweden-ukrainian-delegation-at-techarena-2026/\">Ukrainian delegation</a> told TechCrunch they were tired and waiting for the spring. But before saying goodbye, they started listing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.uawalloffame.com/\">Ukraine’s unicorns</a> — because that’s what you do, even in the middle of a war.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The full stock award is conditional on AMD’s share price, which would need to hit $600 for Meta to receive its final tranche, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-and-amd-agree-to-ai-chips-deal-worth-more-than-100-billion-9c7fd06b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcY1w7p4jt-HxCrx0DI-zmkO9gpjvyM3_PmfM0dnu1-Ku4Q1YPHtmLW-NXzKY0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699dbdee&amp;gaa_sig=exel6GajVHvnTh0czYE8aB9ib1uMxyyq5a5XlxrkBILGUpUjQ8my4K5eP1Q5hmfV7MAX-pmdS63L5dg3kdsPRw%3D%3D\">per The Wall Street Journal</a>. AMD’s stock closed at $196.60 on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the agreement, Meta will purchase AMD’s MI540 series of GPUs and its latest generation of CPUs. CPUs are increasingly becoming a core pillar of the AI inference compute stack because they’re efficient, easier to scale, and don’t tie companies solely to Nvidia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The CPU market is absolutely on fire,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said Tuesday morning during an investor briefing. “There is significant demand. It has continued to grow, and it really is a result of the AI infrastructure deployments as inferencing scales, as agentic AI scales, and our portfolio is in an extremely good position.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AMD has been slowly gaining ground as AI firms look to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, which has been the longstanding leader in AI chips and has charged a premium for the title. Last October, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/\">AMD and OpenAI struck a similar</a> deal trading equity for an agreement to buy chips. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the firm’s partnership with AMD is “an important step” as it diversifies its compute and works towards “personal superintelligence.” Zuckerberg has defined personal superintelligence as AI systems designed to deeply understand and empower individuals in their everyday lives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has pledged to invest at least <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-plans-600-billion-us-spend-ai-data-centers-expand-2025-11-07/\">$600 billion in U.S. data centers</a> and AI infrastructure over the next several years, including a projected capital expenditure spend of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\">$135 billion in 2026.</a> Meta recently unveiled plans for a $10 billion <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/gas-power-plants-approved-for-metas-10b-data-center-and-not-everyone-is-happy/\">gas-powered data center campus</a> in Indiana designed for 1 gigawatt of compute capacity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AMD partnership comes a couple of weeks after Meta struck a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/880513/nvidia-meta-ai-grace-vera-chips?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">multiyear deal </a>to expand its data centers with millions of Nvidia’s latest CPUs and GPUs.

The company says the model supports questions spanning the full reproductive health spectrum, from early menstrual cycles through menopause. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new model is rolling out in Oura Labs, the company’s opt-in, experimental feature hub within the Oura app. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oura says the new model draws on established medical standards, research, and knowledge sources reviewed by its in-house team of board-certified clinicians and women’s health experts.

By designing a model specifically for women and grounding it in trusted clinical science and real-world biometric data, we’re setting the standard for how responsible intelligence should be built and expanded across more areas of health, pairing rigorous science with the lived, longitudinal data that makes Oura uniquely powerful.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch of the new women’s health AI model comes as Oura chief commercial officer Dorothy Kilroy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/oura-is-winning-young-women-and-losing-gym-rats-and-its-fine-with-that/\">told TechCrunch</a> last October that the company’s fastest-growing user segment isn’t gym rats, it’s women in their early twenties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When a user asks Oura Advisor a women’s health question, the chatbot prompts the new model to reference its research and knowledge sources while also analyzing the user’s relevant biometric signals across sleep, activity, cycle and pregnancy data, stress, and more. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new model is intentionally designed to be non-dismissive, reassuring, and emotionally supportive, the company notes.

It was a failure of approach.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the new program, companies can use the plug-in system to deploy pre-built agents to help with common enterprise tasks, including financial research and engineering specifications. The result is a major opportunity to grow Anthropic’s enterprise client base — and a significant threat to SaaS products currently performing those functions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe that the future of work means everybody having their own custom agent,” Anthropic product officer Matt Piccolella told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the enterprise agents program draws on previously announced technology, particularly Claude Cowork and the plugin system, which was announced in research preview <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/anthropic-brings-agentic-plugins-to-cowork/\">on January 30th</a>. The systems launched today are largely focused on making those tools easier to deploy within a company, including private software marketplaces, controlled data flows, and customized plugins. The result is a system for deploying Claude-powered agents with the same controls a corporate IT department would expect when deploying software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Admins want to be able to have really, really, really tailored workflows and skills for their specific organization,” Piccolella said. “And this allows the admin of a Claude Cowork organization to be able to do this in a very centralized way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stock plugins included at launch take aim at particular departments present within most companies, including agents designed for finance, legal, and HR departments. Each plugin includes basic skills common across different companies, although Anthropic expects that companies will modify each plugin to bring it in line with unique needs and customs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of finance, the stock plugin gives Claude the basic information and data flows necessary to perform market and competitive research, financial modeling, and other common tasks for finance teams. The HR plugin includes skills for generating job descriptions, onboarding materials, and offer letters, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch also includes a number of new enterprise connectors, including integrations for Gmail, DocuSign, and Clay, among others. Previously unavailable, these connectors will allow agents to pull in data and context directly from the linked system. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

There are multiple types of royalties, and artists need to make sure that their data is updated across all platforms so they don’t miss out on potential earnings. For them, making sure that they have all the information in the right place while maintaining creative output is a tiresome task.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mogul, a platform founded by former SoundCloud head of creators Jeff Ponchick and former SoundCloud VP of engineering Joey Mason, announced Tuesday that it has helped artists track $1.5 billion in lost royalties since its launch last year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also raised $5 million in a new round of funding led by the Yamaha Music Innovations Fund with participation from the Urban Innovation Fund, Mindset Ventures, and Fairway Capital Partners, alongside existing investors Amplify LA and Wonder Ventures. The company has raised more than $6.3 million in funding to date. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mogul currently has six people on staff, and plans to grow the team with the funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Kahn, managing partner at Yamaha Music Innovations Fund, believes that Mogul’s founding team has the credentials and experience to ship products that can help artists manage their careers better. He noted that Mogul’s product advantage lies in its data layer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe that Mogul has built the most comprehensive, first-party data pipeline that exists for residual income earners,” Kahn told TechCrunch over email. “Most companies that we have looked into in this space purport to have robust coverage when in actuality, they have limited connectivity to payers. This means that Mogul can be trusted for both accuracy and speed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since Mogul opened last year, its product has evolved. While it earlier gave users only a list of recommendations for better cataloguing, the company now offers more actionable insights, including better formats for lists, and cross-platform corrections to catalog data in some instances.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For example, Sound Exchange is an entity that collects royalties for digital performance for when your music gets played on Sirius XM,” Ponchick said. “If your Sound Exchange is linked, we’ll say, hey, we see you distributed these songs through Distrokid to Spotify, half of them are not in your Sound Exchange account.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He noted that if there is missing information, the tool can ask the user and then complete the registration for them. The company has added a bulk registration tool as well to add data to a source in mass quantities. Ponchick noted that on average, users have seen 20% bump in their royalty revenues by using Mogul.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096086\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png 1724w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=768,584 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=680,517 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=1200,912 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=1280,973 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=430,327 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=720,547 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=900,684 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=800,608 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=1536,1167 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=668,508 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=494,375 494w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=812,617 812w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=699,531 699w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Mogul</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also rolled out a catalog valuation tool that can give an estimation of an artist’s catalog value across recording and publishing. The tool breaks down valuations by individual tracks and revenue sources such as Spotify and Apple Music. Ponchick said that the core thesis is to help artists manage and monetize their catalog better.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company earlier had a free tier, but it was not sustainable for the startup to offer automation tools at that tier, according to Ponchick, adding that a lot of musicians who were starting out or didn’t earn much royalties were using that tier, and long-term, Mogul wasn’t useful for them. To focus on providing more value to artists, the company got rid of its free tiers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The platform is also thinking about how to tackle complexitiy of AI-generated music for tracking royalties. Ponchick noted that performing rights organizations allow registration of music partially created with AI, but fully AI-generated music might face scrutiny on certain platforms. Yamaha Music Innovations Fund’s Kahn said tracking AI music will bring challenges like volume complexity, ownership ambiguity, and attribution disputes in royalty tracking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The current infrastructure was built for a human creator ecosystem. High volume, probabilistic authorship could make tracking, allocating, and defending claims to IP and royalties more difficult,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mogul is currently playing a waiting game to see how the regulatory landscape plays out. Ponchick said that despite this, the company is well-positioned to track royalties for any kind of tracks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mogul is competing with other platforms in the area, including Notes.fm and Claimity. Things are changing at the structural level, too. The U.S. performing rights organization <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://completemusicupdate.com/us-pro-alltrack-launches-mechanical-royalties-collection-service/\">AllTrack launched a new division in 2024</a>, allowing creators to collect performance and mechanical royalties from one place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Real-world data drawn from the vehicles’ onboard computers shows that’s often not the case.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using that data, the Fraunhofer Institute could determine how much of that energy came from charging when plugged in. It <a href=\"https://www.oeko.de/fileadmin/oekodoc/Analyse_PHEV_2025_EN_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">found that</a> less than a third of 1 million PHEVs in Germany plugged in either occasionally or not at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. automakers that are pushing future PHEV models as appealing alternatives for American drivers should take note. By blending gas with electricity, these automakers hope to boost fleet-wide efficiency without a wide rollout of EVs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re looking to make CO<sub>2</sub> reductions across our lineup, but we’re doing it in a very efficient way,” Ford CEO Jim Farley <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s205.q4cdn.com/882619693/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Ford-Q4-2025-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf\">said this month</a> in an earnings call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet the new study shows that PHEVs seldom deliver on their efficiency promises.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At best, Toyota drivers used electricity for 44% of the energy used for driving, suggesting they plugged in the most frequently. The worst? Porsche drivers, at just 0.8%, an average of 7 kilowatt-hours over two years. In other words, the average Porsche PHEV driver charged their battery less than 50% of its capacity — once.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Studies have previously shown that PHEVs produce about <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/771963/phev-emissions-five-times-higher-official/\">3.5 times more emissions</a> than their official ratings would suggest. This new study explains why since it directly assesses how much electricity the vehicles gained from charging. (PHEVs, like all hybrids, can operate in a mixed mode, using both gas and electricity. The study used data straight off the vehicles to disentangle the two.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of PHEV’s many shortcomings are their anemic batteries, capable of powering the vehicle for short distances. Some can only traverse a handful of miles, while many sold in recent years can operate on battery power for about 20 to30 miles. Regulators in Europe and automakers have been proposing longer ranges for future models, hoping that a more capable battery will encourage people to charge their batteries more frequently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not guaranteed, though. The vehicles are likely to remain compromised when driving on electrons. That’s because most PHEVs are based on fossil fuel platforms — the electric motors and power electronics aren’t capable of delivering 100% of the vehicle’s power needs. When a driver floors it, the gas engine has to kick in. In other vehicles, the engine turns on in cold weather to heat the cabin. When that happens, “why bother plugging in” is apparently a question most PHEV drivers have asked themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Which raises another question: why bother with PHEVs at all?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PHEVs have been touted as a way to ease cautious consumers into full EVs. The argument goes something like this: Drivers will become habituated with plugging in while EV charging networks are built out. By the time they’re ready for their next vehicle, the networks will be ready and customers can ease into an EV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if nobody is plugging in their PHEVs, they’re definitely not developing the habit. Without full charges, the electric drivetrain isn’t benefitting anyone. The public still suffer from worse air pollution; and drivers are carting around hundreds of pounds of weight and enduring <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/777965/stellantis-jeep-plug-in-hybrid-fire-recall/\">more recalls</a> and costlier service visits as a result of the complex drivetrain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tweaking the PHEV formula to make them more reliant on batteries could help. The interim solution is called an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), and it’s designed to run on battery power until the charge is depleted, at which point the fossil fuel engine recharges it. So far, no EREV has required the owner to plug in — they could easily drive the vehicle for its lifetime on gas. BMW used to make an EREV in the i3, but it stopped production years ago. Ford and Stellantis have both announced EREV pickup trucks, which have yet to go on sale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, EV charging networks <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/785615/america-ev-fast-charging-record-2025/\">continue to expand</a>. It’s possible that by the time automakers are making PHEVs and EREVs in large quantities, drivers will no longer need a comfort blanket in the form of a gas engine. (My household came to that conclusion two years ago. After a decade split between a BMW i3 EREV and a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid PHEV, we traded up for a Kia EV9.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Legacy automakers, which have second guessed their electrification strategies more times than I care to count, could be forced to change tacks once more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PHEVs might have been a nifty solution on paper, but they’ve failed to deliver in the real world. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

New Relic is no different. As the data observability company launches an AI agent platform of its own, it knows it isn’t the only game in town.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New Relic on Tuesday unveiled a no-code agentic platform that lets enterprises put together data observability AI agents that monitor a company’s data to catch bugs and issues before they disrupt products. Called New Relic Agentic Platform, it lets companies deploy pre-built agents and manage existing bots as well. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also supports the model context protocol (MCP), which connects AI applications to external data sources, and integrates with other New Relic tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New Relic isn’t looking to be the only platform that companies use to manage and deploy all of their AI agents, Brian Emerson, the startup’s new chief product officer, told TechCrunch. Instead, the aim is to offer clients the same agent-building capabilities they are getting elsewhere for observability as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not building this as general purpose,” Emerson said. “We’re building it for outcomes that we care about inside observability. It’s also a world that allows us to work with the rest of the ecosystem or tools that exist out there, but bring it back into the context of problems we’re trying to solve around our personas and the observability domain.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Software that lets users manage AI agents has proliferated in recent months as companies look to figure out how to quell enterprises’ fears about giving AI agents access to their data and software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce was arguably the first to release an agent platform in late 2024, calling it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/salesforce-announces-agentforce-360-as-enterprise-ai-competition-heats-up/\">Agentforce</a>. OpenAI launched its own version of the technology, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-a-way-for-enterprises-to-build-and-manage-ai-agents/\">OpenAI Frontier</a>, earlier this year. Research organization Gartner has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.parloa.com/guides-ebooks-and-reports/gartner-ai-agent-sprawl/\">called</a> such agent platforms “necessary infrastructure” and a critical component of getting enterprises to adopt AI.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sticking with the theme of increasing enterprise tech adoption, New Relic also revealed new tools focused on OpenTelemetry (OTel), an open-source observability framework.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said its application performance monitoring (APM) agents are now equipped with OTel capabilities, letting enterprises manage OTel data streams alongside their other data sources in one place. This is aimed at solving a previous fragmentation problem that was holding up mass enterprise adoption of the OTel framework.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just send your OTel data to us,” Nic Benders, chief technology strategist at New Relic, said. “What we’ve discovered in this process is that it’s kind of a burden for a lot of teams out there in the world to run all of the OTel [data] collectors. So having a OTel like fleet management is something that’s very important.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Select riders who have downloaded the Waymo app will receive an invitation to take their first rides, starting Tuesday. New riders will be added on a rolling basis, and eventually anyone who downloads the app will be able to hail a ride.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The addition of the new cities adds a striking dimension to Waymo’s fast-paced push to expand. Last February, Waymo was operating commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix and some of its surrounding suburbs, parts of Los Angeles, and San Francisco. At the time, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo was providing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/waymo-has-doubled-its-weekly-robotaxi-rides-in-less-than-a-year/\">more than 200,000 rides</a> every week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past 12 months, Waymo has expanded in its existing markets, particularly in San Francisco, where its service area now <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.google.com/waymo/answer/9059119?hl=en\">stretches down Highway 101</a> through numerous towns, all the way to San Jose. It now has access to three airports, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-sfo-airport-robotaxis/\">San Francisco International</a>. It has launched a service in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/uber-users-in-austin-are-getting-matched-with-waymo-robotaxis/\">partnership with Uber</a> in Atlanta and Austin. It has expanded its operating domain <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-giving-rides-on-freeways-in-these-3-cities/\">to freeways</a> in three cities. And last month it opened its robotaxi service to the public <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/waymo-continues-robotaxi-ramp-up-with-miami-service-now-open-to-public/\">in Miami</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo tends to hold back on its latest ridership numbers. The last time it provided an update, Waymo said it was providing more than <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2026/02/waymo-raises-usd16-billion-investment-round\">400,000</a> rides per week, though the actual number is likely higher by now. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo doesn’t appear to be slowing down, either. It is planning to launch robotaxi services in several more cities this year, including Denver, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/waymo-plans-to-launch-a-robotaxi-service-in-london-in-2026/\">London</a>, and Washington, D.C., to name a few. And it is now armed with an additional <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/waymo-raises-16-billion-round-to-scale-robotaxi-fleet-london-tokyo/\">$16 billion</a> raised in round led by Dragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital that values Waymo at $126 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo currently has a fleet of about 3,000 robotaxis that are spread across its six markets of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. That fleet size will likely grow with the addition of these four new cities, but don’t expect it to balloon immediately.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli said it will have dozens of vehicles to start in these cities, and will scale up in coordination with riders over the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s workforce will also scale alongside this expansion. The staff who monitor the robotaxis and respond to specific requests for information from the Waymo self-driving system — for instance, if a robotaxi encounters a tricky scenario on public roads — may expand, although Waymo wouldn’t share specifics. The company said only that it has an extensive planning process to ensure that its operations are right-sized to its scale as it grows. Waymo recently revealed it employs about 70 of these workers, whom it describes as remote assistance workers, or RAs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this is pushing toward a lofty goal Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana laid out last year — and one that hasn’t changed even as the company faces increased scrutiny and investigations by safety regulators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation after one of Waymo’s robotaxis last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-robotaxi-hits-a-child-near-an-elementary-school-in-santa-monica/\">struck a child</a> at 6 miles per hour near a school in Santa Monica. The National Transportation Safety Board is also examining how Waymo robotaxis <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/\">behave around school buses</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Waymo is serving more riders than ever, as we are on track to serve over one million rides per week by the end of this year,” said Mawakana <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2026/02/dallas-houston-san-antonio-orlando\">said in a blog post </a>Tuesday, adding that the company is laying the groundwork for robotaxi service in more than 20 cities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Believe it or not, web search is still thriving as an industry. As businesses invest in using AI agents to make the most of their data, there’s demand for tools that not only scrape the web to inform what those AI bots do, but also return those results in a way that’s easier to use with modern data tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the promise behind web search startup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nimbleway.com/\">Nimble</a>, which recently raised a $47 million Series B round, led by Norwest. The New York company’s platform employs AI agents to search the web in real time, verify, and validate the results, and then structure the information into neat tables that can then be queried like a database.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That last part is crucial here. LLMs and AI agents are great for searching the web, connecting results from a variety of sources, and analyzing them, but they often return the results in plain text, which can be difficult to work with at an enterprise level. And that’s before you factor in hallucinations, the risk of the agent misunderstanding your instructions, or the use of unreliable sources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By validating and structuring results into tables, Nimble lets companies use web data as if it were already part of their existing databases. The startup also integrates with enterprise data warehouses and data lakes — large centralized repositories where businesses store and analyze data — offered by the likes of Databricks and Snowflake. That means its AI agents can plug into a business’s trove of data, using it to build context, and shape how search results are structured and returned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In effect, this lets enterprises have live, structured web data as part of their existing data environments, Nimble CEO and co-founder Uri Knorovich (pictured above, middle) told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such integrations also allow Nimble’s software to remember constraints — such as how you want the search to be performed, or which data sources to tap. This is particularly useful for applications such as competitor analysis, pricing research, know-your-customer (KYC) processes, brand monitoring, deep research, and financial analysis. (Knorovich noted that Nimble works to ensure all customer data remains within customers’ data infrastructure to comply with data retention and security policies.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To that end, the startup has partnered with Databricks, Snowflake, AWS and Microsoft to help streamline enterprise deployments that require access to internal data sources. (Databricks also participated in this Series B.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Models can do a lot of things, but most production AI fails aren’t because the models are not good enough — it’s because of a data failure,” Knorovich said. “What we’re seeing today is that enterprises don’t need more AI; they need AI with good, reliable web search […] If you nail it down, if you can choose what your agent can search and cannot search, this is the tipping point for enterprises to say, ‘hey we can actually trust AI. We can actually put AI to work in more use cases’.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Knorovich says the ability to search the web in real time at scale, and validate and structure search results, is what sets Nimble apart from other data brokers already in the space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently has more than 100 customers, with the majority of its revenue coming from large enterprises, Fortune 500 companies, and even some Fortune 10 companies, including major retailers, hedge funds, banks, and consumer packaged goods companies, as well as some AI-native startups.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nimble is tackling a problem that has existed for years without a proper solution and is now becoming of critical urgency,” Assaf Harel, partner at Norwest, said in a statement. “Trusted live web data is increasingly becoming a prerequisite for AI agents performing critical business decisions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series B also saw participation from returning investors Target Global, Square Peg, Hetz Ventures, Slow Ventures, R-Squared Ventures, J-Ventures, and InvestInData. Proceeds from the round will be used to expand R&amp;D in multi-agent web search and a governed data layer that processes and validates search results. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nimble has now raised a total of $75 million.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The investment comes as the company works to carve out a position in cross-border B2B payments, a market still dominated by banks and manual processes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series A round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from existing investors Square Peg, Stripe, Lightspeed, and Moore Capital, while PayPal Ventures joined as a new backer. The all-equity round values the Bengaluru-based startup at $85 million post-investment and brings its total funding to more than $32 million to date.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/07/india-stack-financial-access-and-digital-inclusion.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rapid digitization in domestic payments</a>, cross-border B2B transfers for Indian exporters <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/business/news/fintechs-eye-gains-as-rbi-opens-cross-border-payments/4076880/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remain heavily reliant on banks</a>, often with limited visibility into fees, settlement timelines, and the final amount received in rupees. The friction is particularly acute for larger exporters moving millions of dollars into India to fund salaries and local operations, creating an opening for fintech infrastructure players such as Xflow that promise greater transparency and speed in international money movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2021, Xflow provides cross-border payment infrastructure for businesses ranging from exporters and SaaS firms to platforms and freelancers, enabling them to collect international payments, manage foreign exchange, and settle funds in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Cross-border B2B payments were stuck in a different age compared to UPI,” co-founder Anand Balaji (pictured above, center) said in an interview, referring to India’s widely used instant domestic payments network, the Unified Payments Interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Balaji, who previously helped build out Stripe’s India business, founded Xflow with former Stripe colleagues Ashwin Bhatnagar (pictured above, right) and Abhijit Chandrasekaran (pictured above, left).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Xflow said it enabled Indian businesses to collect payments from more than 100 countries in over 25 currencies. It processed close to $1 billion in annualized cross-border payment volume last year, marking roughly 10-fold growth from the same period in 2024, Balaji told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the company, its customer base has expanded to about 15,000 businesses spanning SaaS firms, global capability centers (which are offshore units that multinationals operate in India), IT services exporters, freelancers, and fintech platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Transaction sizes vary widely by segment, with global capability centers averaging about $1 million to $2 million per transaction, goods exporters around $30,000 to $40,000, and freelancers roughly $3,000, according to Balaji.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xflow is positioning itself as a payments infrastructure provider rather than a direct payments application, offering APIs that allow platforms and exporters to embed cross-border money movement into their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We didn’t want to build the next Wise — we want to power the next thousand Wises,” Balaji said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has also introduced an AI-based foreign exchange tool to help finance teams optimize the timing of currency conversions. Xflow says the feature has generated incremental gains for some customers through data-driven foreign exchange decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool allows businesses to set target conversion rates rather than accepting prevailing bank quotes. Balaji likened the feature to limit orders in trading — instructions to buy or sell only at a specified price.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’ve added is the prediction layer and the ability to actually set a limit order,” he said. The model currently provides a three-day forecast with about 92% confidence, Balaji said, though TechCrunch could not independently verify that figure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xflow faces competition from banks that still dominate large cross-border B2B transfers, as well as fintech players such as Wise, Payoneer, and Skydo at the lower end of the market. But Balaji said the startup’s focus on high-value transactions and API-led infrastructure differentiates it from many rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup plans to deploy the new capital toward building additional products on top of its core payments infrastructure and securing regulatory licenses in new markets, Balaji said. Xflow is preparing to roll out import capabilities in the coming months and is pursuing licenses in markets including Singapore, while already holding a payments license in Canada, even as it remains focused on India as its primary market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xflow said it has also received final authorization from the Reserve Bank of India for a Payment Aggregator–Cross Border (PA-CB) license covering both exports and imports. The startup has signed platform partnerships with Easebuzz and Drip Capital to embed its cross-border capabilities into their offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Backing from Stripe and PayPal Ventures, Balaji said, has helped strengthen the startup’s credibility with banking and regulatory partners, even as it continues to work with multiple payment providers commercially.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently has about 65 employees as it scales its cross-border infrastructure business.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

She told her OpenClaw AI agent to check her overstuffed email inbox and suggest what to delete or archive.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agent proceeded to run amok. It started deleting all her email in a “speed run” while ignoring her commands from her phone telling it to stop. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb,” she wrote, posting images of the ignored stop prompts as receipts.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Mac Mini, an affordable Apple computer that sits flat on a desk and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/apple-mac-mini-m4-review-more-power-in-a-tiny-package/\">fits in the palm of your hand</a>, has become the favored device these days for running OpenClaw. (The Mini is selling “like hotcakes,” one “confused” Apple employee apparently told <a href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/2024987174077432126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">famed AI researcher Andrej Karpathy</a> when he bought one to run an OpenClaw alternative called NanoClaw.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/openclaw-creator-peter-steinberger-joins-openai/\">OpenClaw</a> is, of course, the open source AI agent that achieved fame through Moltbook, an AI-only social network. OpenClaw agents were at the center of that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/after-all-the-hype-some-ai-experts-dont-think-openclaw-is-all-that-exciting/\">now largely debunked episode</a> on Moltbook in which it looked like the AIs were plotting against humans.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But OpenClaw’s mission, according to its <a href=\"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GitHub page</a>, is not focused on social networks. It aims to be a personal AI assistant that runs on your own devices.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Silicon Valley in-crowd has fallen so in love with OpenClaw that “claw” and “claws” have become the <a href=\"https://x.com/simonw/status/2024999368982757509\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">buzzwords of choice</a> for agents that run on personal hardware.

Y Combinator’s podcast team even appeared on their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8wVMdwhlh4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most recent episode</a> dressed in lobster costumes. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Yue’s post serves as a warning. As others on X noted, if an AI security researcher could run into this problem, what hope do mere mortals have? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?” a software developer asked her on X.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Rookie mistake tbh,” she replied. She had been testing her agent with a smaller “toy” inbox, as she called it, and it had been running well on less important email. It had earned her trust, so she thought she’d let it loose on the real thing. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yue believes that the large amount of data in her real inbox “triggered compaction,” she wrote. Compaction happens when the context window — the running record of everything the AI has been told and has done in a session — grows too large, causing the agent to begin summarizing, compressing, and managing the conversation.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that point, the AI may skip over instructions that the human considers quite important.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this case, it may have skipped her last prompt — where she told it not to act — and reverted back to its instructions from the “toy” inbox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As several others <a href=\"https://x.com/isik5/status/2025920413700641132\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on X pointed out</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/mikedelta221/status/2025936657396985983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prompts can’t be trusted</a> to act as security guardrails. Models may misconstrue or ignore them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Various people offered suggestions that ranged from the exact syntax Yue should have used to stop the agent, to various methods to ensure better adherence to guardrails, like writing instructions to dedicated files or using other open source tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the interest of full transparency, TechCrunch could not independently verify what happened to Yue’s inbox. (She didn’t respond to our request for comment, though she did respond to many questions and comments sent her way on X.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it doesn’t really matter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The point of the tale is that agents aimed at knowledge workers, at their current stage of development, are risky. People who say they are using them successfully are cobbling together methods to protect themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One day, perhaps soon (by 2027? 2028?), they may be ready for widespread use. Goodness knows many of us would love help with email, grocery orders, and scheduling dentist appointments. But that day has not yet come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The state DMV ruled that Tesla used deceptive marketing to overstate the automated driving capabilities of its vehicles, thereby violating state law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit reignites an issue that appeared to be resolved last week when the DMV said it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/tesla-dodges-30-day-suspension-in-california-after-removing-autopilot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">would not</a> suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days. This was because the EV maker complied with the ruling and stopped using the term “Autopilot” in its California marketing materials. CNBC was first to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/tesla-sues-california-dmv-to-reverse-false-advertising-ruling-on-fsd.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report the lawsuit</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV could have taken action against Tesla. It chose not to even though an administrative law judge agreed with the DMV’s request to suspend Tesla’s licenses for 30 days as a penalty. Instead of pulling its licenses, the state regulator gave Tesla 60 days to comply. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Tesla did, although in the most extreme ways. Tesla didn’t just stop using the term Autopilot; in January it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tesla-discontinues-autopilot-in-bid-to-boost-adoption-of-its-full-self-driving-software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">discontinued Autopilot</a> altogether in the U.S. and Canada.

These include D1, Fidelity, and TPG.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of these was a bit shocking. Affiliated funds of BlackRock joined in Anthropic’s $30 billion raise even though BlackRock’s senior managing director and board member <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/openai-appoints-blackrock-exec-to-its-board/\">Adebayo Ogunlesi</a> is also on OpenAI’s board of directors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that world, it’s true that if various BlackRock funds get a chance to own OpenAI stock, they are likely to take it, never mind the personal association of a member of their senior leadership. (BlackRock runs every type of fund, including mutuals, closed-ends, and ETFs). And we all know the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/the-cracks-in-the-openai-microsoft-relationship-are-reportedly-widening/\">history of OpenAI and Microsoft’s relationship</a> and why Microsoft is hedging its bets. Ditto for Nvidia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But venture capital funds have — until now — operated differently. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">VCs market themselves as “founder friendly” and “helpful,” the idea being that when a VC firm buys a chunk of a startup’s company, the investor will help that startup be successful, particularly against its major rivals. If you are an owner of both OpenAI and Anthropic, who does your loyalty belong to, besides your own investors?  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, startups are private companies. They typically share confidential information with their direct investors on their business status — data that isn’t disclosed publicly the way it is with public companies. In many cases, the VCs also take board seats, which carries another level of fiduciary responsibility to their portfolio companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What makes this particular case even more interesting is that Sam Altman comes from the world of venture capital, as a former president of Y Combinator. He knows the drill. In 2024, he reportedly gave his investors <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-tells-investor-not-invest-five-ai-startups-including-sutskevers-ssi-2024-10-02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a list of OpenAI’s rivals</a> that he didn’t want them to back. It largely included companies launched by folks who left OpenAI, including Anthropic, xAI, and Safe Superintelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman later denied that he told OpenAI investors they would be barred from future rounds if they backed his list of perceived rivals. Altman did admit that he said if they “made non-passive investments,” they would no longer receive OpenAI’s confidential business information, according to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/\">documents in the lawsuit</a> between Elon Musk and OpenAI, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-denies-musk-claim-openai-investors-ban-rivals-2025-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Business Insider reported</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI is also breaking the mold because of the record-breaking amounts of money that the largest AI labs are raising as they experience never-before-seen growth (and never-before-seen data center needs). At some point, when the hat is being passed around, the needs are so great and the possibilities of returns are so large, who can be expected to say no? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It turns out that not all venture investors have yet slid down the slippery slope. Andreessen Horowitz backs OpenAI but not (yet) Anthropic. Menlo Ventures backs Anthropic but not (yet) OpenAI, for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, in our admittedly not exhaustive research, we found a dozen investors that appear to only have direct investments in one of these companies, not both. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others include Bessemer Venture Partners, General Catalyst, and Greenoaks. (Note: We originally asked Claude to give us the list of dual investors. It got almost as many entries wrong as it got right, so all this for a very cool tech whose work sometimes remains less trustworthy than an intern’s.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, as we previously reported, the fact that this longstanding rule has been tossed by some of the most respected firms in the Valley, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/sequoia-to-invest-in-anthropic-breaking-vc-taboo-on-backing-rivals-ft/\">like Sequoia, is notable</a>. One investor we reached out to simply shrugged and said that as long as the firm doesn’t have a board seat, no one sees the harm in it anymore.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, conflict-of-interest policies should now become another thing that founders ask about before signing that term sheet, no matter who it’s from. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Acme Weather</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Forecasts are often wrong — it’s the weather, right? It’s one of the hardest things to predict,” Grossman told TechCrunch via a telephone interview. “And our biggest pet peeve with a lot of weather apps is you just get their best guess, and you don’t know how certain they are.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Having an understanding of the alternatives helps people plan for big events, he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I find it most useful for winter storms, where, maybe the storm starts out in the morning, and you’re going to get snow, but maybe there’s also a possibility it holds out a little bit later — to the afternoon — in which case it’s rain,” Gross explained. “Being able to just see that right there on the timeline just gives you this intuitive sense of whether, do all the models agree, and you’re getting snow? Or do half of them say snow and half of them say rain?” he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This type of weather data could make for a valuable product, not just for consumers, but for other developers, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Dark Sky, the team had offered its weather API to developers for a fee. After being acquired by Apple, the team worked on creating <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WeatherKit</a>, the developer toolkit that provides access to Apple’s weather data on a subscription basis. Grossman said the team hasn’t yet decided if a developer API will be a part of Acme Weather’s offering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, Acme Weather is a $25-per-year consumer app, with a two-week free trial. This helps to cover the costs involved with pulling in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://acmeweather.com/datasources\">different weather models and resources</a>, which can be expensive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of our time has been spent on building our own forecast — our own data provider, in a way. And this lets us do things like build multiple forecasts … [and] create any map we want, rather than having to rely on a third-party map provider,” Grossman noted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, the app offers a range of maps, like radar, lightning, rain and snow totals, as well as wind, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and hurricane tracks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another feature, Community Reports, lets users share information about their current conditions to improve the app’s real-time weather reporting. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095737\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png 1290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=300,249 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=768,637 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=680,564 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=1200,995 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=1280,1062 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=430,357 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=720,597 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=900,747 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=800,664 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=668,554 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=452,375 452w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=744,617 744w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=640,531 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Acme Weather</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Dark Sky had become a favorite weather app because of its uncanny ability to predict when it would begin raining in your location, Acme Weather aims to improve on this and even have some fun. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app includes built-in notifications for typical things, like rain, nearby lightning, community reports, government-issued severe weather alerts, and more.

OpenAI sent a memo to House lawmakers earlier this month accusing DeepSeek of using distillation to mimic its products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepSeek first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/how-deepseek-changed-silicon-valleys-ai-landscape/\">made waves</a> a year ago when it released its open source R1 reasoning model that nearly matched American frontier labs in performance at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek is expected to soon release DeepSeek V4, its latest model, which <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> can outperform Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in coding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scale of each attack differed in scope. Anthropic tracked more than 150,000 exchanges from DeepSeek that seemed aimed at improving foundational logic and alignment, specifically around censorship-safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moonshot AI had more than 3.4 million exchanges targeting agentic reasoning and tool use, coding and data analysis, computer-use agent development, and computer vision. Last month, the firm <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/chinas-moonshot-releases-a-new-open-source-model-kimi-k2-5-and-a-coding-agent/\">released</a> a new open source model Kimi K2.5 and a coding agent.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MiniMax’s 13 million exchanges targeted agentic coding and tool use and orchestration. Anthropic said it was able to observe MiniMax in action as it redirected nearly half its traffic to siphon capabilities from the latest Claude model when it was launched. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says it will continue to invest in defenses that make distillation attacks harder to execute and easier to identify, but is calling on “a coordinated response across the AI industry, cloud providers, and policymakers.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The distillation attacks come at a time when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/a-timeline-of-the-u-s-semiconductor-market-in-2025/\">American chip exports</a> to China are still hotly debated. Last month, the Trump administration formally allowed U.S. companies like Nvidia to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/department-of-commerce-may-approve-nvidia-h200-chip-exports-to-china/\">export advanced AI chips </a>(like the H200) to China. Critics have argued that this loosening of export controls increases China’s AI computing capacity at a critical time in the global race for AI dominance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says that the scale of extraction DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot performed “requires access to advanced chips.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,” per Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-and-preventing-distillation-attacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/crowdstrikes-former-cto-on-cyber-rivalries-and-how-automation-can-undermine-security-for-early-stage-startups/\">Dmitri Alperovitch</a>, chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think-tank and co-founder and former CTO of CrowdStrike, told TechCrunch he’s not surprised to see these attacks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s been clear for a while now that part of the reason for the rapid progress of Chinese AI models has been theft via distillation of U.S. frontier models. Now we know this for a fact,” Alperovitch said. “This should give us even more compelling reasons to refuse to sell any AI chips to any of these [companies], which would only advantage them further.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic also said distillation doesn’t only threaten to undercut American AI dominance, but could also create national security risks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anthropic and other U.S. companies build systems that prevent state and non-state actors from using AI to, for example, develop bioweapons or carry out malicious cyber activities,” reads Anthropic’s blog post. “Models built through illicit distillation are unlikely to retain those safeguards, meaning that dangerous capabilities can proliferate with many protections stripped out entirely.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic pointed to authoritarian governments deploying frontier AI for things like “offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance,” a risk that is multiplied if those models are open sourced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot for comment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to clarify Dmitri Alperovitch was formerly CTO of Crowdstrike. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Uber has backed many of these companies — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/uber-makes-multi-million-dollar-investment-in-lucid-nuro-to-build-robotaxi-service/\">Lucid and Nuro</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/waabi-raises-1b-and-expands-into-robotaxis-with-uber/\">Waabi</a>, and China’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/uber-invests-100m-in-weride-to-fuel-robotaxi-expansion-across-15-more-cities/\">WeRide</a> — invested $100 million to build fast-charging, autonomous-vehicle charging stations, and even launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/uber-launches-an-av-labs-division-to-gather-driving-data-for-robotaxi-partners/\">Uber AV Labs</a>, a specialized engineering team that will gather data for robotaxi partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has made the partnerships and investments; now it wants to make itself indispensable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AV tech teams should be able to focus on what they do best: building software that can safely power an autonomous world,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s global head of autonomous mobility and delivery, who will be leading the initiative. The idea, he said, is to add “operational depth wherever they need it,” including demand generation, rider experience, customer support, or managing the day-to-day fleet operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end goal is to help these companies reduce their costs per mile and increase the speed to market. Uber said it plans to help these partners scale robotaxi deployments to <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/J3LNCnGAzAhnrM2GcEuLIJqIJU?domain=s23.q4cdn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 15 cities by the end of this year</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What’s going to determine the success or failure of autonomous in the world is whether it can be commercialized, and Uber is going to be the thing that makes autonomy commercially viable,” Uber President and COO Andrew MacDonald said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Uber that means handling infrastructure like training data and mapping, fleet financing, regulatory services, and managing how robotaxis and other AVs navigate complex events and venues. The company said it is using a fleet of specially equipped Lucid vehicles to collect data that can be shared with partners so they can train their AI systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new division also plans to tackle user experience, including customer support. Notably, Uber wants to take over fleet management, which would include remote assistance — an issue that recently received attention from federal lawmakers over concerns <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/22/techcrunch-mobility-waymo-makes-its-defense/\">Waymo uses workers overseas</a>. Fleet management would also cover insurance and employing the humans who might need to support these AVs when they’re out in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber’s move is both existential and opportunistic. The company sold its in-house AV development unit known as Uber ATG in 2020, following two years of internal struggles and pressure after one of its test vehicles killed a pedestrian. (Uber sold off the division in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">complex deal with Aurora</a>.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has tried to shore up its position through partnerships and investments. And there have been plenty. Uber and Waymo have a shared robotaxi service in Atlanta and Austin. The company has also locked up partnerships with Chinese firms Baidu, Momenta, and Pony.ai, sidewalk delivery bot companies Cartken, Starship, and Serve, and the U.K.-based automated driving tech startup Wayve, as well as robotaxi developers AVride and Motional, to name a few. It has plans to launch a robotaxi service with Volkswagen in Los Angeles by the end of 2026 — although it won’t be driverless until 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These do provide Uber with some protection, but it doesn’t provide a replacement to any revenue lost if these companies erode its own ride-hailing and food delivery business that is today powered by human drivers. Uber is hoping this new division will. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It gives him a high-level view of how companies are actually using AI models, and what still needs to be done to unleash the potential of agentic AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I spoke with Gerstenhaber, I was particularly struck by one idea I hadn’t heard before. As he put it, AI models are pushing against three frontiers at once: raw intelligence, response time, and a third quality that has less to do with raw capability than with cost — whether a model can be deployed cheaply enough to run at massive, unpredictable scale. It’s a new way of thinking about model capabilities, and a particularly valuable one for anyone trying to push frontier models in a new direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Why don’t you start by walking us through your experience in AI so far, and what you do at Google.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’ve been in AI for about two years now. I was at Anthropic for a year and a half, I’ve been at Google almost half a year now. I run Vertex AI, Google’s developer platform. Most of our customers are engineers building their own applications. They want access to agentic patterns. They want access to an agentic platform. They want access to the inference of the smartest models in the world. I provide them that, but I don’t provide the applications themselves. That’s for Shopify, Thomson Reuters, and our various customers to provide in their own domains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What drew you to Google?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is I think unique in the world in that we have everything from the interface to the infrastructure layer. We can build data centers. We can buy electricity and build power plants. We have our own chips. We have our own model. We have the inference layer that we control. We have the agentic layer we control. We have APIs for memory, for interleaved code writing. We have an agent engine on top of that that ensures compliance and governance. And then we even have the chat interface with Gemini enterprise and Gemini chat for consumers, right? So part of the reason I came here is because I saw Google as uniquely vertically integrated, and that being a strength for us.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>It’s odd because, even with all the differences between companies, it feels like all three of the big labs are really</strong> <strong>close in capabilities. Is it just a race for more intelligence, or is it more complicated than that?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I see three boundaries. Models like Gemini Pro are tuned for raw intelligence. Think about writing code. You just want the best code you can get, doesn’t matter if it takes 45 minutes, because I have to maintain it, I have to put it in production. I just want the best.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s this other boundary with latency. If I’m doing customer support and I need to know how to apply a policy, you need intelligence to apply that policy. Are you allowed to transact a return? Can I upgrade my seat on an airplane? But it doesn’t matter how right you are if it took 45 minutes to get the answer. So for those cases, you want the most intelligent product within that latency budget, because more intelligence no longer matters once that person gets bored and hangs up the phone. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then there’s this last bucket, where somebody like Reddit or Meta wants to moderate the entire internet. They have large budgets, but they can’t take an enterprise risk on something if they don’t know how it scales. They don’t know how many poisonous posts there will be today or tomorrow. So they have to restrict their budget to a model at the highest intelligence they can afford, but in a scalable way to an infinite number of subjects. And for that, cost becomes very, very important.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>One of the things I’ve been puzzling about is why agentic systems are taking so long to catch on. It feels like the models are there and I’ve seen incredible demos, but we’re not seeing the kind of major changes I would have expected a year ago. What do you think is holding it back?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This technology is basically two years old, and there’s still a lot of missing infrastructure. We don’t have patterns for auditing what the agents are doing. We don’t have patterns for authorization of data to an agent. There are these patterns that are going to require work to put into production. And production is always a trailing indicator of what the technology is capable of. So two years isn’t long enough to see what the intelligence supports in production, and that’s where people are struggling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think it’s moved uniquely quickly in software engineering because it fits nicely in the software development lifecycle. We have a dev environment in which it’s safe to break things, and then we promote from the dev environment to the test environment. The process of writing code at Google requires two people to audit that code and both affirm that it’s good enough to put Google’s brand behind and give to our customers. So we have a lot of those human-in-the-loop processes that make the implementation exceptionally low-risk. But we need to produce those patterns in other places and for other professions.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
