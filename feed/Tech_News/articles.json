The company plans to open offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its current office in New Delhi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership was announced at the ongoing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">India AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi, where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Altman is appearing</a> alongside industry leaders, including Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Google’s Sundar Pichai.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies also plan to extend the partnership to surface JioHotstar recommendations directly within ChatGPT, allowing users who search for entertainment through ChatGPT to receive contextual suggestions and deep links into the platform’s catalogue. The move positions the integration as a two-way discovery layer rather than a standalone in-app feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as streaming and TV platforms increasingly experiment with conversational interfaces. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-debuts-its-generative-ai-powered-search-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Netflix</a> said in May 2025 it was testing a new search experience using OpenAI’s ChatGPT to help viewers find content through natural language, while Google in November introduced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/google-brings-gemini-to-the-google-tv-streamer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gemini-powered discovery features for its Google TV</a> platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fidji Simo, chief executive of applications at OpenAI, said the partnership is aimed at bringing more personalized AI experiences into entertainment and live sports, enabling viewers to move “from curiosity to context” through natural interactions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Embedding AI into content discovery will help reshape how audiences find and engage with programming, said Uday Shankar, vice chairperson of JioStar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rollout will span both live and on-demand formats, the companies said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The JioHotstar partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader “OpenAI for India” push to deepen its presence in the South Asian nation through infrastructure, enterprise, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-pushes-into-higher-education-as-india-seeks-to-scale-ai-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">education partnerships</a>.

Companies like Apple and Qualcomm are in the early stages of making on-device AI more useful. Amid all that, the 14-person technical team of London-based <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://trymirai.com/\">Mirai</a> is working to improve how models run on phones and laptops.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai, which is backed by a $10 million seed round led by Uncork Capital, was founded by Dima Shvets and Alexey Moiseenkov last year. Both founders have experience in building scalable consumer apps. Shevts co-founded face-swapping app Reface, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/reface-grabs-5-5m-seed-led-by-a16z-to-stoke-its-viral-face-swap-video-app/\">which was backed by a16z</a>. Shevts later also became a scout for the venture firm. Moiseenkov was CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/prisma-uses-ai-to-turn-your-photos-into-graphic-novel-fodder-double-quick/\">the last decade’s viral AI filters app, Prisma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As consumer developers, both had been thinking about AI and machine learning on devices even before generative AI became popular, Shvets said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we met together in London, we started to chat about technology, and we realized that within the hype of gen AI and more AI adoption, everybody speaks about cloud, about servers, about AGI coming. But the missing piece is on-device [AI] for consumer hardware,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shevts and Moiseenkov wanted to use AI to create a pipeline that would allow them to enable complex tasks on the phone, which led them to start Mirai. When they asked others who developed consumer apps, they heard that many wanted better cost optimization and margin per token usage, too. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094301\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=430,254 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=720,426 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=900,533 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=800,473 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=668,395 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=634,375 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=1043,617 1043w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=708,419 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Co-founders Alexey Moiseenkov and Dima Shvet Image Credits: Mirai</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Mirai is developing a framework for models so they can perform better on devices. The company has built an inference engine for Apple Silicon that optimizes on-device throughput. With its upcoming SDK, developers can integrate the runtime in their apps with only a few lines, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the visions why we started the company was that we wanted to give developers, like this Stripe-like, eight lines of code [integration] experience…you basically go to our platform, integrate the key, and start working with summarization, classification, or whatever your use case is,” Shevts said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built this engine in Rust, which can bump up a model’s generation speed by up to 37%, they claim. The company said that, while tuning the model for a platform, it doesn’t tinker with model weights to ensure there is no loss in quality of the output.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai’s stack currently focuses on improving text and voice modalities on the platform, with plans to support vision in the future. The team has started to work with frontier model providers to tune their models for edge use and is in talks with different chipmakers. Later, it plans to bring its engine to Android, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Mirai aims to release on-device benchmarks so model makers can test on-device performance. Shevts recognizes that not all AI work can be done on-device, though. To enable a mixed mode of operation, the team is building an orchestration layer to send requests that can’t be fulfilled on the device up to the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the startup is not directly working with apps just yet, its engine could power on-device assistants, transcribers, translators, and chat apps, we’re told.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andy McLoughlin, managing partner at Uncork Capital, noted that he invested in an edge machine learning company in the last decade. He said that the company was early and eventually sold its business to Spotify. In today’s world, the situation is different, he thinks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given the cost of cloud inference, something has to change… For now, VCs are happy to continue funding the rocketship companies, spending inordinate sums on cloud inference. But that won’t last — at some point, people will focus on the underlying economics of these businesses and realize that something has to change,” he said. “It feels like every model maker will want to run part of their inference workloads at the edge, and Mirai feels very well positioned to capture this demand.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai’s seed round also saw participation from individuals, including Dreamer CEO David Singleton, YC Partner Francois Chaubard, Snowflake co-founder Marcin Żukowski, Mati ElevenLabs co-founder Staniszewski, former Google AdSense product manager and Coinbase board member Gokul Rajaram, Groq investor Scooter Braun, Turing.com CTO Vijay Krishnan, Theory Forge Ventures’ Ben Parr and Matt Schlicht, and ex-Netflix technical leader, Aditya Jami.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He took a few stabs at starting new AI businesses, but nothing really stuck until he got a call from a friend who wanted help filling out customs paperwork.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu got “very curious” and started cold-calling customs brokers in the Los Angeles area. He learned that many are mom-and-pop affairs still deeply reliant on fax machines and paper. When his first customer showed him stacks of manila folders during a FaceTime tour of her office, everything clicked, Basu told TechCrunch. He flew to that customer’s office the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That was the eye-opening moment. There’s just papers and papers,” Basu said in a recent interview. “I was both shocked and impressed. Shocked that this is how the industry runs, and impressed that everything around us, from the watch that you’re wearing to the glasses, literally everything that’s imported, and this is what’s happening behind the scenes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This seed of an idea is now called Amari AI, a startup co-founded by Basu and Arushi Vashist, a former senior software engineer at LinkedIn. The pair, and their small team, have already collected more than 30 customers, and helped those firms move more than $15 billion of goods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amari has also raised $4.5 million of funding co-led by preeminent early-stage firms First Round Capital and Pear VC, all before coming out of stealth mode on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu has two goals with Amari. One is to help customs brokers modernize. To date, he said, many of them have done little work to integrate new technologies. Some leverage optical character recognition software to help speed up data entry, but that tech is limited and brittle, he said. Amari is meant to help automate data entry and paperwork, and let employees — who <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-Oct/CBP%20Publication%201847-0622%20-%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Key%20Changes%2019%20CFR%20111%20Final%20Rule.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legally must be in the United States</a>, meaning companies can’t use off-shore workers — focus on helping customers move their goods across the border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s where the second goal comes in. President Donald Trump’s chaotic trade policy has made customs brokers all the more important, according to Chris Bachinski, CEO of 125-year-old firm GHY International. Bachinski — who is one of Amari’s early adopters — told TechCrunch that many of his own customers don’t even have their own compliance staff. Instead, they look to the brokers like GHY to help figure out how sudden changes in trade policy apply to their goods, especially if they are already in transit.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This chaos has led to burnout across the industry, according to Basu. With the employee base tightly regulated, and a <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/customs-brokers/license-examination-notice-examination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">licensing exam pass rate</a> that hovers around 10% to 20%, “it’s a perfect fit for AI,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Experienced people are leaving the industry or taking early retirement,” Basu said. “So we’re pitching ourselves as these extra set of hands that logistics companies can hire or keep alongside the human expertise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu said Amari’s AI agents constantly monitor trade rules and update their reasoning any time there’s a change, making it easier for brokers to help their customers quickly understand any impact. Previously, these kinds of sudden changes required manual research that would slow down brokers’ ability to clear cargo into the country.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amari does this by building its own AI models trained on more than one million documents related to the shipments it’s already helped clear through customs, though Basu said the company has been leveraging off-the-shelf models to date. He noted some customers do opt out of this training, and that Amari anonymizes the data before feeding it to the models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do not sell their data, and we make sure that their data is theirs,” he said. “They’re very serious about these documents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Todd Jackson, a partner at First Round Capital, attributed Amari’s early success to Basu’s willingness to pound the pavement in order to learn what these brokers need.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He’s going to conferences, he’s going to trade shows, [and] the word of mouth starts to get very strong,” Jackson said in an interview. “It’s an old-school industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was at one of these trade shows — the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, to be precise — that one of Basu’s presentations caught Bachinski’s eye. GHY International is not a mom-and-pop, but it’s also not a Fortune 500 like FedEx; Bachinski has been looking for ways to both stay competitive and grow his company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bachinski said the biggest concern amongst GHY employees so far has been job loss. But he’s told them not to worry. He said he expects tech like Amari’s to help GHY grow, and to focus more on the customer relationships and compliance work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s an old industry, and technology is going to shift our industry faster than I think most customs brokers understand,” he said. And with trade now constantly in the spotlight, he said brokers need to be agile. “I make this joke that last year, the first time in history, our families know what we do for a living. Because all of a sudden, custom brokers became very, very important.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A world that runs on increasingly powerful AI coding tools is one where software creation is cheap — or so the thinking goes — leaving little room for traditional software companies. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.forrester.com/blogs/saas-as-we-know-it-is-dead-how-to-survive-the-saas-pocalypse/\">As one analyst report</a> put it, “vibe coding will allow startups to replicate the features of complex SaaS platforms.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cue the hand-wringing and declarations that software companies are doomed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Open-source software projects that use agents to paper over long-standing resource constraints should logically be among the first to benefit from the era of cheap code. But that equation just doesn’t quite stick. In practice, the impact of AI coding tools on open source software has been far more mixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools have caused as many problems as they have solved, according to industry experts. The easy-to-use and accessible nature of AI coding tools has enabled a flood of bad code that threatens to overwhelm projects. Building new features is easier than ever, but maintaining them is just as hard and threatens to further fragment software ecosystems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is a more complicated story than simple software abundance. Perhaps, the predicted, imminent death of the software engineer in this new AI era is premature. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-quality-vs-quantity\">Quality vs quantity</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across the board, projects with open codebases are noticing a decline in the average quality of submissions, likely a result of AI tools lowering barriers to entry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For people who are junior to the VLC codebase, the quality of the merge requests we see is abysmal,” Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the CEO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.videolan.org/\">the VideoLan Organization</a> that oversees VLC, said in a recent interview.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kempf is still optimistic about AI coding tools overall but says they’re best “for experienced developers.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been similar problems for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/\">Blender</a>, a 3D modeling tool that has been maintained as open source since 2002. Blender Foundation CEO Franceso Siddi said LLM-assisted contributions typically “wasted reviewers’ time and affected their motivation.” Blender is still developing an official policy for AI coding tools, but Siddi said they are “neither mandated nor recommended for contributors or core developers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flood of merge requests has gotten so bad that open-source developers are building new tools to manage it. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, developer Mitchell Hashimoto launched a system that would limit GitHub contributions to “vouched” users, effectively closing the open-door policy for open-source software. As Hashimoto put it in the announcement, “AI eliminated the natural barrier to entry that let OSS projects trust by default.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same effect has emerged in bug bounty programs, which give outside researchers an open door to report security vulnerabilities. The open-source data transfer program cURL recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenewstack.io/curls-daniel-stenberg-ai-is-ddosing-open-source-and-fixing-its-bugs/\">halted its bug bounty program</a> after being overwhelmed by what creator Daniel Stenberg described as “AI slop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the old days, someone actually invested a lot of time [in] the security report,” Stenberg said at a recent conference. “There was a built-in friction, but now there’s no effort at all in doing this. The floodgates are open.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s particularly frustrating because many of open-source projects are also seeing the benefits of AI coding tools. Kempf says it’s made building new modules for VLC far easier, provided there’s an experienced developer at the helm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can give the model the whole codebase of VLC and say, ‘I’m porting this to a new operating system,’” Kempf said. “It is useful for senior people to write new code, but it’s difficult to manage for people who don’t know what they’re doing.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-competing-priorities\">Competing priorities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger problem for open-source projects is a difference in priorities. Companies like Meta value new code and products, while open-source software work focuses more on stability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The problem is different from large companies to open-source projects,” Kempf commented. “They get promoted for writing code, not maintaining it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools are also arriving at a moment when software, in general, is particularly fragmented. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Open source investor Konstantin Vinogradov says AI tools are running into a long-standing trend in open-source engineering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On the one hand, we have exponentially growing code base with exponentially growing number of interdependences, And on the other hand, we have number of active maintainers, which is maybe slowly growing, but definitely not keeping up,” Vinogradov said. “With AI, both parts of this equation accelerated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a new way of thinking about AI’s impact on software engineering — one with alarming implications for the industry at large. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you see engineering as the process of producing working software, AI coding makes it easier than ever. But if engineering is really the process of managing software complexity, AI coding tools could make it harder. At the very least, it will take a lot of active planning and work to keep the sprawling complexity in check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Vinogradov, the result is a familiar situation for open-source projects: a lot of work to do, and not enough good engineers to do it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI does not increase the number of active, skilled maintainers,” he remarked. “It empowers the good ones, but all the fundamental problems just remain.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

FreeForm declined to disclose the company’s post-financing valuation, which Pitchbook cites as $179 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO and cofounder Erik Palitsch said the funding would allow the company to upgrade its current GoldenEye printing system, which uses 18 lasers to fuse metal powders into precision components, to a new version. Dubbed Skyfall, the next iteration of the platform would use hundreds of lasers to produce thousands of kilograms of metal parts each day. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the culmination of a vision Palitsch and co-founder/president Thomas Ronacher launched in 2018. The two met while developing rocket engines at SpaceX, where they found that industrial machines for printing metal components are expensive, finicky, and not well designed for mass manufacturing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their new company would build its platform from the ground up to achieve higher throughput and flexibility, with an emphasis on active software controls. Palitsch says Freeform’s platform is “AI native,” noting a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/ex-spacex-engineers-land-14m-to-scale-new-method-for-3d-printing-metal/\">partnership with Nvidia</a> that allows the company to access advanced GPUs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we’re the only quote-unquote manufacturing company out there that has H200 clusters in a data center on site,” Paltisch told TechCrunch. “What are they doing? We’re running real-time physics-based simulations and learning all the different aspects of the end to end manufacturing workflow.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The data collected by sensors in the company’s manufacturing platform and during the simulations allows Freeform to rapidly improve production quality and quantity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have more meaningful data on the physics of the metal-printing process than any company in the world,” head of talent Cameron Kay said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Palitsch said he could not disclose any customers, he said the company is already delivering hundreds of “mission-critical” parts to buyers.

The first five to 10 employees will have a massive impact on the company culture, and the precedents set with them are difficult to change down the road. That’s why this season on Build Mode, we’re diving into what it takes to build a world-class founding team.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To kick off season two, Isabelle Johannessen is joined by Yuri Sagalov, managing director at General Catalyst and former founder, YC partner, and seed investor at Wayfinder Ventures. Sagalov has worked with hundreds of pre-seed and seed-stage companies and has seen firsthand the best (and worst) ways to hire in the early days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this episode, Sagalov offers his best pieces of advice for founders who are hiring their first team, strategically building their cap table, and forming compensation structures that can scale with the company.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-three-types-of-investors-and-which-one-to-avoid\">The three types of investors (and which one to avoid) </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagalov categorizes investors into three main buckets: the ones that are heavily involved and function as an extension of your team, the ones that will give you a check and then vanish, and the micromanagers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first type of investor is the most valuable according to Sagalov: “They’re going to help you with recruiting, hiring, go to market. And the most interesting thing with those investors is often it’s completely disconnected from the check size.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it may feel counterintuitive to turn down investments, working with VCs who will become overly involved in the process may cause more harm than good in the long run. Sagalov said, “The only bucket that I avoid is this third bucket of investors who give you money and they’re kind of in your kitchen, meddling. They have an opinion on everything. They get stressed out when things don’t go right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a fundraise, everyone is putting their best foot forward, so Sagalov suggests reaching out to current portfolio companies before committing to an investor.  “The best thing you can do as a founder is actually talk to portfolio companies, talk to other founders that they’ve worked with, ask for concrete examples of how they’ve been helpful, if they’ve been helpful, and then actually ask how they were when things didn’t go right.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-split-equity-with-a-co-founder\">How to split equity with a co-founder </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an investor, Sagalov looks for co-founders who have created an equity split that is fair but also hedges for future misalignments. He suggests creating a slight differentiation by plus or minus one share so there is a clear way to break deadlocks.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagalov also reminds early-stage founders that these early decisions have staying power: “Oftentimes founders over-index on ‘I came up with the idea, so I deserve the lion’s share.’  Most of the journey of the company is ahead of them. You don’t want someone waking up five years from now feeling like they put in equal blood, sweat, and tears but own one-fifth of the equity.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talk-to-early-employees-about-risk-and-compensation\">Talk to early employees about risk and compensation </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first few hires should be all in on the startup’s mission. Oftentimes, joining an early-stage startup can be perceived as risky. Sagalov emphasized the importance of discussing the risks and potential benefits: “Fundamentally, what you’re looking for when you’re hiring the first few people are missionaries who, beyond even the compensation, want to join you for the mission of the business,” he said. “You want to be honest with them that there is a lot of risk on the journey.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next week on Build Mode, we’re talking with Sarah Lucena, the founder and CEO of Mappa, who discusses how founders can take compatibility into account and hire the right fit for the team the first time, using their AI tool. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Isabelle Johannessen is our host. Build Mode is produced and edited by Maggie Nye. Audience Development is led by Morgan Little.

The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company’s enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/openai-for-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/openais-stargate-project-sets-its-sights-on-international-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stargate project</a>, which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services’ HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata’s workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI’s tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company’s expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users</a> spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI’s most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI’s access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI’s long-term ambitions in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata’s businesses. The conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. TCS also intends to use OpenAI’s Codex tools to standardize AI-native software development across its engineering teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said OpenAI’s partnership would help build “state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India” while supporting efforts to skill the country’s workforce for the AI era.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, including whether OpenAI is making a capital investment in HyperVault or leasing capacity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November 2025, TCS <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/indias-tcs-gets-tpg-to-fund-half-of-2b-ai-data-center-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">secured backing from private equity firm TPG</a> to develop AI-ready infrastructure in India under its HyperVault data center business.

Earlier this week, OpenAI partnered with leading Indian engineering, medical, and design institutions to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-pushes-into-higher-education-as-india-seeks-to-scale-ai-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bring AI tools into higher education</a>, betting that India’s large developer base and more than a billion internet users will play a central role in the next phase of AI adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pine Labs is already using AI internally to automate parts of its settlement and reconciliation process, cutting the time it takes to clear daily settlements from hours to minutes, according to Chief executive B Amrish Rau. The Noida-based company previously relied on manual checks by dozens of employees to process funds from multiple banks before markets opened each day, a workflow that is now largely handled by AI-driven systems, he said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Pine Labs, the partnership is intended to extend those AI-driven efficiencies beyond internal operations to merchants and corporate clients, starting with business-to-business use cases such as invoice processing, settlements and payments orchestration, Rau told TechCrunch. He noted the company sees faster adoption in B2B workflows, where AI agents can handle large volumes of repetitive financial tasks under predefined rules, before similar capabilities reach consumer-facing payments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People talk about retail AI, but the bigger impact of all of this is really efficiency improvement, especially in B2B,” Rau said. “If you look at invoicing and settlement, those are workflows where agents can actually drive the process end to end, and that’s where adoption can happen faster.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rollout of more autonomous, agent-led payment workflows will move faster in overseas markets where regulations already allow such transactions, Rau said, while India is likely to see a more gradual adoption focused on AI-assisted commerce rather than fully agent-initiated payments. He said that Pine Labs is already prototyping agent-driven payments in parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, even as Indian regulations require tighter controls on how payments are authorized.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For OpenAI, the partnership offers a route deeper into India’s payments and enterprise ecosystem as it looks to move beyond consumer-facing tools and embed its models into high-volume, regulated workflows. Rau said the collaboration is aimed at increasing merchant stickiness and expanding Pine Labs’ role from a payments processor to a broader commerce platform, with higher transaction volumes over time translating into incremental revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pine Labs says it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/pine-labs-aims-to-take-indian-fintech-global-even-as-it-cuts-valuation-for-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">works with more than 980,000 merchants</a>, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, and has processed over 6 billion cumulative transactions valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (about $126 billion), per its prospectus published last year. The fintech operates across 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, parts of Africa, the UAE, and the U.S., giving the OpenAI partnership reach across both Indian and international markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rau said the partnership does not involve revenue sharing between the two companies, with Pine Labs not taking a cut if its merchants choose to embed OpenAI’s tools. “We’ve kept it completely independent of each other — anything related to payment and payment services, we will get the benefit of it, and anything related to OpenAI revenues will go to them,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The arrangement, Rau added, is also non-exclusive. He compared it to OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe in the U.S. and said Pine Labs remains open to working with other AI providers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rau said Pine Labs is building additional security and compliance layers around AI-driven workflows to ensure that sensitive merchant and consumer transaction data remains protected, as the company integrates AI more deeply into its payments systems. He said the focus is on ensuring transactions remain secure and compliant even as more workflows are automated by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pine Labs’ interest in AI-driven commerce builds on earlier work through its Setu unit, which has <a href=\"https://www.pinelabs.com/media-analyst/setu-launches-indias-first-agentic-bill-payments-experience-on-chatgpt-and-claude\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">experimented with agent-led bill payment experiences</a> using chatbots including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Separately, India also began piloting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/india-pilots-ai-chatbot-led-e-commerce-with-chatgpt-gemini-claude-in-the-mix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consumer payments directly through AI chatbots</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new announcement comes as India hosts its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are showcasing their latest capabilities alongside Indian startups demonstrating AI applications aimed at large-scale deployment across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Germ’s standalone app is also available in a public beta on iOS in North America and Europe. That app had seen thousands of downloads so far, but after the official integration announcement, daily active users jumped by 5x, the team said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">California-based Germ is a startup founded by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tessa-r-brown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tessa Brown</a>, a communications scholar who previously taught at Stanford, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmxue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mark Xue</a>, who worked as a privacy engineer at Apple on technologies like FaceTime and iMessage. The idea, the company previously explained to TechCrunch, was to offer an alternative to other E2E encrypted platforms like iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp that’s built on newer technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Germ takes advantage of Messaging Layer Security (MLS), a new standard approved by the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF), and the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol</a> (or ATProto), which powers Bluesky, Skylight, and a growing number of other social apps. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of requiring a user’s phone number, Germ integrates with ATProto to enable its encrypted chats. That means Germ’s messages cannot be decrypted by another service, including itself or Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the new messenger, you’ll simply click on the badge on a friend’s profile on Bluesky, which opens an iOS App Clip — a lightweight, temporary app. You click “open” on this app experience and then authenticate by logging in with your ATProto handle. You can then send a message to a friend immediately. You’ll also be nudged to download the full Germ DM app, but this is optional. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you want to add the badge to your own profile, you’ll download the Germ DM app on iOS and authenticate your Bluesky credentials there. (Note: We had to force-quit the Bluesky iOS app and restart it before the Germ badge appeared.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?w=315\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094104\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png 408w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=199,430 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=334,720 334w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=371,800 371w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=310,668 310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=174,375 174w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=286,617 286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=246,531 246w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-screen_mockup.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Germ Network</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been building up to the official Bluesky integration for many months, starting with a private beta in August, which was launched using “magic links” shared in users’ bios. Now, users who set up Germ to work within Bluesky will receive a new badge that’s displayed on their profiles, allowing them to remove the link-in-bio option they were using before. (The links will still work, but the badge is easier and more noticeable, of course.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Germ told TechCrunch their startup has been in conversation with the ATProto developer community, including Bluesky’s app and protocol teams, since the <a href=\"https://atprotocol.dev/atmosphereconf-seattle-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ATmosphere Conference in Seattle</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve been transparent about our planning and roadmap, and shipping our private beta in August generated valuable feedback from users and developers about the desire to replace our links in bios with native UI,” said Xue, who serves as CTO at Germ Network. “Both our team and Bluesky’s saw value in better AppView support for the Germ link.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes to Bluesky’s app were led by head of product Alex Benzer, as the company was <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/protocol-checkin-fall-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">looked to experiment</a> with implementing third-party services within Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Working directly with the Bluesky team has been a treat,” Brown, Germ’s CEO, told TechCrunch. “They ship fast, prioritize the user experience, and care about their users’ access to end-to-end encrypted messaging. We’re thrilled to be the first secure messenger they’ve brought natively into their app.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s true that the AT Protocol could eventually implement E2E encryption, that is not a focus today. As Bluesky protocol engineer Daniel Holms recently explained, the company has several reasons not to design a system itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reality is that E2EE is hard,” he <a href=\"https://dholms.leaflet.pub/3meluqcwky22a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a blog post</a>. “And this inherent complexity isn’t something that the protocol team at Bluesky can just handle – it gets pushed out to every dev trying to build a client that works with encrypted data,” Holms said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xue agreed, adding, “We align with the ATProto ethos that people should be able to communicate using the apps and tools they choose. We believe that by solving the hard problems for ATProto users in safe, transparent, and user-friendly ways, they’ll continue to choose us,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after Bluesky added support for the Germ badge, another <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/blackskyweb.xyz/post/3meoxfu7ap22m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol-based client, Blacksky</a>, did as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown noted the team is currently focused on shipping more everyday messaging features, not on monetization. But further down the road, Germ may test paid features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect that our first paid features will be centered on the needs of prosumer power users like creators, journalists, and politicians—for example, support for multiple handles and private AI-powered screening for first messages from new connections,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Specifically, it covers SeatGeek’s 15 major U.S. venue partners, including State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Nissan Stadium in Nashville, and AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington. (So, although SeatGeek is a major player in the secondary ticketing space, this integration is exclusive to venues where it operates as the primary ticketing platform.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a strategic win for SeatGeek.

At the time, the company was testing the robots at a facility in South Carolina and said it took Amazon <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/new-robots-amazon-fulfillment-agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">significantly less time to develop Blue Jay</a> — only about a year— than it did to develop its other warehouse robots, a speed the company credited to advancements in AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon spokesperson Terrence Clark told TechCrunch that Blue Jay was launched as a prototype — although that was not made clear in the company’s original press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use Blue Jay’s core technology for other robotics “manipulation programs” with employees who worked on Blue Jay being moved to other projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark told TechCrunch over email. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also unveiled the Vulcan robot last year, which is used in the storage compartments of the company’s warehouses. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/amazon-debuts-a-warehouse-robot-with-a-sense-of-touch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vulcan is a two-armed robot</a>, with one arm meant to rearrange and move items in a compartment while the other is equipped with a camera and suction cups to grab goods. The Vulcan can allegedly “feel” the objects that it touches and was trained on data gathered from real-world interactions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon has been developing its internal robotics program since 2012 when it purchased Kiva Systems, a robotics company whose warehouse automation technology formed the foundation of Amazon’s fulfillment operations.

The post outlines the app’s future direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app, which is part of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the fediverse</a> — a larger, decentralized social web operating on the ActivityPub protocol — was thrust back into the spotlight when Elon Musk acquired Twitter, now called X, in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">October 2022</a>. Since then, it has seen occasional growth spurts but has often struggled to retain new users due to its more complicated setup. On Mastodon, you don’t simply create an account with a username and password; you also have to pick a server to join — an additional step that often confuses those new to decentralization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Mastodon sees somewhere between 750,000 and 1 million monthly active users, depending on the source. One <a href=\"https://mastodon.fediverse.observer/stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">third-party tracker</a> puts the figure closer to 750,000, while another estimates as many as <a href=\"https://fedidb.com/software/mastodon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1 million</a>. <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mastodon’s own site</a> says the figure is around 785,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of its coming updates, the organization says it will try to make this onboarding process more understandable, while also promoting smaller servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To date, new users have often defaulted to picking the largest servers, but that undermines the power of a decentralized web. As the blog post notes, “Mastodon is best when communities are spread across many independent servers, each with its own character and focus.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New admin tools will help indie server operators handle maintenance and moderation duties more easily, including a feature to use external blocklists. The organization will also offer ways to set up content scanning for detecting illegal content and spam, along with other tools to reduce media storage usage by serving remote media posts through a trusted third party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Mastodon will look to bring on more content creators, including public figures, journalists, and institutions, with a series of updates to its app. To do so, it’s introducing a redesigned user profile that lets individuals showcase their work as well as an enhanced compose experience. Also in the works is a new email notification option that would allow someone to follow their updates, even if they don’t yet have a Mastodon account. That could appeal to those who want to follow newsletter writers, reporters, thought leaders, and other creators, while allowing those creators to reach a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes follow the rollout of other new features in recent months, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/mastodon-rolls-out-quote-posts-with-protections-to-prevent-dunking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Quote Posts</a>, similar to the feature on X and others, but with more user controls, and plans for its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/mastodon-is-taking-cues-from-bluesky-with-plans-for-its-own-starter-packs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">own take on Starter Pack-style user recommendations</a>, called <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/featured_collections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Collections</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updates follow a shift in leadership at Mastodon: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\">founder </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eugen Rochko </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\">stepped down as CEO</a> after the platform announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/mastodon-announces-transition-to-nonprofit-structure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transition to a nonprofit structure</a> at the beginning of the year.

However, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/fei-fei-li-s-ai-startup-world-labs-in-funding-talks-at-5-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> a month ago suggested it was aiming to raise at a $5 billion valuation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership between World Labs and Autodesk will see the two companies collaborating to explore how World Labs’ models — AI systems that can generate and reason about immersive 3D environments — can work alongside Autodesk’s tools, and vice versa, starting with a focus on entertainment use cases. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For World Labs, Autodesk’s investment is a signal that its product has commercial appeal. The startup’s first world model product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Marble</a>, released last November, lets users create editable, downloadable 3D environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk is one of the biggest developers of 3D CAD (computer-aided design) software. Its platform underpins architectural, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and entertainment workflows. That focus on the built world makes investment in advanced spatial AI a natural extension of its core business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or as Li put it in a statement: “Autodesk has long helped people think spatially and solve real-world problems and, together, we share a clear purpose: building physical AI that augments human creativity and puts more powerful tools in the hands of designers, builders, and creators.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, Autodesk will serve as an adviser to World Labs, and the two will collaborate at the “research and model level.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daron Green, Autodesk’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch the partnership is still in its early days, so the precise form it’s going to take hasn’t been determined yet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You could anticipate us consuming their models or them consuming our models in different settings,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He mused that customers might like to start with a world-model-based sketch in World Labs (say, of an office layout) and then drill down on certain design aspects (like the design of the desk), which is where Autodesk’s tech might come in. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Similarly, you might want to take an object that you’ve designed in our [platform], and put it in a context that you create through one of [World Labs’] prompts,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green added that data sharing is not part of the agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green said the two companies plan to start with media and entertainment use cases. Most companies building world models — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/i-built-marshmallow-castles-in-googles-new-ai-world-generator-project-genie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google DeepMind</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/\">Runway</a> — see gaming and interactive entertainment as an initial go-to-market strategy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk already works with most major media production companies and has been training models for character animation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are close to world models,” Green said. “They’re a characterization of an animal in the world that’s responding to physical constraints like time, maybe a terrain it needs to traverse. So there’s a physical understanding in the model, and you can see how that might be combined [with World Labs’ tech]. You’re not just animating the dog, but you’re giving it a world within which it can now interact.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership with World Labs supports Autodesk’s broader push to integrate more AI features across its software portfolio. The company is developing <a href=\"https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/news/upcoming-3d-generative-ai-foundation-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“neural CAD,”</a> a new kind of generative AI model trained on geometric data that can reason about components and entire systems. Put simply, it can generate working 3D models, not just images, with an understanding of how those designs would function in the real world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk’s neural CAD models are already being integrated into the firm’s product design and architecture products as a step toward more advanced spatial intelligence. But World Labs’ models could help extend that capability beyond individual design files toward more holistic digital representations of the physical world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green thinks different AI systems, including large language models, world models, and neural CAD will be combined in the future to improve designs for Autodesk’s customers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If AI is to be truly useful, it must understand worlds, not just words,” Li said in the statement. “Worlds are governed by geometry, physics, and dynamics, and reconciling the semantic, spatial, and physical is the next great frontier of AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to include more details on World Labs’ raise.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The “Auto Best Take” feature captures multiple frames in one shutter press and automatically selects the best version so everyone looks good in a group photo, while the “Camera Coach” feature gives users step-by-step guidance on lighting and composition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Google is bringing <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15254448?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Satellite SOS</a> to the A-series for the first time, allowing users to connect with emergency services even when they don’t have Wi-Fi or cellular service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with recent Pixel phones, the Pixel 10a will come with seven years of software and security updates.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that the Pixel 10a doesn’t have the “PixelSnap” magnetic Qi charging feature on the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The smartphone’s arrival comes just ahead of Apple’s upcoming new entry-level phone, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the iPhone 17e</a>.
