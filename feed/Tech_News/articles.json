The company made headlines in 2023 when <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/russian-zero-day-seller-offers-20m-for-hacking-android-and-iphones/\">it announced that it was offering</a> up to $20 million for zero-days in Android devices and iPhones, and later announced that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/russian-zero-day-seller-is-offering-up-to-4-million-for-telegram-exploits/\">it was offering up to $4 million</a> for zero-days in Telegram. The company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/\">claims</a> to work exclusively with the Russian government and local organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said that Operation Zero’s customers “could use the tools to launch ransomware attacks or engage in other malign activities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Treasury said it’s also sanctioning the company’s founder, Sergey Zelenyuk, who officials accused of selling exploits to foreign intelligence agencies, and who say he sought to develop spyware and hacking technologies. The Treasury said Zelenyuk engaged in recruiting hackers and developing relationships with foreign intelligence agencies through social media. (Operation Zero has accounts on both X and Telegram.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the Treasury, Operation Zero acquired “at least eight proprietary cyber tools, which were created for the exclusive use of the U.S. government and select allies and which were stolen from a U.S. company,” and then “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Treasury said that the sanctions against Operation Zero and Zelenyuk coincide with an FBI investigation into Peter Williams, who worked for U.S. defense contractor L3Harris. In October, Williams <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/former-l3harris-trenchant-boss-pleads-guilty-to-selling-zero-day-exploits-to-russian-broker/\">pleaded guilty to selling at least eight of the company’s exploits</a> to an unspecified Russian broker. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Treasury now says that the broker was Operation Zero, something that the government had not previously confirmed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>\nDo you have more information about Operation Zero?

The broker also offered high-paying bounties for hacking tools in popular software and hardware like Android devices, iPhones, Windows, and Chrome. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero and Zelenyuk did not respond to a request for comment. Kucherov, Mamashoyev, and Vasanovich could not be immediately reached for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When contacted by TechCrunch, a person operating an Advanced Security Solution’s chat account claimed without evidence that Mamashoyev is not the founder of the company.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, it can use Google Sheets to maintain memory across sessions, such as a shopping list for an e-commerce-related app. The new agent creates and plans the next step for the tasks on its own.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/interior_design_opal.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096225\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said these agents are natively interactive, which means that if they need more information, they would ask users to enter it or offer them choices to determine next steps, if needed. With this addition, users without technical knowledge could build complex workflows within their apps, the company claims.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vibe-cooling tool <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/google-is-testing-a-vibe-coding-app-called-opal/\">Opal was first introduced </a>for U.S. users in July 2025. The tool lets anyone create mini web apps or remix existing apps. In October 2025, the company rolled out Opal to users in 15 more countries, including Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and Singapore. And in December, Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/googles-vibe-coding-tool-opal-comes-to-gemini/\">added the tool to the Gemini web app</a>, allowing users to create custom apps through a visual editor without writing any code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond Google, many other startups are also building tools that let users build apps via natural language prompts. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/lovable-on-track-to-raise-150m-at-2b-valuation/\">Lovable</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/replit-hits-3b-valuation-on-150m-annualized-revenue/\">Replit</a> are among the more popular ones, but other startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/\">former Replika founder’s Wabi</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/indian-vibe-coding-startup-emergent-raises-70m-at-300m-valuation-from-softbank-khosla-ventures/\">Softbank and Lightspeed-backed Emergent</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/\">Accel-backed Rocket.new</a> are also gaining prominence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Yes, you read that right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Eternal Playlist Urn is not really meant to hold ashes, but is instead a collector’s item, with only 150 available for purchase in the U.S. For $495, buyers receive a 7-inch-by-11.4-inch urn with a Bluetooth speaker built into the lid. (We question the audio quality, since all the tech is crammed into the lid of this tiny urn.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Spotify, the urn offers “the world’s first ever music-streaming urn,” making death “a lot less boring.” With this product, the idea is that even the dearly departed can keep jamming to their favorite tunes for eternity, or at least that’s the company’s joke.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Life needs music. So does the afterlife. That’s why Spotify has partnered with Liquid Death to create the Eternal Playlist Urn, the world’s first wireless speaker designed to bring your music somewhere it’s never been before,” Spotify <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-02-24/liquid-death-eternal-playlist-urn/\">stated</a> in a blog post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you get the urn, you can create your own <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://open.spotify.com/presents/eternalplaylist\">Eternal Playlist</a> on Spotify by answering questions like “What’s your eternal vibe?” or “What’s your go-to ghost noise?” Spotify will then use your answers and listening history to generate a custom playlist, which syncs directly to the urn’s speaker and can be shared with friends and family.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096236\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Liquid_Death-spotify.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Spotify hasn’t released a branded smart speaker, it partnered with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/newsroom/corporate-news/ikea-introduces-first-bluetooth-speaker-with-spotify-tap-to-bring-light-and-music-outdoors-pub9ead9890/\">Ikea</a> in 2022 on a portable Bluetooth lamp speaker with Spotify Tap functionality, making this the company’s second hardware collaboration with another brand.

Until now, a temporary suspension on Twitch meant losing access to the platform altogether, including the ability to chat, watch streams while logged in, and access basic information. Now, the company is implementing two suspension types: streaming suspensions and chatting suspensions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that while its previous approach was easier to implement, its new targeted enforcement system means that the restrictions will match the specific offense committed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If a user violates Twitch’s Community Guidelines during a livestream, their account will be suspended from going live, and chat on their channel will be temporarily disabled. During a streaming suspension, the user can still watch streams while logged in, chat on other channels, and access their user dashboard. Plus, viewers will still be able to watch their existing clips and videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, if someone violates the company’s Community Guidelines in chat, they will receive a suspension from chat but will still be able to stream their own content or watch other streamers. Notably, users who receive a chat suspension can still chat in their own channel, but they will be prevented from participating in chats on other streams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Higher severity violations present a greater risk to our community, therefore they will receive both chatting and streaming suspensions simultaneously to prevent further harm,” Twitch explained in a blog post. “And, as is the case today, those who commit the most serious violations will receive an indefinite suspension and lose all access to Twitch. There is no place for serious violations on Twitch.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Twitch isn’t changing the length of temporary suspensions, as streaming and chatting suspensions will last anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says that with each new violation, the length of the suspension will increase, and that accumulating multiple temporary suspensions can still lead to an indefinite suspension from Twitch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Twitch determines the severity of a violation by considering the extent of harm it causes or has the potential to cause. It defines harm as any action that leads to physical, emotional, social, or financial damage to a user or to Twitch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is working on additional suspension types that will roll out in future updates.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In fact, Lightcap said OpenAI was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-coo-worlds-most-active-slack-user-2025-10\">a massive Slack user last year</a>, indicating how much AI firms are still reliant on traditional enterprise software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/a-business-that-scales-with-the-value-of-intelligence/\">OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar posted that the company’s revenue is on the rise</a>, with the startup ending 2025 with over $20 billion in annualized revenue. Lightcap said that demand is strong, without sharing any numbers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We almost always find ourselves having to manage too much demand. We are still an organization that is growing, and so there is this global demand factor that we would love to be able to meet, and we are working as best as we can to be able to meet,” Lightcap said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, OpenAI is thinking about how to quantify success in the enterprise. Lightcap said that OpenAI will try to measure Frontier’s impact based on “business outcomes, not on seat licenses.” (The comapny hasn’t yet shared pricing for Frontier.) </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Frontier is a way for us to experiment iteratively with how to actually bring AI into the really messy and complex areas of businesses that I think if we get that right, we’re going to learn a lot about both businesses and also AI systems,” Lightcap noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Days after TechCrunch’s conversation, OpenAI partnered with consultancies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/openai-calls-in-the-consultants-for-its-enterprise-push/\">Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey, Accenture, and Capgemini </a>to deploy its technology in an enterprise push. Even rival Anthropic launched plugins for finance, engineering, and design for enterprises to build agents based on Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the company doesn’t have a clear path of integrating recently acquired open-source tool OpenClaw, but Lightcap said that it gives OpenAI “a glimpse into the future” where agents can do “almost anything you want them to be able to do on a computer.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In keeping with the India AI summit, OpenAI has made a number of recent announcements around its business in the world’s largest market. The company said India was the second biggest user base of ChatGPT outside the U.S., with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\">more than 100 million weekly users</a>. Lightcap said that voice as a modality is picking up in India and enabling OpenAI to reach more people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Voice is so important here. And voice models now feel good enough and also good enough to run in low-latency and low-bandwidth environments, where you really can start to enable access to technology for a group of people who maybe were more disenfranchised than not,” Lightcap said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also signed an enterprise contract for the usage of its tools and to deploy compute. Lightcap noted India is fourth in India in terms of enterprise seats in Asia, which is low for a populous country, and OpenAI has a lot of scope to expand here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI company is also set to open two new offices in India in Mumbai and Bengaluru. However, these are likely to be sales and go-to-market offices. When I asked Lightcap if these offices would include technical talent, he said, “Never say never.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is also a fear of job impact, especially in countries like India, where the IT services and BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) industry is prominent, as AI tools automate some of the tasks. In the past few weeks, Indian IT company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/nifty-it-index-crashes-nearly-3-as-anthropic-s-ai-claims-fuel-disruption-fears-tcs-infosys-among-top-losers-13840666.html\">stocks have dipped</a> as the market is taking into account the fact that areas like coding might require fewer humans. Lightcap said that the company is being “grounded” in what it has observed in terms of jobs market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our view is that over time, jobs will change. I think we don’t yet know where, how, or what, but it seems inevitable that work will look different in the future than it looks today. And that’s natural, that’s part of the business cycle. It’s part of the global and dynamic economy that we live in. And so I think what we have to do is be able to obviously have empathy for where jobs are changing at a high rate,” he noted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Investors buying the shares include Thrive Capital, Coatue, Andreessen Horowitz, and Stripe itself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/stripe-finalizes-tender-sale-at-a-91-5b-valuation-says-payment-volumes-grew-to-1-4t-in-2024/\">Stripe announced its previous tender offer</a>, which valued the company at $91.5 billion. So that’s about a 74% increase in valuation over the year. The annual announcement isn’t by chance. Stripe has timed this news with its annual letter from founders Patrick and John Collison that showcases its year of product releases, and some insights into global usage of its products for a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Stripe says that stablecoin payments volume doubled worldwide to around <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stablecoins-payments-what-raw-transaction-numbers-4qjke\">$400 billion</a> in 2025, 60% of which it estimates comes from B2B payments. That growth is one reason why Stripe has invested heavily in crypto foundations recently, acquiring crypto wallet service Privy in July, and unveiling its own blockchain for payments, Tempo, in September. As for Bridge, the stablecoin orchestration platform that Stripe acquired last year, it saw its volume more than quadruple, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: This story originally stated that the global stablecoin volume was on Stripe’s network and has now been corrected.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

These options were previously only available to customers on its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://youtube.com/premium\">full plan</a>, which costs $13.99 per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said the additions were the result of user feedback, as customers in its pilot program shared that they wanted these specific features to make the subscription more attractive. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/youtube-launches-a-7-99-per-month-ad-free-premium-lite-subscription/\">Launched last March</a>, YouTube Premium Lite introduced a more modestly priced subscription tier that would remove ads from “most” videos on the platform, including those across popular verticals like gaming, fashion, beauty, cooking, news, and more. However, ads would continue to be shown on music content and music videos. Plus, customers on the Lite plan won’t have access to the ad-free YouTube Music app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the arrival of these new features, ad-free music content will now be the only reason to upgrade to the full Premium subscription. It will also likely make the Lite tier more attractive to customers who didn’t want to pay just for ad-free content but wanted other upgrades, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Lite subscription tier was first introduced in Thailand, Germany, and Australia, before <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-premium-lite/\">coming to the U.S.</a> last year.

Meanwhile, the “subscriptions, platforms and devices” group’s revenue increased 17% to $13.6 billion in Q4, which the company attributed to strong growth in YouTube subscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and YouTube Premium.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alphabet reported more than 125 million YouTube Music and YouTube Premium users worldwide in March 2025.

Hundreds of musicians, including stars like Billie Eilish, Katy Perry, and Jon Bon Jovi, signed an open letter in 2024 calling on tech companies not to undermine human creativity with AI music generation tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A cohort of music publishers also recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3b-over-flagrant-piracy-of-20000-works/\">sued</a> the AI company Anthropic for $3 billion, claiming that the company illegally downloaded more than 20,000 copyrighted songs, including sheet music, song lyrics, and musical compositions. (Anthropic was already ordered by the court to offer a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\">$1.5 billion</a> settlement to authors whose books were pirated for AI training.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other artists, however, have embraced the potential of this technology as a way to improve audio quality, rather than as a creative aid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paul McCartney used <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/the-beatles-won-a-grammy-last-night-thanks-to-ai/\">AI-powered noise reduction systems</a> — the kind of technology that allows Zoom or FaceTime to block out unwanted background noises on your video calls — to clean up a decades-old, low-quality John Lennon demo.

Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&amp;B song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opuDZYJuAz0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">How Was I Supposed To Know</a>” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$3 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The law remains unclear on the legality of using copyrighted works as training data — one federal judge, William Alsup, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\">ruled last year</a> that training on copyrighted data is legal, but pirating it is not. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It claims the 2025 breach at SonicWall “exposed critical security information for Marquis and every customer that used SonicWall’s firewall cloud backup service.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis’ chief executive Satin Mirchandani told TechCrunch in a statement that SonicWall allegedly failed to secure its backup service, which caused the company to suffer “significant reputational, operational, and financial harm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News of the lawsuit comes weeks after TechCrunch reported that Marquis was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/fintech-firm-marquis-blames-hack-at-firewall-provider-sonicwall-for-its-data-breach/\">planning to seek compensation</a> from SonicWall. The Plano, Texas-based fintech giant had told its customers that it blamed SonicWall for allowing hackers to steal sensitive information about customer firewall configuration files, including its own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“SonicWall allowed a threat actor to obtain the keys to bypass that line of defense and walk right into Marquis’s internal network, the very thing that SonicWall’s firewall was supposed to prevent,” reads the complaint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Firewalls are meant to prevent unauthorized access to a company’s network, but Marquis alleges that the hackers who scrambled its network with ransomware used information stolen from SonicWall about how its customers configure their firewalls, including emergency passcodes (known as scratch codes) that allowed access to Marquis’ internal network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis, which allows hundreds of banks and credit unions to visualize their customers’ data, said the hackers took “personally identifiable information concerning customers of some of Marquis’s financial institution clients” in its cyberattack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, including bank account, debit, and credit card numbers, as well as customers’ Social Security numbers</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for SonicWall did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SonicWall <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sonicwall.com/support/notices/mysonicwall-cloud-backup-file-incident/kA1VN0000000RoD0AU\">first admitted</a> a breach of its systems in mid-September, in which it said fewer than 5% of its customer firewall configuration backup files were exfiltrated from its storage servers, hosted on Amazon’s cloud and maintained by SonicWall. The firewall maker in October <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/sonicwall_breach_hits_every_cloud/\">conceded that in fact every customer</a> had their firewall backup files stolen in the breach. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis in December 2025 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/fintech-firm-marquis-alerts-dozens-of-us-banks-and-credit-unions-of-a-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">began notifying affected people</a> that its networks had been breached that August. SonicWall has not said when hackers were first able to gain access to its systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not yet clear what caused the breach at SonicWall. In its complaint, Marquis claims SonicWall made a code change to one of its APIs months earlier, in February 2025, that “created a vulnerability exploitable by threat actors.” Marquis said that this bug allowed the hackers to access customer firewall configuration backup files “without proper authentication” by guessing predictable firewall serial numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we were able to secure our network and client data quickly, our investigation revealed that our exposure to threat actors was due to SonicWall’s network breach and failure to notify us that our firewall protection was potentially compromised,” Mirchandani, the Marquis CEO, said in a statement shared with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirchandani told TechCrunch that SonicWall has not yet provided any non-public information about the root cause of its breach. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We hope to learn more through the litigation process,” Mirchandani said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis still will not say how many individuals are affected by its data breach. According to a listing with the Texas’ attorney general, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/fintech-firm-marquis-alerts-dozens-of-us-banks-and-credit-unions-of-a-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/\">at least 400,000 people across the U.S.</a> are known to be affected by the fintech giant’s breach. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The number of affected individuals is anticipated to rise as more data breach notifications are filed with various U.S. attorneys general.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Preply, for instance, will use the proceeds of its latest round to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dmytrovoloshyn_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%96-%D1%96%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%BC%D1%96%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B9%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%B2%D1%88%D1%96-%D1%96%D0%BD%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D1%83-activity-7422569547120947201-fg6I/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hire some 100 engineers</a> across its global teams — including in Ukraine, where one-third of its engineering staff is based.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Preply is one example among many. Defense tech <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/three-years-on-europe-looks-to-ukraine-for-the-future-of-defense-tech/\">has grabbed the most attention</a>, especially for the speed at which innovations reach the battlefield. But the same engineering talent and ingenuity are emerging as common denominators across sectors that also contribute to strengthening Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Ukraine facing a far larger attacker, the country <a href=\"https://mod.gov.ua/en/news/step-by-step-procedure-for-service-members-wishing-to-return-to-duty-after-an-absence-without-leave-awol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">takes a dim view</a> of efforts to escape mobilization. However, startups can be granted special status that shields key employees from the draft if they are deemed to support the country — and <a href=\"https://luminify.aspichi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Aspichi</a> is one of them, its founder, Victor Samoilenko, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Originally created in the U.S. in 2021, the company completely pivoted when the war started. It is now best known for Luminify, <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2026/02/11/ukraines-wartime-vr-therapy-is-scaling-beyond-trauma-care/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a mixed-reality platform for mental health care</a> that has been helping Ukrainians cope with wartime trauma. The startup collaborates directly with military units as well as with a dozen clinics that provide mental health support to the population.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are soldiers and veterans, bereaved families, and millions who have moved to western Ukraine or abroad. And for those who have always lived in Kyiv, the psychological toll is no less horrendous. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everybody is suffering,” Samoilenko said. “My daughter celebrated several New Year’s and Christmas underground; so the effect is enormous.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a winter marked by near-daily attacks on the power grid, Ukraine’s capital hasn’t been spared. According to Natali Trubnikova, CMO at Kyiv-based IT consultancy firm <a href=\"https://gartsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gart Solutions</a>, locals have adapted to power cuts with high-capacity power banks, gasoline stoves, and diesel generators. But rising costs mean they still have to use these sparingly, often keeping indoor temperatures to a strict minimum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These harsh conditions have turned offices into refuges from the cold. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our office has different generators so we have electricity, internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch last month.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For smaller startups, coworking spaces have also become havens. <a href=\"https://www.lift99kyiv.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LIFT99 Kyiv Hub</a>, a six-year-old venue that <a href=\"https://estonianworld.com/security/estonian-founded-startup-hub-lift99-in-kyiv-hit-by-russian-missile-strike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suffered damage</a> from a Russian strike last August, has seen its membership numbers surge since its reopening two months ago, its sales and partnership manager Lada Samarska <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lsamarska_kyiv-right-now-up-to-4-hours-of-electricity-ugcPost-7422674329580023808-nRf1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> on LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite missile strikes, Kyiv is far enough from the frontline to remain Ukraine’s main startup hub, but it is not the only one. Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, has drawn many displaced Ukrainians — tech workers among them. <a href=\"https://lemstation.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LEM Station</a>, a <a href=\"https://creativesunite.eu/article/how-lem-station-is-transforming-a-historic-tram-depot-in-lviv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">renovated tram depot</a> turned creative space, is a symbol of its growing ecosystem, which has also benefited from its proximity to the Polish border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foreign visitors have been fewer, but with Lviv still reachable by train, tech conference IT Arena 2025 <a href=\"https://itarena.ua/it-arena-2025-ai-technology-and-humans-in-the-fight-for-tomorrow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">brought 6,450 participants</a> from more than 40 countries to the city. Defense tech had its own stage, but the event also showcased support for a wider range of startups. Despite the war, VC firms remain active in the country, including <a href=\"https://www.1991.vc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1991</a>, <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/07/10/flyer-one-ventures-launches-eur50m-fund-v-to-back-cee-and-ukrainian-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Flyer One Ventures</a>, and <a href=\"https://smrk.vc/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SMRK</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the long journey, Ukrainians are still making the trip to tech conferences abroad too. At TechArena in Stockholm earlier this month, members of a <a href=\"https://itukraine.org.ua/en/calendar_events/techstep-sweden-ukrainian-delegation-at-techarena-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ukrainian delegation</a> told TechCrunch they were tired and waiting for the spring. But before saying goodbye, they started listing <a href=\"https://www.uawalloffame.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ukraine’s unicorns</a> — because that’s what you do, even in the middle of a war.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The full stock award is conditional on AMD’s share price, which would need to hit $600 for Meta to receive its final tranche, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-and-amd-agree-to-ai-chips-deal-worth-more-than-100-billion-9c7fd06b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcY1w7p4jt-HxCrx0DI-zmkO9gpjvyM3_PmfM0dnu1-Ku4Q1YPHtmLW-NXzKY0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699dbdee&amp;gaa_sig=exel6GajVHvnTh0czYE8aB9ib1uMxyyq5a5XlxrkBILGUpUjQ8my4K5eP1Q5hmfV7MAX-pmdS63L5dg3kdsPRw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per The Wall Street Journal</a>. AMD’s stock closed at $196.60 on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the agreement, Meta will purchase AMD’s MI540 series of GPUs and its latest generation of CPUs. CPUs are increasingly becoming a core pillar of the AI inference compute stack because they’re efficient, easier to scale, and don’t tie companies solely to Nvidia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The CPU market is absolutely on fire,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said Tuesday morning during an investor briefing. “There is significant demand. It has continued to grow, and it really is a result of the AI infrastructure deployments as inferencing scales, as agentic AI scales, and our portfolio is in an extremely good position.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AMD has been slowly gaining ground as AI firms look to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, which has been the longstanding leader in AI chips and has charged a premium for the title. Last October, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/\">AMD and OpenAI struck a similar</a> deal trading equity for an agreement to buy chips. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the firm’s partnership with AMD is “an important step” as it diversifies its compute and works toward “personal superintelligence.” Zuckerberg has defined personal superintelligence as AI systems designed to deeply understand and empower individuals in their everyday lives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has pledged to invest at least <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-plans-600-billion-us-spend-ai-data-centers-expand-2025-11-07/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$600 billion in U.S. data centers</a> and AI infrastructure over the next several years, including a projected capital expenditure spend of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\">$135 billion in 2026.</a> Meta recently unveiled plans for a $10 billion <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/gas-power-plants-approved-for-metas-10b-data-center-and-not-everyone-is-happy/\">gas-powered data center campus</a> in Indiana designed for 1 gigawatt of compute capacity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AMD partnership comes a couple of weeks after Meta struck a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/880513/nvidia-meta-ai-grace-vera-chips?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">multiyear deal </a>to expand its data centers with millions of Nvidia’s latest CPUs and GPUs.

By designing a model specifically for women and grounding it in trusted clinical science and real-world biometric data, we’re setting the standard for how responsible intelligence should be built and expanded across more areas of health, pairing rigorous science with the lived, longitudinal data that makes Oura uniquely powerful.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch of the new women’s health AI model comes as Oura Chief Commercial Officer Dorothy Kilroy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/oura-is-winning-young-women-and-losing-gym-rats-and-its-fine-with-that/\">told TechCrunch</a> last October that the company’s fastest-growing user segment isn’t gym rats, it’s women in their early twenties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When a user asks Oura Advisor a women’s health question, the chatbot prompts the new model to reference its research and knowledge sources while also analyzing the user’s relevant biometric signals across sleep, activity, cycle and pregnancy data, stress, and more. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new model is intentionally designed to be non-dismissive, reassuring, and emotionally supportive, the company notes.

It was a failure of approach.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the new program, companies can use the plug-in system to deploy pre-built agents to help with common enterprise tasks, including financial research and engineering specifications. The result is a major opportunity to grow Anthropic’s enterprise client base — and a significant threat to SaaS products currently performing those functions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe that the future of work means everybody having their own custom agent,” Anthropic product officer Matt Piccolella told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the enterprise agents program draws on previously announced technology, particularly Claude Cowork and the plugin system, which was announced in research preview <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/anthropic-brings-agentic-plugins-to-cowork/\">on January 30th</a>. The systems launched today are largely focused on making those tools easier to deploy within a company, including private software marketplaces, controlled data flows, and customized plugins. The result is a system for deploying Claude-powered agents with the same controls a corporate IT department would expect when deploying software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Admins want to be able to have really, really, really tailored workflows and skills for their specific organization,” Piccolella said. “And this allows the admin of a Claude Cowork organization to be able to do this in a very centralized way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stock plugins included at launch take aim at particular departments present within most companies, including agents designed for finance, legal, and HR departments. Each plugin includes basic skills common across different companies, although Anthropic expects that companies will modify each plugin to bring it in line with unique needs and customs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of finance, the stock plugin gives Claude the basic information and data flows necessary to perform market and competitive research, financial modeling, and other common tasks for finance teams. The HR plugin includes skills for generating job descriptions, onboarding materials, and offer letters, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch also includes a number of new enterprise connectors, including integrations for Gmail, DocuSign, and Clay, among others. Previously unavailable, these connectors will allow agents to pull in data and context directly from the linked system. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

There are multiple types of royalties, and artists need to make sure that their data is updated across all platforms so they don’t miss out on potential earnings. For them, ensuring that they have all the information in the right place while maintaining creative output is a tiresome task.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mogul, a platform founded by former SoundCloud head of creators Jeff Ponchick and former SoundCloud VP of engineering Joey Mason, announced Tuesday that it has helped artists track $1.5 billion in lost royalties since its launch last year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also raised $5 million in a new round of funding led by the Yamaha Music Innovations Fund with participation from the Urban Innovation Fund, Mindset Ventures, and Fairway Capital Partners, alongside existing investors Amplify LA and Wonder Ventures. The company has raised more than $6.3 million in funding to date. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mogul currently has six people on staff and plans to grow the team with the funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Kahn, managing partner at Yamaha Music Innovations Fund, believes that Mogul’s founding team has the credentials and experience to ship products that can help artists manage their careers better. He noted that Mogul’s product advantage lies in its data layer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe that Mogul has built the most comprehensive, first-party data pipeline that exists for residual income earners,” Kahn told TechCrunch over email. “Most companies that we have looked into in this space purport to have robust coverage when in actuality, they have limited connectivity to payers. This means that Mogul can be trusted for both accuracy and speed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since Mogul opened last year, its product has evolved. While it earlier gave users only a list of recommendations for better cataloguing, the company now offers more actionable insights, including better formats for lists, and cross-platform corrections to catalog data in some instances.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For example, Sound Exchange is an entity that collects royalties for digital performance for when your music gets played on SiriusXM,” Ponchick said. “If your Sound Exchange is linked, we’ll say, hey, we see you distributed these songs through DistroKid to Spotify; half of them are not in your Sound Exchange account.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He noted that if there is missing information, the tool can ask the user and then complete the registration for them. The company has added a bulk registration tool as well to add data to a source in mass quantities. Ponchick noted that on average, users have seen a 20% bump in their royalty revenues by using Mogul.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096086\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png 1724w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=768,584 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=680,517 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=1200,912 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=1280,973 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=430,327 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=720,547 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=900,684 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=800,608 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=1536,1167 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=668,508 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=494,375 494w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=812,617 812w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=699,531 699w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mogul_Catalog_Dashboard.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Mogul</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also rolled out a catalog valuation tool that can give an estimation of an artist’s catalog value across recording and publishing. The tool breaks down valuations by individual tracks and revenue sources such as Spotify and Apple Music. Ponchick said that the core thesis is to help artists manage and monetize their catalog better.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company earlier had a free tier, but it was not sustainable for the startup to offer automation tools at that tier, according to Ponchick, adding that a lot of musicians who were starting out or didn’t earn much royalties were using that tier, and long-term, Mogul wasn’t useful for them. To focus on providing more value to artists, the company got rid of its free tiers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The platform is also considering how to tackle the complexity of AI-generated music for tracking royalties. Ponchick noted that performing rights organizations allow registration of music partially created with AI, but fully AI-generated music might face scrutiny on certain platforms. Yamaha Music Innovations Fund’s Kahn said tracking AI music will bring challenges like volume complexity, ownership ambiguity, and attribution disputes in royalty tracking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The current infrastructure was built for a human creator ecosystem. High volume, probabilistic authorship could make tracking, allocating, and defending claims to IP and royalties more difficult,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mogul is currently playing a waiting game to see how the regulatory landscape plays out. Ponchick said that despite this, the company is well-positioned to track royalties for any kind of tracks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mogul is competing with other platforms in the area, including Notes.fm and Claimity. Things are changing at the structural level, too. The U.S. performing rights organization <a href=\"https://completemusicupdate.com/us-pro-alltrack-launches-mechanical-royalties-collection-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AllTrack launched a new division in 2024</a>, allowing creators to collect performance and mechanical royalties from one place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Real-world data drawn from the vehicles’ onboard computers shows that’s often not the case.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using that data, the Fraunhofer Institute could determine how much of that energy came from charging when plugged in. It <a href=\"https://www.oeko.de/fileadmin/oekodoc/Analyse_PHEV_2025_EN_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">found that</a> less than a third of 1 million PHEVs in Germany plugged in either occasionally or not at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. automakers that are pushing future PHEV models as appealing alternatives for American drivers should take note. By blending gas with electricity, these automakers hope to boost fleet-wide efficiency without a wide rollout of EVs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re looking to make CO<sub>2</sub> reductions across our lineup, but we’re doing it in a very efficient way,” Ford CEO Jim Farley <a href=\"https://s205.q4cdn.com/882619693/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Ford-Q4-2025-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said this month</a> in an earnings call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet the new study shows that PHEVs seldom deliver on their efficiency promises.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At best, Toyota drivers used electricity for 44% of the energy used for driving, suggesting they plugged in the most frequently. The worst? Porsche drivers, at just 0.8%, an average of 7 kilowatt-hours over two years. In other words, the average Porsche PHEV driver charged their battery less than 50% of its capacity — once.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Studies have previously shown that PHEVs produce about <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/771963/phev-emissions-five-times-higher-official/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">3.5 times more emissions</a> than their official ratings would suggest. This new study explains why since it directly assesses how much electricity the vehicles gained from charging. (PHEVs, like all hybrids, can operate in a mixed mode, using both gas and electricity. The study used data straight off the vehicles to disentangle the two.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of PHEV’s many shortcomings are their anemic batteries, capable of powering the vehicle for short distances. Some can only traverse a handful of miles, while many sold in recent years can operate on battery power for about 20 to 30 miles. Regulators in Europe and automakers have been proposing longer ranges for future models, hoping that a more capable battery will encourage people to charge their batteries more frequently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not guaranteed, though. The vehicles are likely to remain compromised when driving on electrons. That’s because most PHEVs are based on fossil fuel platforms — the electric motors and power electronics aren’t capable of delivering 100% of the vehicle’s power needs. When a driver floors it, the gas engine has to kick in. In other vehicles, the engine turns on in cold weather to heat the cabin. When that happens, “why bother plugging in” is apparently a question most PHEV drivers have asked themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Which raises another question: Why bother with PHEVs at all?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PHEVs have been touted as a way to ease cautious consumers into full EVs. The argument goes something like this: Drivers will become habituated with plugging in while EV charging networks are built out. By the time they’re ready for their next vehicle, the networks will be ready and customers can ease into an EV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if nobody is plugging in their PHEVs, they’re definitely not developing the habit. Without full charges, the electric drivetrain isn’t benefiting anyone. The public still suffers from worse air pollution, and drivers are carting around hundreds of pounds of weight and enduring <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/777965/stellantis-jeep-plug-in-hybrid-fire-recall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more recalls</a> and costlier service visits as a result of the complex drivetrain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tweaking the PHEV formula to make them more reliant on batteries could help. The interim solution is called an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), and it’s designed to run on battery power until the charge is depleted, at which point the fossil fuel engine recharges it. So far, no EREV has required the owner to plug in — they could easily drive the vehicle for its lifetime on gas. BMW used to make an EREV in the i3, but it stopped production years ago. Ford and Stellantis have both announced EREV pickup trucks, which have yet to go on sale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, EV charging networks <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/785615/america-ev-fast-charging-record-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">continue to expand</a>. It’s possible that by the time automakers are making PHEVs and EREVs in large quantities, drivers will no longer need a comfort blanket in the form of a gas engine. (My household came to that conclusion two years ago. After a decade split between a BMW i3 EREV and a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid PHEV, we traded up for a Kia EV9.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Legacy automakers, which have second-guessed their electrification strategies more times than I care to count, could be forced to change tack once more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PHEVs might have been a nifty solution on paper, but they’ve failed to deliver in the real world. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

New Relic is no different. As the data observability company launches an AI agent platform of its own, it knows it isn’t the only game in town.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New Relic on Tuesday unveiled a no-code agentic platform that lets enterprises put together data observability AI agents that monitor a company’s data to catch bugs and issues before they disrupt products. Called New Relic Agentic Platform, it lets companies deploy prebuilt agents and manage existing bots as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also supports the model context protocol (MCP), which connects AI applications to external data sources and integrates with other New Relic tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New Relic isn’t looking to be the only platform that companies use to manage and deploy all of their AI agents, Brian Emerson, the startup’s new chief product officer, told TechCrunch. Instead, the aim is to offer clients the same agent-building capabilities they are getting elsewhere for observability as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not building this as general purpose,” Emerson said. “We’re building it for outcomes that we care about inside observability. It’s also a world that allows us to work with the rest of the ecosystem or tools that exist out there, but bring it back into the context of problems we’re trying to solve around our personas and the observability domain.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Software that lets users manage AI agents has proliferated in recent months as companies look to figure out how to quell enterprises’ fears about giving AI agents access to their data and software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce was arguably the first to release an agent platform in late 2024, calling it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/salesforce-announces-agentforce-360-as-enterprise-ai-competition-heats-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Agentforce</a>. OpenAI launched its own version of the technology, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-a-way-for-enterprises-to-build-and-manage-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI Frontier</a>, earlier this year. Research organization Gartner has <a href=\"https://www.parloa.com/guides-ebooks-and-reports/gartner-ai-agent-sprawl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called</a> such agent platforms “necessary infrastructure” and a critical component of getting enterprises to adopt AI.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sticking with the theme of increasing enterprise tech adoption, New Relic also revealed new tools focused on OpenTelemetry (OTel), an open source observability framework.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said its application performance monitoring (APM) agents are now equipped with OTel capabilities, letting enterprises manage OTel data streams alongside their other data sources in one place. This is aimed at solving a previous fragmentation problem that was holding up mass enterprise adoption of the OTel framework.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just send your OTel data to us,” Nic Benders, chief technology strategist at New Relic, said. “What we’ve discovered in this process is that it’s kind of a burden for a lot of teams out there in the world to run all of the OTel [data] collectors. So having an OTel like fleet management is something that’s very important.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Select riders who have downloaded the Waymo app will receive an invitation to take their first rides, starting Tuesday. New riders will be added on a rolling basis, and eventually anyone who downloads the app will be able to hail a ride.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The addition of the new cities adds a striking dimension to Waymo’s fast-paced push to expand. Last February, Waymo was operating commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix and some of its surrounding suburbs, parts of Los Angeles, and San Francisco. At the time, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo was providing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/waymo-has-doubled-its-weekly-robotaxi-rides-in-less-than-a-year/\">more than 200,000 rides</a> every week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past 12 months, Waymo has expanded in its existing markets, particularly in San Francisco, where its service area now <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.google.com/waymo/answer/9059119?hl=en\">stretches down Highway 101</a> through numerous towns, all the way to San Jose. It now has access to three airports, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-sfo-airport-robotaxis/\">San Francisco International</a>. It has launched a service in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/uber-users-in-austin-are-getting-matched-with-waymo-robotaxis/\">partnership with Uber</a> in Atlanta and Austin. It has expanded its operating domain <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-giving-rides-on-freeways-in-these-3-cities/\">to freeways</a> in three cities. And last month it opened its robotaxi service to the public <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/waymo-continues-robotaxi-ramp-up-with-miami-service-now-open-to-public/\">in Miami</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo tends to hold back on its latest ridership numbers. The last time it provided an update, Waymo said it was providing more than <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2026/02/waymo-raises-usd16-billion-investment-round\">400,000</a> rides per week, though the actual number is likely higher by now. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo doesn’t appear to be slowing down, either. It is planning to launch robotaxi services in several more cities this year, including Denver, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/waymo-plans-to-launch-a-robotaxi-service-in-london-in-2026/\">London</a>, and Washington, D.C., to name a few. And it is now armed with an additional <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/waymo-raises-16-billion-round-to-scale-robotaxi-fleet-london-tokyo/\">$16 billion</a> raised in round led by Dragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital that values Waymo at $126 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo currently has a fleet of about 3,000 robotaxis that are spread across its six markets of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. That fleet size will likely grow with the addition of these four new cities, but don’t expect it to balloon immediately.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli said it will have dozens of vehicles to start in these cities, and will scale up in coordination with riders over the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s workforce will also scale alongside this expansion. The staff who monitor the robotaxis and respond to specific requests for information from the Waymo self-driving system — for instance, if a robotaxi encounters a tricky scenario on public roads — may expand, although Waymo wouldn’t share specifics. The company said only that it has an extensive planning process to ensure that its operations are right-sized to its scale as it grows. Waymo recently revealed it employs about 70 of these workers, whom it describes as remote assistance workers, or RAs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this is pushing toward a lofty goal Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana laid out last year — and one that hasn’t changed even as the company faces increased scrutiny and investigations by safety regulators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation after one of Waymo’s robotaxis last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-robotaxi-hits-a-child-near-an-elementary-school-in-santa-monica/\">struck a child</a> at 6 miles per hour near a school in Santa Monica. The National Transportation Safety Board is also examining how Waymo robotaxis <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/\">behave around school buses</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Waymo is serving more riders than ever, as we are on track to serve over one million rides per week by the end of this year,” said Mawakana <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2026/02/dallas-houston-san-antonio-orlando\">said in a blog post </a>Tuesday, adding that the company is laying the groundwork for robotaxi service in more than 20 cities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Believe it or not, web search is still thriving as an industry. As businesses invest in using AI agents to make the most of their data, there’s demand for tools that not only scrape the web to inform what those AI bots do, but also return those results in a way that’s easier to use with modern data tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the promise behind web search startup <a href=\"https://www.nimbleway.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nimble</a>, which recently raised a $47 million Series B round, led by Norwest. The New York company’s platform employs AI agents to search the web in real time, verify and validate the results, and structure the information into neat tables that can then be queried like a database.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That last part is crucial here. LLMs and AI agents are great for searching the web, connecting results from a variety of sources, and analyzing them, but they often return the results in plain text, which can be difficult to work with at an enterprise level. And that’s before you factor in hallucinations, the risk of the agent misunderstanding your instructions, or the use of unreliable sources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By validating and structuring results into tables, Nimble lets companies use web data as if it were already part of their existing databases. The startup also integrates with enterprise data warehouses and data lakes — large centralized repositories where businesses store and analyze data — offered by the likes of Databricks and Snowflake. That means its AI agents can plug into a business’s trove of data, using it to build context and shape how search results are structured and returned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In effect, this lets enterprises have live, structured web data as part of their existing data environments, Nimble CEO and co-founder Uri Knorovich (pictured above, middle) told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such integrations also allow Nimble’s software to remember constraints — such as how you want the search to be performed, or which data sources to tap. This is particularly useful for applications such as competitor analysis, pricing research, know-your-customer (KYC) processes, brand monitoring, deep research, and financial analysis. (Knorovich noted that Nimble works to ensure all customer data remains within customers’ data infrastructure to comply with data retention and security policies.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To that end, the startup has partnered with Databricks, Snowflake, AWS, and Microsoft to help streamline enterprise deployments that require access to internal data sources. (Databricks also participated in this Series B.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Models can do a lot of things, but most production AI fails aren’t because the models are not good enough — it’s because of a data failure,” Knorovich said. “What we’re seeing today is that enterprises don’t need more AI; they need AI with good, reliable web search … If you nail it down, if you can choose what your agent can search and cannot search, this is the tipping point for enterprises to say, ‘Hey we can actually trust AI. We can actually put AI to work in more use cases.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Knorovich says the ability to search the web in real time at scale, and validate and structure search results, is what sets Nimble apart from other data brokers already in the space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently has more than 100 customers, with the majority of its revenue coming from large enterprises, Fortune 500 companies, and even some Fortune 10 companies, including major retailers, hedge funds, banks, and consumer packaged goods companies, as well as some AI-native startups.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nimble is tackling a problem that has existed for years without a proper solution and is now becoming of critical urgency,” Assaf Harel, partner at Norwest, said in a statement. “Trusted live web data is increasingly becoming a prerequisite for AI agents performing critical business decisions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series B also saw participation from returning investors Target Global, Square Peg, Hetz Ventures, Slow Ventures, R-Squared Ventures, J-Ventures, and InvestInData. Proceeds from the round will be used to expand R&amp;D in multi-agent web search and a governed data layer that processes and validates search results. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nimble has now raised a total of $75 million.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
