A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, and the safety board will publish a more detailed final report in 12 to 24 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s the first time Waymo has been investigated by the NTSB, but it’s the second investigation launched into Waymo over its school bus problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opened a similar probe in October</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo also issued <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/waymo-to-issue-software-recall-over-how-robotaxis-behave-around-school-buses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a software recall</a> last year to address the problem. But previous software updates have not been enough to stamp it out, and in Austin, Texas — where the bulk of incidents have been captured on camera — the school district has asked the company to suspend operations during pickup and drop-off times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new investigation comes as Waymo is in the middle of a rapid expansion around the United States. Just this week, the company started offering a robotaxi service in Miami, adding to its operations in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We safely navigate thousands of school bus encounters weekly across the United States, and the Waymo Driver is continuously improving. There have been no collisions in the events in question, and we are confident that our safety performance around school buses is superior to human drivers,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We see this as an opportunity to provide the NTSB with transparent insights into our safety-first approach.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NTSB is different from the NHTSA in that it is not a federal regulatory agency. It cannot issue fines or penalties. Rather, the safety board usually performs deep investigations to identify root causes of problems in the transportation world. When an investigation is complete, the board often holds hearings and issues non-binding recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first notable incident where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus happened last September in Atlanta. The Waymo pulled out of a driveway and crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from the bus’ right side. The robotaxi then turned left and proceeded down the street while kids were getting off the bus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said at the time that the vehicle was unable to see the stop sign or flashing lights, and has since said that it addressed this particular scenario with a software update.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as Waymo patched the specific scenario it encountered in Atlanta, some of the company’s vehicles were caught passing stopped school buses in Austin, Texas. Local news outlet KXAN published videos it received from cameras mounted on school buses that showed Waymo vehicles making illegal maneuvers on <a href=\"https://www.kxan.com/investigations/austin-school-district-said-waymo-continues-to-illegally-pass-its-buses-following-recall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">multiple occasions</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We continue to engage productively with the Austin Independent School District and applaud their reported success in reducing human-driven violations around school buses from 10,000+ a year,” Peña said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We will always cooperate with the relevant authorities and provide any necessary information in response to valid inquiries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deel’s statement then makes its own allegations against Rippling. It points to its own lawsuit that alleges its rival has been on a “smear campaign,” claiming it’s beating the competitor in the market, and adding, “the truth will win in court.” Rippling declined comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is arguably the biggest drama between two HR startups ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To recap, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/rippling-sues-deel-deel-denies-all-legal-wrongdoing-and-slack-is-the-main-witness/\">Rippling sued Deel</a> in May, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/rippling-calls-deel-a-criminal-syndicate-and-claims-4-other-competitors-were-spied-on-too/\">revised the suit in June</a>, alleging that its rival planted a corporate spy. The Rippling employee was caught in a sting operation and confessed to being a paid spy for Deel in an Irish court via a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/the-affidavit-of-a-rippling-employee-caught-spying-for-deel-reads-like-a-movie/\">sworn written statement that reads like a Hollywood movie.</a> The employee testified that he took Rippling’s sales leads, product roadmaps, customer account info, names of superstar employees, whatever was asked for, and handed it over to Deel executives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rippling’s suit, which is ongoing, charged its rival with violations of the federal racketeering law (known as the RICO statute and typically used against organized crime) among other laws it cited. But despite using phrases like “criminal syndicate,” this was a civil suit, not a criminal prosecution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deel countersuited Rippling, also alleging spying by impersonating a customer, among other claims.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-spy-lived-in-fear\">The spy lived in fear</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The man who confessed to spying agreed to testify in Rippling’s case, and Rippling agreed to pay him for legal and travel expenses, according to the man’s cooperation agreement released as a court document and seen by TechCrunch. Deel is now calling the man Rippling’s “paid witness.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the man also went back to court alleging that his family was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/rippling-spy-says-men-have-been-following-him-and-his-wife-is-afraid/\">living in terror because he believed men from Deel</a> were following him. Deel’s lawyer initially denied this but <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/06/25/us-hr-firm-deel-admits-it-instructed-discreet-surveillance-on-manager-at-centre-of-spy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">later discovered that Deel did hire surveillance</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-payment-to-the-spy\">Payment to the spy </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rippling scored the most recent win, at the end of November, <a href=\"https://www.rippling.com/blog/new-banking-records-prove-deel-paid-thief-who-stole-trade-secrets-from-rippling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">when it obtained bank records</a>. The records indicated that Deel transferred funds into an account held by the wife of Deel’s COO, and 56 seconds later that account transferred the same amount to an account held by the confessed spy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, another court document shows that Deel’s founder and CEO Alexandre Bouaziz, who has been called “the mastermind” of the spying plot in Rippling’s lawsuit, has hired high-powered lawyer William Frentzen to represent him. Frentzen is a partner with Morrison Foerster’s white-collar defense group and was formerly the chief of the corporate and securities fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rippling’s lawyer is none other than Alex Spiro of white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel. Spiro is a former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office who is known for his big personality and long list of celeb clients, ranging from Elon Musk to Jay-Z.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So it’s all sounding like a plot from a John Grisham novel, with a sprinkle of the show “Suits” on top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of this has stopped investors from backing Deel or Rippling. In October, Deel announced it hit <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/deel-hits-17-3b-valuation-after-raising-300m-from-big-name-vcs/\">a $17.3 billion valuation</a> after raising $300 million led by Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Rippling hit a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/rippling-raises-450m-at-a-16-8b-valuation-reveals-yc-is-a-customer/\">$16.8 billion valuation in May</a> after raising $450 million from investors like Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs Alternatives, and Y Combinator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/how-would-the-netflix-warner-bros-deal-reshape-hollywood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disrupt Hollywood</a> as we know it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix–WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-has-happened-so-far\">What has happened so far?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) <a href=\"https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revealed it was exploring a potential sale</a> after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/tv-burdened-wbd-will-struggle-cut-cord-2025-06-05/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declining cable viewership</a> and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/david-ellisons-paramount-seen-front-runner-warner-bros-discovery-deal-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Paramount</a> initially viewed as the frontrunner. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But ultimately, WBD’s board determined that Netflix’s offer was the most attractive, despite Paramount offering approximately $108 billion in cash. Paramount’s bid aimed to acquire the entire company, while Netflix’s offer focused specifically on the film, television, and streaming assets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Netflix recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/netflix-revises-offer-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-stave-off-paramount/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">amended its agreement</a> to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per WBD share, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. The deal is valued at approximately $82.7 billion. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-fierce-bidding-war\">A fierce bidding war</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even after Netflix emerged as the preferred buyer, tensions with Paramount remained high, as the rival company continued to pursue Warner Bros.’ assets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD</a> for several months. Still, the board repeatedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rejected</a> its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/paramount-files-lawsuit-against-warner-bros-amidst-controversial-netflix-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed a lawsuit</a> seeking more information about the Netflix deal.

Earlier this week, it was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/netflix-s-sarandos-to-testify-in-senate-hearing-on-warner-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the deal, a move that highlights just how seriously lawmakers are taking these concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, prominent lawmakers — Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal —  <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sen-elizabeth-warren-letter-doj-wbd-sale-paramount-1236430180/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division</a>, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Should regulators block the acquisition, Netflix would be obligated to pay a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/netflix-s-5-8-billion-breakup-fee-for-warner-among-largest-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$5.8 billion breakup fee</a>. It remains unclear whether Warner Bros. would remain an independent company or revisit previous acquisition proposals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-concerns-within-the-industry\">Concerns within the industry</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Reactions from the entertainment industry have been largely negative. <a href=\"https://www.wgaeast.org/wga-statement-on-the-acquisition-of-warner-bros-discovery-by-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Writers Guild of America</a> has been among the most vocal critics, demanding that the merger be blocked on antitrust grounds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, insiders worry that the acquisition will squeeze independent creators and diverse voices out of the spotlight, ultimately narrowing the range of stories that get told.

This type of malware, known as “wiper” malware, is designed to irreversibly destroy data on computers to prevent them from working. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ESET attributed the malware with “medium confidence” to the hacking group known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/27/state-sandworm-russian-hackers-ukraine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sandworm</a>, a unit within Russia’s military intelligence agency GRU, based on a “strong overlap” with its previous research into Sandworm’s past malware, including the group’s use of destructive malware to target Ukraine’s energy sector.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Independent journalist Kim Zetter <a href=\"https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/cyberattack-targeting-polands-energy-grid-used-a-wiper/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported</a> the news.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As noted by Zetter, the cyberattacks targeting Poland come almost exactly a decade after Sandworm’s first-known cyberattack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in 2015, which caused power outages for more than 230,000 homes around Kyiv, the country’s capital. A similar cyberattack hit Ukraine’s energy systems a year later. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Following the attempted hack, Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said that the country’s cybersecurity defenses worked, and “at no point was critical infrastructure threatened.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Thursday, Google <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/thread/401524051/star-in-your-own-memes-introducing-me-meme-in-google-photos?hl=en&amp;sjid=10269612984587448974-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced</a> a new generative AI-powered feature called “Me Meme,” which will allow you to combine a photo template and an image of yourself to generate an image of the meme.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature, which will be first available to U.S.-based users, was originally <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-photos-meme-generator-apk-teardown-3609502/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spotted in development last October</a> by the blog Android Authority. It was formally <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/thread/401524051/star-in-your-own-memes-introducing-me-meme-in-google-photos?hl=en&amp;sjid=10269612984587448974-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> by Google via its Photos Community site on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Google, the feature is experimental, so generated images “may not perfectly match the original photo.” It suggests uploading well-lit, focused, and front-facing photos to get the best results.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The addition is meant to just be a fun way to explore your photos and experiment with Google’s Gemini AI technology, and specifically Nano Banana. Google’s popular AI image model <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/11/google-photos-adds-new-ai-features-for-editing-expands-ai-powered-search-to-over-100-countries/\">powers other AI features in the Google Photos app</a>, like the ability to re-create images in new styles, such as cartoons or paintings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though a fairly unserious addition, all things considered, these types of features help remind users to return to the Photos app whenever they want to play around with AI tools, rather than going to a competitor’s product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, users tend to gravitate toward features that show themselves in AI edits, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/openais-sora-soars-to-no-1-on-the-u-s-app-store/\">OpenAI found with its successful launch</a> of the Sora app, which lets you make AI videos that can include yourself and your friends. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Me Meme” isn’t fully rolled out, so you may not see it in your updated Google Photos app just yet. When available, it will appear under the “Create” tab, Google says. A rep for Google told TechCrunch the feature will reach U.S. iOS and Android users over the “coming weeks.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the feature, you’ll select a template or upload your own, then tap “add photo” and “Generate.” Google <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/16763021#me-meme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">notes</a> that more templates are being added over time.

The company mentioned that it is not abandoning its efforts but wants to develop an updated version of AI characters for teens, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes days before a case against Meta is set to go to trial in New Mexico, in which the company is accused of not making an effort to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its apps. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-child-safety-trial-ask-judge-bar-mental-health-harvard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wired</a> reported Thursday that Meta has sought to limit discovery related to social media’s impact on teen mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/meta-previews-new-parental-controls-for-its-ai-experiences/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the company previewed parental controls for AI characters</a>, allowing parents and guardians to monitor topics and block access to certain characters. Meta said parents would be able to completely turn off chats with AI characters. These features were set to release this year, but the company is now turning off AI characters altogether for teens while it updates the AI characters to a newer version.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens’ interactions with AI characters, which is why it decided to make these changes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been cracking down on teens’ access to AI content in its apps. Also in October, Meta rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/instagram-defaults-to-pg-13-content-for-teens-adds-more-parental-controls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">parental control features</a> on Instagram, focusing on tailoring the teen experience of interacting with AI on its apps.

This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology,” the company said in an updated blog post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta added that when it rolls out the new AI characters, they will have built-in parental controls. The company said that the new characters will give age-appropriate responses and will stick to topics like education, sport, and hobbies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Social media companies are under heavy scrutiny from regulators. Apart from the aforementioned case in New Mexico, Meta is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/snap-reaches-settlement-in-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">also facing a trial next week</a>, where the platform is accused of causing social media addiction. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to take the witness stand in that case once the trial begins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides social platforms, AI companies have had to modify their experience for teens after facing lawsuits alleging to play a part in aiding self-harm. In October, Character.AI, the startup that allows users to chat with various AI avatars, disallowed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/character-ai-is-killing-the-chatbot-experience-for-minors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">open-ended conversations with chatbots for users who were under 18</a>.

Last year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/tiktok-is-back-on-the-app-store-and-the-play-store-in-the-u-s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store</a> on February 2, 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after President Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle finally ceased. In <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-agrees-to-deal-to-cede-control-of-u-s-business-to-american-investor-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">December 2025</a>, TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier in 2025, President Trump had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/trump-and-bytedance-tout-tiktok-deal-approval-but-no-official-details-yet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced</a> that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform.

The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/27/trump-tiktok-decision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blocked</a> Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Things began to progress even more following the transition to the Biden administration. After the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/senate-passes-a-bill-forcing-tiktok-to-face-a-ban-if-bytedance-doesnt-sell-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Senate</a> passed the bill against TikTok, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/24/will-congress-ban-tiktok/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">President Joe Biden</a> signed it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/tiktok-sues-the-us-government-over-law-seeking-to-ban-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TikTok sued the U.S. government</a>, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fast-forward to 2024: <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-656/336151/20241227163400981_2024-12-27%20-%20TikTok%20v.%20Garland%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20President%20Donald%20J.%20Trump.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trump</a> had a change of heart since his first term and sought to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were several contenders, including <a href=\"https://www.thepeoplesbid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The People’s Bid for TikTok</a>, a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/billionaire-frank-mccourt-wants-to-buy-tiktok-heres-his-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Frank McCourt</a>.

In those jobs, he had seen the cost to access space come down dramatically, thanks in large part to Blue Origin’s rival SpaceX. Those stars in the sky, he thought, seemed closer than ever. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mitchell told TechCrunch that an idea finally clicked when he was attending a family member’s ash-spreading ceremony. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When it was over, we were kind of like, ‘now what?’ The moment was gone,” he said. He remembered thinking: “How could I do this better?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That, he said, was the beginning of building Space Beyond and its “Ashes to Space” program, which will use a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/what-are-smallsats-and-cubesats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CubeSat</a>, a class of miniature cube-shaped satellites, to send as many as 1,000 people’s ashes to space in one go. On Thursday, Space Beyond <a href=\"https://tech.einnews.com/pr_news/885561265/space-beyond-signs-launch-services-agreement-with-arrow-science-technology-for-first-space-memorials-mission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> it signed a launch services agreement with Arrow Science and Technology, which will integrate the CubeSat on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission scheduled for October 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sending people’s ashes to space is not a new idea. Companies like Celestis have been doing it since the 1990s. What Mitchell said is different about Space Beyond is that it’s doing it affordably — with its cheapest offering coming in at just $249. Other options typically cost in the thousands of dollars. (That said, customers will need to have the cremation performed elsewhere.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mitchell said Space Beyond has achieved this a few ways. Foremost is the rideshare model, which has greatly democratized access to space in general. Companies can now develop small CubeSats that get integrated into larger spacecraft for a fraction of the total price to hitch a ride on a Falcon 9, allowing for all sorts of new science and small-scale commercial missions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Space Beyond is also bootstrapped and not trying to generate big returns for investors.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve been told I’m not charging enough for this service,” he said, especially when considering how the funeral industry is built around over-charging people at one of their most vulnerable moments. “But I’m not looking to take over the world, and I’m not looking to make a billion dollars doing this.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are limits to what Space Beyond can offer, given the CubeSat format. For one, customers will only be able to send about one gram’s worth of ashes to space. This allows for the startup to fit enough customers’ ashes on board to make the idea financially viable. But it’s also a result of the fact that — despite the easier access to space — weight is still a huge consideration for launch providers like SpaceX.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Space Beyond’s CubeSat will also only be in orbit for about five years, so this is not a memorial that will last forever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Mitchell said there are benefits to this approach. The company’s CubeSat will be in what’s known as a “sun-synchronous orbit,” which is at a very high altitude of around 550 kilometers (or around 341 miles). This allows the satellite to fly over the entire globe. With many modern spacecraft tracking services available, customers should be able to locate the CubeSat and know when it is in the night sky above their home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A five-year limit also means that the aluminum CubeSat and the ashes onboard will ultimately meet a fiery end as it burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere upon re-entry — a nice symbolic ending, Mitchell said, even if there’s no guarantee that customers will be able to see the resulting fireball.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Space Beyond will also never physically spread a customer’s ashes in space. That would be “almost a nightmare scenario,” Mitchell said, as the particles could create a debris cloud that could doom other spacecraft. But given that customers can only send around one gram per space, they’ll be able to do what they want with the rest of a loved one’s ashes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Mitchell left Blue Origin last year, he said he filled “several pages” of a notebook with ideas of what to do next. The range was wide, including options like trying to be a launch director at another space company, or becoming a Kava bartender. Something kept pulling him back to this one, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I tried to talk myself out of [this idea] for a long time. I thought it would be too expensive or too difficult,” he explained. But he said it just made sense to him “every time I put actual engineering rigor to it, figured out what the requirements are, and what the business case is.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was also the idea that he was clearly most obsessed with. “My wife said: ‘I could have told you that weeks ago. You can’t stop talking about this,’” he said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News <a href=\"https://www.guampdn.com/news/another-unsealed-warrant-encrypted-data-seized-in-pua-fraud-investigation/article_1b98b770-daf5-436a-97f9-3a11f57accf5.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">covered</a> the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, <a href=\"https://kanditnews.com/3rd-warrant-against-tenorio-unsealed-encrypted-computer-files-seized/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also reported</a> in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social/post/3md3vciumvk2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised the potential scenario</a> where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/microsoft-lost-keys-government-hacked/\">has happened</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/hackers-breached-microsoft-to-find-out-what-microsoft-knows-about-them/\">several times</a> in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social/post/3md3vnprijk2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on Bluesky</a>. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Did he recognize her? Will her secret get out? Pay 60 “tokens” to see what happens next, or you can watch an ad, or… just buy a VIP pass for $20 per week and skip the ads altogether.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These stories are pulpy and exaggerated, bursting with cringeworthy acting and writing. Yet these “microdramas” — TikTok-like shows with episodes about a minute long — are making billions of dollars a year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First popular in China, microdrama apps are poised to have a breakout year in the U.S. app market. According to the app intelligence firm Appfigures, ReelShort reached roughly $1.2 billion in gross consumer spending in 2025, up 119% from 2024; another leading app, DramaBox, made $276 million in gross consumer spending last year, more than doubling its 2024 numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The market doesn’t appear to be slowing down. TikTok just launched its own standalone microdrama app called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/tiktok-quietly-launches-a-micro-drama-app-called-pinedrama/\">PineDrama</a>, and a new app from Hollywood veterans called <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/10/miramax-bill-block-gammatime-1236595530/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GammaTime</a> just raised $14 million, including checks from angel investors like Alexis Ohanian, Kris Jenner, and Kim Kardashian. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085464\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png 878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=430,273 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=720,458 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=800,508 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=668,425 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=590,375 590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=708,450 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.12.43-AM.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Appfigures Intelligence</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s surprising to see short-form, scripted drama apps achieve such success when we’re only five years removed from the implosion of Quibi. Quibi wanted to be like Netflix, but with 10-minute episodes that were designed to be watched on the go. Founded by Dreamworks co-founder and former Disney chair Jeffrey Katzenberg, Quibi raised more than $1.75 billion in funding from major Hollywood studios, then created shows with stars like Liam Hemsworth, Reese Witherspoon, and Anna Kendrick.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No one wanted Quibi, and the app turned into a punchline because of how massively it flopped. But ReelShort –- an app whose top shows are called “My Sister Is the Warlord Queen” and “In Love with a Single Farmer-Daddy” –- is a hit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“How are they succeeding where Quibi failed? They’re basically OnlyFans for the female gaze,” Eric Wei, creator economy expert and CEO of Karat Financial, told TechCrunch. “They do romantasy, where the titles are all like, ‘My Alpha.’ This is like ‘50 Shades of Grey,’ but for vertical video.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OnlyFans isn’t the best comparison (these shows can be suggestive, though not pornographic), but Wei is right that sex sells. When a story seems like it might be heating up, you’ll be prompted to watch ads or pay money to keep going. But the payoff is never that compelling, so you keep watching, only to see another pop-up asking for more money, or other ambiguous in-app currency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The business model behind these apps replicates the same dark patterns as mobile games. They’re designed to get users hooked on free content, giving out free in-app currency for logging in each day. As people spend more time on the app — which is designed to be addictive — they need more coins or tokens to unlock more episodes of a show, but there’s no way to earn enough to get their fix without shelling out real money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sometimes a microdrama is interactive, allowing viewers to choose which route the story will take — but the good option (the woman stands up to her abusive ex) will cost tokens, while the less satisfying one (the abusive ex faces no consequences for his actions) is free.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon, a hooked viewer may relent and pay for the weekly $20 ad-free pass, which, after a month, would cost more than subscriptions to HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Paramount Plus combined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI enters the picture, these companies will churn out content at an even more alarming pace. LLMs are not capable of writing prestige dramas like HBO’s “Succession,” or even a sitcom like “The Big Bang Theory,” but the most successful microdramas are so predictable and formulaic that they don’t actually require much human wit and creativity. You’d be shocked to learn how many microdramas begin with a scene in which a girl with glasses gets pushed down by a mean classmate, only to be saved by some popular jock, who notices she’s actually really pretty if she just takes off her glasses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PocketFM, the Lightspeed-backed audio-series platform, has already embraced AI. Last year, it released a tool it calls <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/pocket-fm-gives-its-writers-an-ai-tool-to-transform-narratives-write-cliffhangers-and-more/\">CoPilot</a>, which was trained on thousands of hours of content to understand the “beats” of a formulaic story, helping writers add cliffhangers or plot twists to their stories that it predicts will make audiences want to watch more. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian company Holywater, which raised <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/15/holywater-microdrama-app-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$22 million</a> to fund its microdrama app My Drama, calls itself an “AI-first entertainment network.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While microdrama could fully go the way of AI, Dhar Mann Studios CEO Sean Atkins thinks there’s also an opportunity for creators. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Think about it — short-form is a little less overhead than long-form, and vertical is even less overhead,” Atkins told TechCrunch. “I think you’ll see a handful of creators start going into that pretty significantly, particularly since they have the experience of low-cost production.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies have a great business model on their hands. But it’s one that thrives on short attention spans, in-app purchases, and content that feels like “Cocomelon” for adults.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The visit comes as New Delhi prepares to host a major AI summit expected to draw top executives from Meta, Google, and Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is hosting its first major AI event — the <a href=\"https://impact.indiaai.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">India AI Impact Summit 2026</a> — in New Delhi between February 16 and 20, bringing together global technology leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei alongside key Indian business figures like Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, per the summit’s <a href=\"https://impact.indiaai.gov.in/key-participants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">website</a>. Altman is not currently listed as a confirmed attendee.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But TechCrunch has learned that OpenAI is separately planning to host closed-door meetings on the sidelines of the summit in New Delhi, where Altman is expected to be present. The company is also hosting an OpenAI event in New Delhi on February 19, with venture capitalists and industry executives invited, one person familiar with the matter said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman’s visit has not been publicly announced and plans could still change, the sources said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several other U.S. companies are also planning side events around the summit week. Anthropic is hosting a developers’ day in Bengaluru on February 16, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Nvidia is also set to hold an evening event in New Delhi during the summit week, people familiar with the plans told TechCrunch. (The GPU maker did not respond to requests for comment.) The cluster of events underscores how global AI firms are seeking to engage India’s enterprise customers, startup ecosystem, and developer community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The trip would mark Altman’s first visit to India in nearly a year, after he <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-altman-meets-with-india-it-minister-discuss-countrys-ai-plans-2025-02-05/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">traveled to the country</a> in February 2025.

India has emerged as <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/openai-in-india-what-the-chatgpt-maker-is-doing-in-the-country.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT’s biggest market by downloads</a> and <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/india-emerges-as-openais-second-largest-market-cto-srinivas-narayanan/articleshow/125094943.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">second largest by users</a>. Still, OpenAI has faced challenges converting that demand into paid subscriptions, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">introducing a lower-priced “ChatGPT Go” plan</a> last year priced under $5 and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">offering it free for a year</a> to drive uptake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman is expected to meet key tech executives, startup founders, and government officials during the trip, the sources said, as OpenAI looks to expand ChatGPT’s enterprise adoption while still broadening its reach as a mass-market product. The company has been engaging with multiple sectors in India, including education and media, the people added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is also looking at India as a potential base for infrastructure expansion, the sources said. Last year, both Google and Microsoft announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">multibillion-dollar investments</a> in India to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-to-invest-17-5b-in-india-by-2029-as-ai-race-accelerates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expand their AI and cloud footprint</a>. But India’s data-center ambitions <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-file-100-billion-data-centre-boom-tests-resource-limits-2025-12-03/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">face constraints</a>, including uneven power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating costs for cloud providers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the Indian government is hopeful that the upcoming summit will cement India’s status as a destination for large-scale AI investment. The country’s IT minister said in a recent interview that the event could help <a href=\"https://x.com/chandrarsrikant/status/2014362933396926574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">attract as much as $100 billion</a> in investment. The federal government is also pushing domestic startups to <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2216901&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">build smaller models</a> for local use cases, eventually reducing reliance on U.S.-based systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI, India’s IT ministry, and the AI summit’s organizers did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-marketing-for-autopilot-and-full-self-driving-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deceptive marketing</a> by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It’s not clear if current customers are affected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision comes one week after the company said that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/tesla-will-only-offer-subscriptions-for-full-self-driving-supervised-going-forward/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">starting on February 14</a>, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2014539856890716418?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a post</a> on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software’s capabilities improve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk believes that Tesla’s newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/musk-says-new-tesla-software-allows-texting-and-driving-which-is-illegal-in-most-states/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">texting while driving is illegal in almost all states</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Tesla rolled out the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/tesla-launches-robotaxi-rides-in-austin-with-no-human-safety-driver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first robotaxi versions</a> of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software and are still followed by the company’s cars for supervision.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-full-self-driving-sales-customers-pay-fsd-2025-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/06/musks-1t-pay-package-is-full-of-watered-down-versions-of-his-own-broken-promises/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">required for Musk to receive the full payout</a> of his new $1 trillion pay package. <br><br>Tesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-07/tesla-ceo-talking-with-google-about-autopilot-systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">after talks broke down</a> between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant’s then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/en_ae/support/autopilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">all of its vehicles in April 2019</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across the decade-plus of Autopilot’s existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software’s capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/26/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-closed-fatal-crashes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Thursday, he announced that he has revived an idea he began working on as a student at Harvard about 10 years ago, turning it into the AI calendar-scheduling company Blockit. In a major vote of confidence, Khimji’s former employer, Sequoia, led the company’s $5 million seed round.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Blockit has a chance to become a $1Bn+ revenue business, and Kais will make sure it gets there,” Pat Grady, Sequoia’s general partner and co-steward who led the investment, wrote in a <a href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/the-most-precious-resource/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many startups have tried to automate scheduling in the past, Khimji believes that thanks to advances in LLMs, Blockit’s AI agents can handle scheduling more seamlessly and efficiently than many of its predecessors, including now-defunct startups Clara Labs and x.ai. (Yes, that domain name ended up with Elon Musk’s AI company.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the current category leader Calendly, which was last valued at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$3 billion</a> and relies on users sharing links to find availability, Blockit is betting that its AI agents can master the nuance required to handle the entire scheduling process without human involvement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Blockit, Khimji and co-founder John Han — who previously worked on calendar products, including Timeful, Google Calendar, and Clockwise — are building what is essentially an AI social network for people’s time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It always felt very odd. I have a time database — my calendar. You have a time database — your calendar, and our databases just can’t talk to each other,” Khimji told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khimji says that Blockit can finally solve this disconnection. When two users need to meet, their respective AI agents communicate directly to negotiate a time, bypassing the typical back-and-forth emails entirely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can invoke the Blockit agent by copying it on an email or messaging it in Slack about a meeting. The bot then takes over the logistics, negotiating a mutually convenient time and location that fits the preferences of all participants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khimji said that Blockit can work as seamlessly as a human executive assistant. Users simply need to provide the system with specific instructions about their preferences, such as which meetings are nonnegotiable and which are “movable” based on daily needs. “Sometimes my calendar is crazy, so I need to skip lunch, and the agent needs to know that it’s okay to skip lunch,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system can even be trained to prioritize meetings based on the tone of an email. For instance, a user might instruct the agent that a meeting request signed with a formal “Best regards” should take precedence over a casual interaction ending with “Cheers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By learning the preferences of its users, Blockit appears to be capitalizing on what venture firm Foundation Capital’s partners Jaya Gupta and Ashu Garg call “context graphs.” In a <a href=\"https://foundationcapital.com/context-graphs-ais-trillion-dollar-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">widely shared essay</a>, the investors describe a multibillion-dollar opportunity for AI agents to capture the “why” behind every business decision by relying on the hidden logic that previously only existed in a person’s head.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blockit is already being used by more than 200 companies, including AI startup Together.ai, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/capital-one-acquires-brex-for-steep-discount-to-its-peak-valuation-but-early-believers-are-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">newly acquired</a> fintech company Brex, and robotics startup Rogo, as well as venture firms a16z, Accel, and Index. The app is available for free for 30 days. After that, it costs $1,000 annually for individual users and $5,000 annually for a team license with support for multiple users, Khimji said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Luckey told TechCrunch that these will be new jobs, not transfers from other operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anduril’s headquarters is nearby, in Costa Mesa, California, and it also has a massive <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/16/anduril-to-build-its-billion-dollar-weapons-megafactory-in-ohio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">manufacturing facility in Ohio</a>. The Long Beach campus will span 1.18 million square feet across six buildings, combining office space and industrial areas dedicated to R&amp;D. It is expected to be ready by mid-2027, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long Beach is “a major aerospace hub right in our backyard,” Luckey told TechCrunch about why the company chose that location.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan is to hire similar types of employees to those working at headquarters: manufacturing workers, technicians, assembly workers, and engineers across disciplines (electrical, mechanical, aerodynamics), as well as build and test roles, and “a lot of people on the logistics side, because the things that we’re going to be making there, we’re going to be sending all over the world,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While bringing thousands of jobs to his childhood town made headlines today, Luckey said the most exciting part for him about Anduril’s general expansion was the fighter jets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It looks like we’re going to be able to manufacture autonomous fighter jets that will take off right from the factory and fly to wherever the customer needs them,” he said. “We might have jets leaving the factory, flying directly into combat.

That change will also mean the end of its rebooted Chevrolet Bolt EV, the only vehicle currently built at the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The factory musical chairs reflect an economic and political environment, shaped by the Trump administration’s tariff policy and its decision to end the federal EV tax credit, which provided up to $7,500 off qualifying electric vehicles. These changes have made it more expensive to build vehicles in China and Mexico that are then sold in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Production of the 2027 Chevy Bolt EV, which landed in dealerships this month, is expected to end in about a year and a half. The new Chevy Bolt EV, which is priced at $29,990 including the destination fee, is one of the most affordable new EVs available to U.S. consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM confirmed to TechCrunch that the next-generation Buick Envision, currently built in China, will move to the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas, beginning in 2028. The gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox, which is made in the San Luis Potosí plant in Mexico, will move to the Kansas factory in mid-2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bolt, meanwhile, will have a short life if GM follows through with its previously announced plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we revealed Bolt in October, we said and it was widely reported that it’d be a limited run model,” a GM spokesperson said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. “We had also previously announced the gas-powered Equinox would be coming to Fairfax in mid 2027 after Bolt production ramps down. Today we’re announcing the next-generation Buick compact SUV will come to Fairfax beginning in 2028.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company still sells other EVs, including an electric Chevy Equinox and Chevy Blazer. The question is whether GM will change course and save the Bolt if sales are better than expected. We do know that GM has promised to make new future investments in Fairfax Assembly for its next generation of affordable EVs. We just don’t know when. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
