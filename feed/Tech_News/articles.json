The tech giant said the new subscriptions will unlock more productivity and creativity, along with expanded AI capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the coming months, Meta said it will offer a premium experience on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp that gives users access to special features and more control over how they share and connect, while keeping the core experiences free. Meta doesn’t appear to be locked into one strategy, noting that it will test a variety of subscription features and bundles, and that each app subscription will have a distinct set of exclusive features. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta also shared that it plans to scale Manus, an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/meta-just-bought-manus-an-ai-startup-everyone-has-been-talking-about/\">AI agent it recently acquired</a> for a reported $2 billion, as part of its subscription plans. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta is taking a two-fold approach to Manus. The company is  going to integrate Manus into Meta products, while continuing to sell standalone subscriptions to businesses. Meta has already been spotted working on adding a shortcut to Manus AI on Instagram, according to a screenshot shared by reverse engineer <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/2014657063310307706\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Meta plans to test subscriptions for AI features, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/meta-launches-vibes-a-short-form-video-feed-of-ai-slop/\">Vibes video generation</a>. Vibes is Meta’s AI-powered short-form video experience built into the Meta AI app that lets people create and remix AI-generated videos. Although Vibes has been free since its launch last year, Meta now plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s unknown what the paid features on WhatsApp and Facebook will look like, <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/2014472785976807836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Paluzzi notes</a> that the new subscription on Instagram will let users create unlimited audience lists, the ability to see a list of followers who don’t follow you back, and the option to view a Story without the poster seeing that you viewed it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that the new subscriptions will be separate from Meta Verified. The tech giant says it’s going to use what it learned from Meta Verified to evolve its subscription business to include more offerings it thinks everyday users, creators, and businesses will want.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta Verified is aimed at content creators and businesses, as it comes with a verified badge, 24/7 direct support, impersonation protections, search optimization, exclusive stickers, and more. While these features aren’t aimed at everyday users or non-creators, the new subscriptions will be designed for a broader audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch of additional subscriptions will allow Meta to generate more revenue; however, many users may be deterred by subscription fatigue. With so many paid services competing for monthly spending, Meta will have to offer a compelling product to get users to sign up for yet another subscription.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, as its Snapchat+ offering continues to be a revenue driver. Snapchat+, which starts at $3.99 per month for exclusive features, has topped 16 million subscribers, more than doubling since early 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it plans to listen to its community of users and gather feedback as it starts rolling out the subscriptions in the coming months.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Renee Nicole Good was killed on January 7, and ICU nurse Alex Pretti lost his life on January 24. Many travelers also said they’re worried about unpredictable border checks and safety concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As one person put it, “It’s not worth taking the risk of going.” Another chimed in: “The U.S. is just a very problematic location for an international event.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GDC, now rebranded as the “GDC Festival of Gaming,” is scheduled to take place in San Francisco from March 9 to 13.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others cited general concerns over safety as well as cost as factors in their decision not to attend. Some indie developers and small studios have said the costs, which include hotel, food, travel, and the ticket price, are just too high.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to these concerns, GDC president Nina Brown told <a href=\"https://mobilegamer.biz/many-international-visitors-are-skipping-gdc-this-year-amid-cost-concerns-and-us-safety-fears/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mobilegamer.biz</a>, that the “safety of our community is always our top priority.” In a statement, Brown said the GDC works closely with “local officials and legal experts to monitor U.S. policy changes” and to provide the most up-to-date guidance. Brown also advised international attendees to start their visa applications early and consult with their embassies regarding any special requirements.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Brown also outlined several safety measures, including that GDC offers a 24/7 safety hotline, safety training for event staff, and security escorts upon request. San Francisco’s Safety Community Ambassadors program will also be present, providing additional support to attendees throughout the event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has also reached out to GDC for comment and will update this article if the organization responds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the cost front, GDC has <a href=\"https://x.com/Official_GDC/status/1981390546217120087?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced</a> a simpler, more affordable ticketing system to make the event more accessible to smaller developers and indie studios. The new Festival Pass replaces the previous All-Access pass and is 45% cheaper, with pricing starting at $649 and providing access to all main event programming.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But i am very open to reading views from any other urban jurisdiction.” He instead <a href=\"https://x.com/rabois/status/2015501439792005585?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blamed</a> the city’s police for the situation: “Because the MN police’s refusal to cooperate is exactly what is leading to these treacherous conditions (for everyone).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And so on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X reacted as you might expect. Other Trump supporters cheered Rabois on, while those who condemn ICE’s actions argued with and condemned the investor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The situation spiraled so much that when <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/EthanChoi7/status/2015524019085451353\">one person suggested</a> that founders remove Khosla Ventures from their cap tables altogether, Khosla partner Choi piped up to distance himself.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Choi <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/EthanChoi7/status/2015524019085451353?s=20\">posted</a>: “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at @khoslaventures, at least not mine. What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then the founder of the firm, Khosla himself, stood by Choi. “I agree with @EthanChoi7. Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck [sic] empowered by a conscious-less administration,” he said in his <a href=\"https://x.com/vkhosla/status/2015647215642186008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on X</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under normal circumstances, opposing political points of view can be a strength for a VC firm. Whatever anyone thinks of Rabois’ politics, he’s been a very successful investor backing such companies as DoorDash, Affirm, Faire, and Stripe, as well as co-founding Opendoor, among other startups.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But sometimes they are internally disruptive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sequoia was embroiled in a controversy over partner Shaun Maguire’s comments attacking New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Maguire (whose <a href=\"https://x.com/shaunmmaguire/status/2015518632839979079\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">comments</a> over the weekend on ICE align with Rabois’) remains as an investor at Sequoia. But its leader at the time of the Mamdani controversy, Roelof Botha, stepped down as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/sequoia-names-alfred-lin-and-pat-grady-as-new-co-stewards-as-roelof-botha-steps-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">senior steward in November</a>. Botha was replaced by Alfred Lin and Pat Grady (neither of whom weighed in over the weekend).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this case, the rift between Khosla partners spilled out publicly. But note that Khosla did not directly chastise Rabois. (The company did not respond to our request for comment.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Khosla Ventures rehired Rabois in 2024, the firm knew it was bringing in an outspoken, self-proclaimed “contrarian” into its ranks, of the ilk that liked to blame the “woke” and <a href=\"https://x.com/rabois/status/2013369293715509467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">praise President Trump</a>. For Rabois’ part, he knew he would be working for a vocal Trump critic (Vinod Khosla has made his point of view on Trump very clear for years).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Will there be continued fallout? Perhaps — but only if founders really do start dumping Khosla Ventures from their cap tables.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Homeland Security has also leveraged the shadow of Trump’s deportations to challenge long-standing legal norms, including forcibly entering homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant, a move that legal experts say <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ice-arrests-warrants-minneapolis-trump-00d0ab0338e82341fd91b160758aeb2d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">violates the Fourth Amendment protections</a> against unreasonable searches and seizures. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here are some of the technologies that ICE is relying on.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cell-site-simulators\"><strong>Cell-site simulators</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ICE has a technology known as cell-site simulators to snoop on cellphones.

Once that happens, the law enforcement authorities who are using the cell-site simulators can locate and identify the phones in their vicinity, and potentially intercept calls, text messages, and internet traffic.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cell-site simulators are also known as “stingrays,” based on the brand name of one of the earliest versions of the technology, which was made by U.S. defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris); or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/02/who-catches-the-imsi-catchers-researchers-demonstrate-stingray-detection-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IMSI catchers</a>, a technology that can capture a nearby cell phone’s unique identifier, which law enforcement can use for identifying the phone’s owner.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the last two years, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/ice-bought-vehicles-equipped-with-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-phones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ICE has signed contracts for more than $1.5 million with a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV)</a>, which produces customized vans for law enforcement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A contract worth more than $800,000, dated May 8, 2025, said TOSV will provide “Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch that the company does not manufacture the cell-site simulators, but rather integrates them “into our overall design of the vehicle.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cell-site simulators have long been controversial for several reasons.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These devices are designed to trick all nearby phones to connect to them, which means that, by design, they gather the data of many innocent people. Also, authorities <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/report-ice-and-secret-service-conducted-illegal-surveillance-cell-phones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have sometimes deployed them</a> without first obtaining a warrant.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Authorities have also tried to keep their use of the technology secret in court, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/state-v-andrews-stingray-june-4-2015-transcript?redirect=state-v-andrews-stingray-june-4-2015-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">withholding information</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secrecy-around-police-surveillance-equipment-proves-a-cases-undoing/2015/02/22/ce72308a-b7ac-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">accepting plea deals</a> and <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/fbi-would-rather-prosecutors-drop-cases-than-disclose-stingray-details/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropping cases</a> rather than disclose information about their use of cell-site simulators. In a court case in 2019 in Baltimore, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20190429035346/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-stingray-case-20150408-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it was revealed</a> that prosecutors were instructed to drop cases rather than violate a non-disclosure agreement with the company that makes the devices.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-facial-recognition\">Facial recognition</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial-recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-spends-millions-on-clearview-ai-face-recognition-to-find-people-assaulting-officers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">404 Media reported</a> that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ICE <a href=\"https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=clearview+ai+UEI_NAME%3A%22CLEARVIEW+AI%2C+INC.%22++AGENCY_NAME%3A%22Immigration+and+Customs+Enforcement%22&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has had other contracts</a> with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clearview AI did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ICE is also using a facial-recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which federal agents use to identify people on the street. The app relies on scanning a person’s driver’s license photo against 200 million photos, much of the data sourced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/lawmakers-warn-democratic-governors-that-states-are-sharing-drivers-data-with-ice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from state driver’s license databases</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-paragon-phone-spyware\">Paragon phone spyware</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about ICE and the technology it uses? We would love to learn how this affects you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a><p> You also can contact TechCrunch via </p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/got-a-tip/\">SecureDrop</a><p>.\t\t</p></div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September 2024, ICE <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70CTD024P00000012_7012_-NONE-_-NONE-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed a contract</a> worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-paragon-contract-white-house-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">putting the contract under review</a> to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/ice-reactivates-contract-with-spyware-maker-paragon/\">effectively reactivating the contract</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this point, the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice is unclear.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The records entry from last week said that the contract with Paragon is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/about-ice/hsi/investigate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and more</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paragon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/israeli-spyware-maker-paragon-bought-by-u-s-private-equity-giant/\">American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon</a>, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company RedLattice, according to Israeli tech news site <a href=\"https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1ucev64kg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Calcalist</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications, Jennifer Iras. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/\">journalists</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/06/italian-lawmakers-say-italy-used-spyware-to-target-phones-of-immigration-activists-but-not-against-journalist/\">immigration activists</a>. In response, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/spyware-maker-paragon-terminates-contract-with-italian-government-media-reports/\">Paragon cut ties</a> with Italy’s intelligence agencies. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-phone-hacking-and-unlocking-technology\">Phone hacking and unlocking technology</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In mid-September, ICE’s law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/ice-unit-signs-new-3-million-contract-for-phone-hacking-tech/\">signed a contract with Magnet Forensics</a> for $3 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This contract is specifically for software licenses so that HSI agents can “recover digital evidence, process multiple devices,” and “generate forensic reports,” according to the contract description.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Magnet is the current maker of the phone hacking and unlocking devices known as Graykey. These devices essentially give law enforcement agents the ability to connect a locked phone to them, unlock it, and access the data inside of it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Magnet Forensics, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/20/thoma-bravo-agrees-to-acquire-digital-forensics-firm-magnet-forensics-for-over-1b/\">which merged with Graykey maker Grayshift</a> in 2023, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cellphone-location-data-nbsp\"><strong>Cellphone location data</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the end of September, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-to-buy-tool-that-tracks-locations-of-hundreds-of-millions-of-phones-every-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">404 Media reported</a> that ICE bought access to an “all-in-one” surveillance tool that allows the agency to search through databases of historical cellphone location data, as well as social media information.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool appears to be made of two products called Tangles and Webloc, which are made by a company called Penlink. One of the tools promises to leverage “a proprietary data platform to compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, providing both forensic and predictive analytics,” <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-to-buy-tool-that-tracks-locations-of-hundreds-of-millions-of-phones-every-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to a redacted contract found by 404 Media</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The redacted contract does not identify which one of the tools makes that promise, but given its description, it’s likely Webloc. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/18/ice-spends-millions-on-social-media-spy-tech-banned-by-meta-facebook/?ref=404media.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Forbes previously cited a case study</a> that said Webloc can search a given location to “monitor trends of mobile devices that have given data at those locations and how often they have been there.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This type of cellphone location data is harvested by companies around the world using software development kits (SDKs) embedded in regular smartphone apps, or with an online advertising process called real-time bidding (RTB), where companies bid in real-time to place an ad on the screen of a cellphone user based on their demographic or location data. The latter process has the by-product of giving ad tech companies that kind of personal data.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once collected, this mass of location data is transferred to a data broker who then sells it to government agencies. Thanks to this layered process, authorities have used this type of data without getting a warrant by simply purchasing access to the data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other tool, Tangles, is an “AI-powered open-source intelligence” tool that automates “the search and analysis of data from the open, deep, and the dark web,” <a href=\"https://www.penlink.com/platform/open-source-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Penlink’s official site</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/18/ice-spends-millions-on-social-media-spy-tech-banned-by-meta-facebook/?ref=404media.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Forbes reported</a> in September that ICE spent $5 million on Penlink’s two tools.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Penlink did not respond to a request for comment.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">License plate readers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ICE relies on automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies to follow drivers across a large swath of the U.S., noting where people go and when.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ICE also <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">leans on its connections with local law enforcement agencies</a>, which have contracts with ALPR providers, like surveillance company Flock Safety, to obtain immigration data by the back door. Flock is one of the largest ALPR providers, with over 40,000 license plate scanners around the United States, and only getting larger with its partnerships with other companies, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/amazons-ring-to-partner-with-flock-a-network-of-ai-cameras-used-by-ice-feds-and-police/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">video surveillance company Ring</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Efforts by ICE to informally request data from local law enforcement have prompted some police departments to <a href=\"https://www.vpm.org/news/2025-07-16/flock-license-plate-readers-ice-atf-rva-edwards-kaiser-aclu-cherian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cut off federal agencies</a> from their access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Border Patrol runs its own surveillance network of ALPR cameras, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-patrol-surveillance-drivers-ice-trump-9f5d05469ce8c629d6fecf32d32098cd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Associated Press reported</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lexisnexis-legal-and-public-records-databases\">LexisNexis’ legal and public records databases</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/09/records-show-ice-uses-lexisnexis-to-check-millions-far-more-than-previously-thought/\">which revealed</a> that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A year later, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2023/06/20/lexisnexis-ice-surveillance-license-plates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Intercept revealed</a> that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=LexisNexis+UEI_NAME%3A%22LEXISNEXIS%22++AGENCY_NAME%3A%22Immigration+and+Customs+Enforcement%22&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">According to public records</a>, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to subscribe to the service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-surveillance-giant-palantir\">Surveillance giant Palantir</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed <a href=\"https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/search.do?q=%22palantir%22+CONTRACTING_AGENCY_NAME%3A%22U.S.+IMMIGRATION+AND+CUSTOMS+ENFORCEMENT%22&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">several contracts</a> with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir <a href=\"https://www.palantir.com/newsroom/press-releases/homeland-security-investigations-renews-partnership-with-palantir/?ref=404media.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed</a> a $95.9 million deal with ICE. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/this-is-palantirs-justification-for-building-ices-master-database/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">particularly</a> <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/inside-a-powerful-database-ice-uses-to-identify-and-deport-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Palantir’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/leaked-palantirs-plan-to-help-ice-deport-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">relationship</a> with <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-just-paid-palantir-tens-of-millions-for-complete-target-analysis-of-known-populations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ICE</a>, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to 404 Media, “a source familiar with the database” said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/this-is-palantirs-justification-for-building-ices-master-database/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki</a> where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ice-palantir-new-technology-30-million-visa-overstays-self-deportation-2025-4?ref=404media.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revealed by Business Insider</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a <a href=\"https://sam.gov/opp/f71acee6010c423db4902446a59a690c/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">document</a> first <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported on by Wired</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>First published on September 13, 2025, and updated on September 18, 2025, to include Magnet Forensics’ new contract, again on October 8, 2025, to include cell-site simulators and location data, and again on January 26, 2026, to include license plate readers.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

One app gaining traction is <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">UpScrolled</a>, a social network that pledges to remain impartial to political agendas. The app currently ranks 12th overall in Apple’s App Store and second in the social networking category.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">UpScrolled</a> blends familiar features from Instagram and X, letting users share photos, videos, and text posts, discover new content, and send direct messages.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app was founded last year by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist, with the aim of giving users a place to “freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,” according to the <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">app’s website</a>. The team behind the app says they’re “building a platform that belongs to the people who use it — not to hidden algorithms or outside agendas.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“UpScrolled is the foundation for a digital ecosystem that puts power back into the hands of the people — not the corporations,” Hijazi said in a statement on UpScrolled’s website. “It’s more than just an alternative to Meta, X, or TikTok — it’s a reimagining of what social media should be: a space where creators, communities, and businesses thrive independently, with real control, transparency, and accountability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app, available on both <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/upscrolled/id6746533451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.upscrolled.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Android</a>, is grappling with a surge of new users but says it’s scaling to keep up with the demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to data from the market intelligence provider <a href=\"http://appfigures.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Appfigures</a>, UpScrolled saw approximately 41,000 downloads between Thursday, the day the TikTok deal was finalized, and Saturday, accounting for nearly one-third of its lifetime installs. UpScrolled has seen an average of about 14,000 daily downloads since Thursday, representing a 2,850% increase in daily downloads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, the app has been downloaded 140,000 times to date, with 75,000 of those being U.S.-based installs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Well, this is new … You showed up so fast our servers tapped out,” the company <a href=\"https://x.com/realUpScrolled/status/2015797730241601808\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a post</a> on X. “Frustrating? Yes. Emotional? Also yes. We’re a tiny team building what Big Tech stopped being. Right now we’re scaling on caffeine to keep up with what YOU started. Bear with us. We’re on it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The surge comes as TikTok announced last Thursday that it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-finalizes-deal-to-create-new-us-entity-and-avoid-ban/\">signed a deal</a> with a group of non-Chinese investors to form a majority American-owned joint venture to keep the social app operating in the U.S. TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new entity, while the venture’s three managing investors — Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment company MGX — each hold a 15% stake. Some users worry that TikTok’s new U.S. investors may have political allegiances to Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Following the takeover, some users accused the app of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2026/01/26/are-new-owners-censoring-tiktok-top-democrats-influencers-celebrities-raising-concerns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">potentially censoring certain political content</a>. This criticism included a handful of high-profile users, including <a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/2015582789647597939?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Senator Chris Murphy</a> and singer Billie Eilish, who raised concerns that TikTok was suppressing or limiting posts criticizing ICE. Additionally, some said they were unable to search for information about ongoing protests in Minneapolis following the killing of Alex Pretti by border patrol agents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, TikTok attributed these issues to an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-attributes-recent-glitches-to-a-power-outage-at-a-u-s-data-center/\">ongoing data center outage</a>, which has been impacting its app’s functionality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Concerns also grew when TikTok released an updated privacy policy that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-new-privacy-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">allows</a> the app to track users’ GPS coordinates, among other things. This led to some users encouraging people to delete the app in favor of alternatives, with UpScrolled being one of the popular choices, largely due to its <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">promise to not shadowban</a> anyone and give “every post a fair chance to be seen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UpScrolled isn’t the only app that’s seeing a surge in users following the takeover. Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on open source technology, says it has now topped <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-alternative-skylight-soars-to-380k-users-after-tiktok-u-s-deal-finalized/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">over 380,000 sign-ups</a> and is continuing to grow.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The first bid came in at $8 million, and parties traded bids until Life Electric Vehicles came away as the winner. When accounting for Rad Power’s liabilities, the total value of the bid is $14.9 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another e-bike company called Retrospec had the second-highest bid of $13 million and is being labeled as the “backup bidder” in case the deal with Life EV falls through. The bids were a steep discount to Rad Power’s peak $1.65 billion valuation, which was reached in October 2021, per PitchBook. The company has raised a total of $329.2 million, according to PitchBook data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy judge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power is not the only company in the micromobility world to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years. Peers like VanMoof and Cake went through restructurings and found new owners. Scooter company Bird also went through the bankruptcy process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear what Life EV plans to do with Rad Power; Life EV CEO Robert Provost directed questions to Rad Power. “There is still a process underway and there is an exciting future being planned for Rad Power,” he wrote in a message.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch was unable to reach Rad Power for comment; this article will be updated if the company responds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like many of those peers, Rad Power saw a huge increase in sales during the pandemic but struggled as that momentum dried up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company went through multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years, juggled CEOs, and more recently had trouble with some of its older batteries catching fire. The Consumer Product Safety Commission found 31 reported fires tied to the batteries.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power told TechCrunch at the time that it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, founders Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles are tasked with a bigger challenge: showing customers and investors how this AI-powered software layer translates to real savings on an industrial scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York-based startup has had some success following its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/this-industrial-ai-startup-is-winning-over-customers-by-saying-it-wont-get-acquired/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pre-seed funding round</a> last July. Its system is now running with real customers, including public utilities, advanced manufacturing facilities, and chemical producers. It’s given the duo more concrete examples of what problems they can solve — and money they can save — for their big industry clients.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the core things we’re witnessing,” he said, is customers “really lack the tool to translate a small action, like turning on and off a valve, [into] did that just save me money?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a homeowner with bills to pay, it’s a bit unnerving to think about one nondescript valve making such a big difference in the bottom line of a company and its customers. But it’s examples like this that helped CVector reach a new milestone, as it has now closed a $5 million seed round, Zhang and Ruggles told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The financing was led by Powerhouse Ventures and included a mix of venture and strategic backing, with participation from early-stage funds like Fusion Fund and Myriad Venture Partners, as well as Hitachi’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/hitachi-ventures-raises-400m-fund-to-invest-in-everything-from-fusion-to-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">corporate venture arm</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the funding round closed, CVector is talking a bit more about some of its first customers — and just how different they are. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “The joy of the last, say, six to eight months has been going to the industrial heartland, to all of these places that are just in the middle of nowhere, but have massive production plants that are either reinventing themselves or really transforming how they make decisions,” Zhang said in an interview.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of those customers is a metals processing company based in Iowa called ATEK Metal Technologies, which makes aluminum castings for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, among other things. CVector is doing things like helping spot potential problems that could lead to equipment downtime, monitor the whole plant’s energy efficiency, and keep an eye on commodity prices that impact raw material cost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That is, to me, such a good example where this is really skilled labor, and they will need all the help they can get from for us, from the software side, from technology side, to really help that group of people transform, take the business to the next level so they can keep growing,” Zhang said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finding optimizations in older plants might seem like the most obvious path for a company like CVector. But it has also picked up startups as customers, too, including Ammobia, a materials science startup based in San Francisco that is working to lower the cost of making ammonia. And yet the work CVector is doing for Ammobia is surprisingly similar to what it’s doing for ATEK, Zhang said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CVector is also growing. The company is up to 12 people, and it’s locked down its first physical office in the financial district in Manhattan. Zhang said he’s been attracting talent from the worlds of fintech and finance, especially hedge funds. The latter is ripe for recruiting, he said, since the people who work in the hedge fund industry are already pretty focused on using data to gain a financial edge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s the core of our sales pitch; it’s what we call ‘operational economics,’” Zhang said. “We position it to sit between the operation of the plant and the actual economics — the margin of how much you’re making money.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zhang still sees public utilities as a great place to apply CVector’s technology, though. (That’s where the valve example came from.) And he’s found that even these types of customers have become far more fluent in talking about the kinds of work CVector does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Tyler and I were just talking about how when we first started [the] company almost exactly a year ago, it was still like a taboo to talk about AI in general. There was a 50/50 chance if the customer would embrace AI or just kind of discredit you, right?” he said. “But now, over the especially last six months, everyone is asking for more AI-native solutions, even when sometimes the ROI calculation might not be clear. This kind of adoption craze is real.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ruggles said that’s in large part because what CVector does ultimately comes down to one thing: money. And with so much uncertainty in the world, managing costs has only gotten harder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re at this time when companies are really intimately worried about their supply chain and the costs and variability there, and being able to kind of layer AI on top [to make an] economic model of a facility, it’s really resonated with a lot of customers, whether it’s old and industrial in the heartland, or whether it’s new energy producers who are trying to do new and novel things,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Other noteworthy stats include over a 50% increase in returning users, over 40% rise in video played on average, and over 100% increase in posts created.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This surge was likely triggered by concerns over TikTok’s change in ownership and its unfortunately timed <a href=\"https://x.com/tiktokusdsjv/status/2015807214871535741?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">technical glitches</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok had <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/announcement-from-the-new-tiktok-usds-joint-venture-llc?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on January 22 the establishment of the TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, designed to comply with Trump’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/trump-signs-executive-order-approving-tiktok-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">executive order</a> requiring the company’s U.S. operations be sold to a group of American investors.

Now, however, some of TikTok’s users are more worried about the new American investors and their allegiance to Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those concerns grew to a head when TikTok pushed out an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-new-privacy-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">updated privacy policy</a>, which includes permission to track users’ GPS coordinates, among other things. Users also pointed to language in the privacy policy that said the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">app would track immigration status</a>. Although that language was not new, and its inclusion has to do with adherence to state privacy laws, some users began encouraging people to delete the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s unknown how many TikTok users actually followed through, what is clear is that some people sought out alternatives. Over the weekend, Skylight’s CEO, Tori White, said the app added around 20,000 new users and is continuing to grow. So far this January, the app has seen around 95,000 monthly active users.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">White credited the app’s more open and customizable nature as the force behind its growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Skylight has made notable gains, it’s still overshadowed by TikTok and its 200 million monthly active U.S. users. Still, Skylight’s founders believe their approach provides an opening for growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve seen what happens when one person dictates what’s pushed into people’s feeds,” White told TechCrunch. “Not only does it harm a creator’s connection with their followers, but the entire health of the platform. That’s why we built Skylight Social on open standards. We wanted creator and user power to be guaranteed by the technology. Not an empty promise, but an irrevocable right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In each case, the app will enable a logged-in instance of the service that’s accessible to Claude, enabling users to send Slack messages, generate charts, or access cloud files, depending on which apps have been enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Analyzing data, designing content, and managing projects all work better with a dedicated visual interface,” Anthropic said in a blog post announcing the feature. “Combined with Claude’s intelligence, you can work and iterate faster than either could offer alone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature is available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise subscribers, but not free users. Eligible users can activate the tools at <a href=\"http://claude.ai/directory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claude.ai/directory</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system is similar to OpenAI’s Apps system, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched in October</a> and enables interactive third-party tools. Both systems of app integrations are built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard introduced by Anthropic in 2024. MCP launched <a href=\"https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-21-mcp-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">support for apps in November</a>, drawing on work from both companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new apps will be particularly powerful when integrated with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropics-new-cowork-tool-offers-claude-code-without-the-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Claude Cowork</a>, an all-purpose agent tool launched by Anthropic last week. Built on top of Claude Code, Cowork lets users assign multistage tasks that draw on large and open-ended datasets — tasks that would have previously required terminal commands. Combined with the new apps feature, Cowork could be granted access to cloud files or ongoing work projects. For example, Cowork could update a marketing graphic in Figma or use new data from the company’s Box instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apps are not available in Cowork at launch, but Anthropic said the integration would be “coming soon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agentic systems can be unpredictable, and <a href=\"https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anthropic’s own safety documentation</a> for Cowork encourages users to monitor the agent closely and not grant any unnecessary permissions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records,” the company recommends. “Consider creating a dedicated working folder for Claude rather than granting broad access.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The third was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/obvious-ventures-closes-an-irrationally-sized-third-fund/\">$271,828,182</a> (which mathematicians and engineers instantly recognize as e, or Euler’s number), while the fourth fund, announced in mid-2022, continued the tradition as another palindrome at $355,111,553.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you haven’t guessed it by now, the meaning of Obvious Ventures’ newest fund size is a little less about geeky math and more about the firm’s investing philosophy. Twelve years into its journey, Obvious says the figure represents a full-circle perspective on its three broad focus areas: planetary health, human health, and economic health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We love the metaphor of taking a 360-degree view in each of those areas,” Joaquin said. “You have to be a student of the past to understand what’s worked and what hasn’t worked.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s working for the firm, according to Joaquin, is keeping its fund sizes small enough so that a single investment, if it becomes a durable public company, has the opportunity to return the entire fund. Joaquin likely placed an emphasis on durability in part because one of Obvious Ventures’ initial winners, Beyond Meat, reached a market capitalization of over <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/boom-bust-beyond-meat-struggles-stay-relevant-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$14 billion</a> shortly after its 2019 IPO, but had fallen to below a billion by <a href=\"https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:BYND/explorer/marketcap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">late 2022</a>.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Joaquin says the firm has seen meaningful cash distributions to limited partners from all of its core funds, and it boasts several companies with successful public-market exits. In 2015, Obvious Ventures invested in the satellite imagery company Planet Labs, which went public via a SPAC in 2021 and is currently valued at approximately $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, its Series A investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals maintains a market capitalization of over $2 billion.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obvious is also an early investor in the HR and payroll platform Gusto, which was most recently valued at more than <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/06/09/gusto-200-million-plus-tender-offer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$9 billion</a> in the private market and is widely considered to be on an IPO trajectory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a venture capital environment where only <a href=\"https://x.com/Beezer232/status/2014730309049164169\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">17% of firms</a> successfully raise more than three funds, per research from Sapphire Partners, Obvious Ventures’ latest fundraise solidifies the firm as an established VC player.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We made it to fund five, which is actually a big deal in the venture landscape,” Joaquin said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obvious Ventures may take a playful approach to fund sizes, but its focus on investing in startups that make a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/24/its-not-so-obvious-that-this-vc-firm-is-focused-on-impact/\">positive impact</a> on the world is serious. Joaquin pointed to several investments in each of the firm’s three pillars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the planetary health sector, the firm invested in Zanskar, a startup using proprietary data and AI to identify and harness geothermal energy, one of the most cost-effective power sources available. Just last week, Zanskar announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/zanskar-thinks-1-tw-of-geothermal-power-is-being-overlooked/\">$115 million</a> Series C. Obvious Ventures, which led the company’s previous round, is particularly excited about the investment. Joaquin noted that the geothermal power harnessed by Zanskar can help fuel energy-hungry AI data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its human health strategy, Obvious Ventures touted its investment in Inceptive, an AI platform for molecule development. Inceptive was founded by Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the primary authors of the seminal “Attention Is All You Need” paper, which introduced the transformer architecture, the breakthrough behind generative AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the area of economic health, Joaquin pointed to Dexterity Robotics. The company, which was valued at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/yet-another-ai-robotics-firm-lands-major-funding-as-dexterity-closes-latest-round/\">$1.65 billion</a> last year, builds humanoids to handle “dull, dirty, and dangerous” tasks currently performed by humans in warehouses and factories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to Joaquin, Obvious Ventures has four active investors, including co-founder Vishal Vasishth. (Ev Williams remains a co-founder and an adviser.) The firm intends to make approximately 10 investments annually, with check sizes ranging from $5 million to $12 million for seed and Series A startups.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For some users, the problems continue to persist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of these outages lines up with the long-awaited creation of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/heres-whats-you-should-know-about-the-us-tiktok-deal/\">separate U.S. TikTok entity</a> last week, which the U.S. government mandated due to concerns about the Chinese government potentially accessing user data via the app’s former parent company, ByteDance. (Now, ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new TikTok USDS Joint Venture, while managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX own 15% each.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the TikTok USDS Joint Venture stated in a <a href=\"https://x.com/tiktokusdsjv/status/2015807214871535741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2015807214871535741%7Ctwgr%5E2dc1cf92171256fc340be788c3196b4a78c8c746%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D3086046action%3Dedit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">post</a> on X that these issues were caused by a power outage at a U.S. data center.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,” the company <a href=\"https://x.com/tiktokusdsjv/status/2015807214871535741\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a>. “We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/status/tiktok/map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">user-reported data</a> from Downdetector, the outage is impacting users across the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok’s reasoning for the glitches is logical, given that more than one million people in the U.S. have been impacted by power outages after the massive storm. But some users are suspicious given how soon the outages occurred after the U.S. joint venture was formally established.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The outage also overlaps with ongoing protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2000-federal-agents-sent-to-minneapolis-area-to-carry-out-largest-immigration-operation-ever-ice-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">thousands</a> of ICE agents have been deployed since early January in what ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons called the “<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2026-01-07/dhs-deploys-2-000-officers-in-minnesota-to-carry-out-its-largest-immigration-operation-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">largest immigration operation ever</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Saturday, border patrol agents <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/minute-minute-timeline-fatal-shooting-alex-pretti-federal/story?id=129547199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shot and killed Alex Pretti</a>, marking ICE’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Ren%C3%A9e_Good\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">second murder</a> of a civilian in Minneapolis this month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the wake of the killing, some TikTok users said they had trouble searching on the app for information about the events in Minneapolis. The app malfunctions then led to panic about the possibility of government censorship. However, TikTok attributes these issues to its concurrent data center outage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People had also expressed concern over the weekend about TikTok’s updated privacy policy, which includes language that allows TikTok to collect data about users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.” However, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\">as TechCrunch reported</a>, some of these disclosures are not new and had appeared in TikTok’s privacy policy <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260121054327/https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prior</a> to the ownership deal’s close, primarily to comply with California’s Consumer Privacy Act.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the recent TikTok outages and privacy policy changes seem to be run-of-the-mill problems with bad timing, Americans do have reason to be cautious about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/eff-unions-sue-trump-administration-over-alleged-mass-social-media-surveillance-of-legal-residents/\">social media surveillance</a> — especially in times of political unrest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s cheaper, faster, and more independent from geopolitics.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That dual focus has helped 2150 raise a new €210 million second fund from a range of institutional investors and family funds, including Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, Church Pension Group, the Danish sovereign fund EIFO, Fund of Funds Carbon Equity, Novo Holdings, Islandbridge Capital, Security Trading Oy, and Viessmann Generations Group. The new fund brings the European firm’s assets under management to €500 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, the new fund has 34 limited partners, said Christian Hernandez, co-founder and partner at 2150. “Pretty meaty checks,” he added.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, 2150 has invested in seven companies from the new fund, including <a href=\"https://atmoszero.energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AtmosZero</a>, which makes industrial heat pumps; <a href=\"https://getmobil.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GetMobil</a>, an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/getmobil-raises-funding/\">e-waste recycling startup</a>; <a href=\"https://metycle.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Metycle</a>, a scrap and recyclable metals marketplace; and <a href=\"https://www.missionzero.tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MissionZero</a>, a direct air capture startup. Three others have yet to be announced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, 2150 is looking to invest in 20 companies in the second fund. Most startups it writes checks to will be raising Series A rounds, and the checks will total around €5 million to €6 million, Hernandez said. Half of the fund will be reserved for follow-on investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partners said they’ll be looking for a range of startups, similar to before. Specifically, though, they’re excited by opportunities in data centers and automation, both of which have been spurred by the recent surge in AI. But for them, AI is more than just an opportunity to invest in energy-related companies. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The impact there is more societal than it is climate-related,” Hernandez said. “Europe is expected to lose 100 million people between now and 2040 — just people getting older. The Netherlands already has 50% of their population over the age of 50. So what role does industrial automation help with helping those people be productive, but also generating GDP and funding those people’s pensions?” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bro said the focus on industrial applications was perhaps obvious in hindsight. “Cities are all supplied by large or small industries at the end of the day,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The focus appears to be paying off. 2150’s portfolio companies mitigated one megaton of carbon emissions last year, Hernandez said. “The fact that a small venture capital fund can already get to the megaton-level scale in only four years, that level of impact, along with the commercial traction, makes me feel like we’re doing the right thing.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Real-world attacks are often used in conjunction with digital surveillance tools like Pegasus, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/\">researchers have found</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The comic and activist said the attacks on his phone and the physical assault caused deep depression, ending his YouTube career.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saudi Arabia rebuffed Al-Masarir’s legal challenge, saying it had <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/biden-administration-says-saudi-crown-prince-immune-from-lawsuits-in-murder-of-khashoggi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">state immunity from prosecution</a>, a claim it had successfully argued in an earlier case in which the Saudi leader was accused of orchestrating the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the High Court rejected Saudi’s claim of immunity in Al-Masarir’s legal case, prompting the Kingdom to take no part in the litigation going forward, according to Reuters, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/saudi-dissident-awarded-41-million-by-uk-court-hacking-assault-by-saudi-arabia-2026-01-26/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported</a> the court ruling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is a compelling basis for concluding that [al-Masarir’s] iPhones were hacked by Pegasus spyware which resulted in the exfiltration of data from those mobile phones,” wrote Justice Pushpinder Saini <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26508222-al-masarir-v-ksa-london-high-court-ruling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in his ruling</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The judge said that the hacking was “directed or authorised” by the Saudi government or its agents. Justice Saini also found that the Saudi government was probably responsible for Al-Masarir’s assault.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if Saudi Arabia will pay Al-Masarir, or if the government plans to appeal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for NSO Group, which makes and sells access to the Pegasus spyware, did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

The operation has been marked by confrontations between federal agents and community members protesting the raids, with law enforcement indiscriminately deploying crowd-control tactics, including pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound cannons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This cannot continue, and we know the tech industry can make a difference,” the letter from tech industry workers continues. “When Trump <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-san-francisco-immigration-dd54f4e6d075eb6c723e5b881b96feb4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">threatened to send the National Guard</a> to San Francisco in October, tech industry leaders called the White House.

Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/billionaire-ceos-party-trump-melania-144257685.[%E2%80%A6]eeoEpLSHt2_eFkW_97VKcwdkZYDnYUo7HJDOnytFKTyM4L7ELgSmOgw943GWyW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple CEO Tim Cook</a>, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg all attended during President Trump’s inauguration and donated to the inauguration fund either personally or through their corporations.

Maia comes equipped with over 100 billion transistors, delivering over 10 petaflops in 4-bit precision and approximately 5 petaflops of 8-bit performance — a substantial increase over its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inference refers to the computing process of running a model, in contrast with the compute required to train it. As AI companies mature, inference costs have become an increasingly important part of their overall operating cost, leading to renewed interest in ways to optimize the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft is hoping that the Maia 200 can be part of that optimization, making AI businesses run with less disruption and lower power use. “In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,” the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s new chip is also part of a growing trend of tech giants turning to self-designed chips as a way to lessen their dependence on Nvidia, whose <a href=\"https://observer.com/2025/12/google-ai-chip-tpu-nvidia-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cutting-edge GPUs </a>have become increasingly pivotal to AI companies’ success. Google, for instance, has its TPU, the tensor processing units — which aren’t sold as chips but <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/07/googles-decade-long-bet-on-tpus-companys-secret-weapon-in-ai-race.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as compute power made accessible through its cloud</a>. Then there’s Amazon Trainium, the e-commerce giant’s own AI accelerator chip, which <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/amazons-custom-chips-pose-another-threat-to-nvidia-8aa19f5b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfRj9f6kiXIEVEI7trLmnZNL3IUzAQE5Lstsy-bO05Um44DpK0nrknU3c-XP1k%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6973d4fd&amp;gaa_sig=7ox5mp-GoK1ZnGNXTFKypquHIGRzwH0ZjYwuauc7G_nOSdYP9YWTywvH7xODgaRlnF2aFemAAcsCQ_zhbM4Upg%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">just launched its latest version</a>, the Trainium3, in December. In each case, the TPUs can be used to offload some of the compute that would otherwise be assigned to Nvidia GPUs, lessening the overall hardware cost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Maia, Microsoft is positioning itself to compete with those alternatives. In its press release Monday, the company noted that Maia delivers 3x the FP4 performance of third-generation Amazon Trainium chips, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft says that Maia is already hard at work fueling the company’s AI models from its Superintelligence team. It has also been supporting the operations of Copilot, its chatbot. As of Monday, the company said it has invited a variety of parties — including developers, academics, and frontier AI labs — to use its Maia 200 software development kit in their workloads.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s also the first version of the rocket that is meant to dock with other Starships in Earth orbit, a capability the company needs in order to reach the moon or Mars.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This all comes as SpaceX is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-elon-musk-is-racing-to-take-spacex-public-38f3de9b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfq0GfzojoJ-k3M7XZBNp__L48XVCpA0_sqJY4wLcZuGqsMGks9anL8I2wHfwM%3D&amp;gaa_ts=697780c0&amp;gaa_sig=pAYkhG2WVQzZ8OQxNyY9mDBVhWjsopXzG5vt-lfpYqRv0cdDx4LO9CQBP38AO1Oa4hZxqtvrHn_Domszvfpm3Q%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">racing toward an IPO later this year</a>, and under pressure from the Trump administration to return U.S. astronauts to the surface of the moon before the end of his second term. Starship, the most powerful rocket ever developed, is currently a key part of NASA’s mission to fulfill that goal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX was making progress toward a launch of Starship V3 in late 2025. But in November, the booster stage suffered an explosion during testing that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/spacexs-upgraded-starship-suffers-explosion-during-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blew out an entire side of the steel rocket</a>. The company said it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened, but has yet to offer a more detailed breakdown of what went wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been hoping to move on from the second version of Starship, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spacex-wraps-action-packed-starship-v2-era-as-program-moves-to-v3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was a mixed bag</a>. It was able to successfully reach orbit with Starship V2, deploy dummy versions of the next-generation Starlink satellites, and catch multiple booster stages after they returned to the launchpad. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Starship V2 also suffered a number of explosions and setbacks of its own. Some of those came as a result of SpaceX’s developmental approach, which involves pushing the test vehicles to — or past — their limit and then iterating based on what the company learns. Others were more unexpected, like when one of the Starship vehicles that sits atop the booster stage erupted in a massive fireball during <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/19/spacexs-starship-blows-up-ahead-of-10th-test-flight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ground testing last June</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has come to dominate the global launch market over the last decade, and it is relying on Starship to maintain that dominance. But competition is creeping in at the edges. Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin launched its first mega-rocket, known as New Glenn, for the first time in January 2025 and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/blue-origin-sticks-first-new-glenn-rocket-landing-and-launches-nasa-spacecraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">again in November</a>. The company launched its inaugural commercial payload for NASA on that second flight and also completed the first landing of its booster stage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blue Origin is planning a third launch of New Glenn <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/blue-origin-schedules-third-new-glenn-launch-for-late-february-but-not-to-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in late February</a> and hopes to send its own lunar lander to the moon sometime after that. While New Glenn is smaller than Starship, Blue Origin revealed late last year that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/blue-origin-reveals-a-super-heavy-variant-of-its-new-glenn-rocket-that-is-taller-than-a-saturn-v/\">it is developing a larger version</a> of the vehicle that more directly competes with SpaceX’s super-heavy rocket. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The upgraded Bluetooth chip, meanwhile, also helps extend the range at which items can be located. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, with this update, Precision Finding will be accessible from the Apple Watch Series 9 or later and Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=559\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085963\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=123,150 123w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=246,300 246w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,935 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=559,680 559w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=986,1200 986w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1051,1280 1051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=353,430 353w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=591,720 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=739,900 739w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=657,800 657w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1262,1536 1262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=549,668 549w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=308,375 308w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=507,617 507w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=436,531 436w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-AirTag-Find-My-Precision-Finding-01_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=41,50 41w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device’s speaker is also 50% louder than the prior generation, which means you can hear the AirTag’s beep from up to two times farther away than before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AirTag devices will also integrate with Share Item Location, an iOS feature that allows users to temporarily share the AirTag’s location with third parties.

The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/\">alleged that Apple was unfairly competing</a> as its finding network was instantly as big as the iPhone install base, and Apple was pushing AirTag rivals to integrate with its own Find My app. Other companies, like Chipolo, accepted Apple’s offer to work with Find My and competed against AirTag with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/14/chipolos-newest-airtag-competitor-works-with-both-apple-and-googles-finding-networks/\">products that work across iOS and Android</a>, or that have different features, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/chipolo-an-airtag-rival-debuts-rechargeable-trackers-with-a-six-month-battery-life/\">rechargeable batteries</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Apple’s AirTag remains the one to beat, with third-party estimates suggesting <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-airtags-dominate-smart-tag-market/\">that nearly 70%</a> of trackers sold in the latter part of 2024 were AirTag devices.
