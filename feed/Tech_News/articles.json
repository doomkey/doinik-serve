The first two MuSat XL spacecraft will deliver a 12-hour global revisit time and detect Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals at 30 times lower power than current capabilities, Hubble says. If those numbers pan out, it could materially extend battery life for tracking tags and sensors here on Earth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those two satellites will form the backbone of Hubble’s BLE Finding Network for enterprises in sectors ranging from logistics, infrastructure, and defense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hubble <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/hubble-network-connects-a-bluetooth-chip-to-a-satellite-for-the-first-time/\">made history in 2024</a> when it became the first company to establish a Bluetooth connection directly to a satellite. The startup’s proposition is compelling: instead of needing to buy specialized hardware, customers will only need to integrate their devices’ chipsets with a piece of firmware to enable connection to the Hubble network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits of the space-based network are massive, Hubble argues: it can provide visibility across the globe, including in remote areas, and offers a developer-friendly way to let companies track assets without building any additional infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company currently has seven spacecraft on orbit with a target of having 60 satellites in operation by 2028. The long-term goal is to upgrade the entire constellation to the larger platform buses because of their power and performance upgrades, Haro said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an aggressive schedule, but Haro added that one reason Hubble chose to partner with Muon is the latter’s ability to rapidly scale manufacturing to hit this goal, despite being a young company. (A recent <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.muonspace.com/press/muon-space-completes-146-million-series-b-to-scale-satellite-constellations-for-defense-and-commercial-missions\">$146 million funding round</a> should help.) Gregory Smirin, president of Muon Space, told TechCrunch that the company’s San Jose production facility is being built out to support production of over 500 spacecraft per year by 2027. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hubble is the first customer for the 500 kilogram-class MuSat XL satellite platform, which Muon says can provide multi-kilowatt power to payloads, optical crosslinks, high-volume downlink, and “near real-time” communications for time-sensitive missions. The partnership also signals a bigger push by the company to compete for more lucrative contracts with the Department of Defense. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The XL platform “is a perfect size and capability for SDA Tranche missions,” Smirin said, referring to the Space Development Agency’s initiative to build out a missile defense constellation in low Earth orbit. “XL reflects both the evolution of our technical stack and our growing role in delivering the kind of multi-mission spacecraft that programs like SDA increasingly rely on.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Muon’s business model can be thought of as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/muon-space-closes-56m-to-scale-all-in-one-satellite-platform/\">space-as-a-service</a>: the company designs, builds, and operates satellites using a vertically-integrated stack of hardware and software. The stack, called Halo, is meant to open up space access for companies with promising payloads but no interest in building the underlying satellite architecture. In practice, that means Hubble can focus on developing the BLE network while Muon handles the satellite platforms and mission operations. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new entity will support contract types, including agent of record, employer of record, and staff augmentation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upwork president and CEO Hayden Brown told TechCrunch that the timing was right to launch this new enterprise-focused business because Upwork’s existing enterprise customers have been increasingly asking for access to these talent pools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of the providers that exist today force their customers to choose between flexibility and compliance, or speed and scale, or having a digital tool versus having something that’s actually robust and for the enterprise,” Brown said. “And with this new capability, we’re refusing to compromise. We’re giving our customers all of the benefits they’ve been looking for, and we’ve heard loud and clear that they want this singular solution.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown said that Upwork’s existing enterprise business makes up about $100 million of the company’s overall $750 million in yearly revenue.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upwork decided to make the enterprise business a stand-alone entity because enterprises have very different needs regarding compliance and software integrations than the small and midsize businesses Upwork’s main business works with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Keeping them separate allows for better external branding and better internal focus, Brown said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upwork vetted more than 100 potential companies to acquire to build out this business, Brown said.

But Google on Wednesday denied that’s the case, at least in aggregate. Instead, the search giant says that total organic click volume from its search engine to websites has been “relatively stable” year-over-year and that average click quality has slightly increased.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This data is in contrast to third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic — often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the roll out of AI features in Search,” writes Google VP and Head of Search, Liz Reid, in <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-search-driving-more-queries-higher-quality-clicks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a new blog post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Google hasn’t shared any specific data to back up its conclusions, even if we assume Google’s claims to be true, this doesn’t necessarily mean that AI isn’t having an impact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even Google has to admit this, as Reid acknowledges that “user trends are shifting traffic to different sites, resulting in decreased traffic to some sites and increased traffic to others.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That word “some” is doing heavy lifting here, as Google doesn’t share data about how many sites are gaining or losing. And while chatbots like ChatGPT have certainly seen traffic increase in recent months, that doesn’t mean online publishers aren’t suffering.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3009660\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg 2224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1200,599 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1280,639 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=720,359 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=900,449 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=800,399 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1536,767 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=2048,1022 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=668,333 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1236,617 1236w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=708,353 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has been revamping its search engine for years to answer more questions directly on the search results page, and now does so with AI through its “AI Overviews” that appear at the top of search results. Google also allows users to interact with an AI chatbot for some queries. Yet Google denies that this is significantly reshaping the search landscape. Rather, it points to users shifting their attention to other sites to start their queries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reid explains, “People are increasingly seeking out and clicking on sites with forums, videos, podcasts, and posts where they can hear authentic voices and first-hand perspectives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reading between the lines, it seems like Google.com isn’t necessarily people’s first stop on the web these days. But that’s something we’ve known for some time. Back in 2022, a Google exec even said that social sites like TikTok and Instagram <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps/\">were eating into Google’s core products</a>, like Search and Maps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In our studies, something like almost 40% of young people, when they’re looking for a place for lunch, they don’t go to Google Maps or Search,” said Google SVP Prabhakar Raghavan, who ran the company’s Knowledge and Information organization at the time (he is now its chief technologist). “They go to TikTok or Instagram,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has also long been worried that Amazon.com had become people’s first stop for online shopping searches, and Reddit.com had become the first stop for researching topics of interest.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over many years, the company has tried to come up with compelling features for both consumers and retailers that would attract more users to Google Shopping. These efforts have included <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/google-introduces-shopping-actions-to-help-retailers-in-their-battle-with-amazon/\">universal shopping carts</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/google-lens-new-feature-makes-it-easier-to-shop-products-in-store/\">local inventory checks</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/01/google-search-new-shopping-features-get-better-deal/\">deal finders</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/google-adds-news-ways-to-shop-like-turning-a-websites-photos-into-shoppable-products/\">shopping from product images on websites</a>, and more. It even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/\">made its Shopping listings free</a> for merchants in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, as users <a href=\"https://dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">complained that Google Search quality was declining</a>, the search giant was seeing so much demand for Reddit that it finally <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/google-search-now-queries-reddit-and-quora-in-response-to-open-ended-questions/#!\">added a “Reddit” filter</a> to allow users to narrow down results on relevant search queries. (Now that filter simply reads “forums.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So perhaps there’s some truth in Google’s denials — it’s not AI that’s entirely responsible for killing search. Search was already dying. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"A person holding an iPhone and using Google AI Mode\" class=\"wp-image-3017226\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg 5196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Smith Collection/Gado / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s new blog post also attempts to move the goalposts a bit about what it means for websites receiving Google’s clicks. Now, instead of counting clicks, it wants publishers to think about click quality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says average click quality has increased, and Google is sending “slightly more quality clicks” to websites than a year ago. (Google explains that a quality click is one where users don’t quickly click back — they stay and read.) How much of an increase, though, Google doesn’t say. The company only points out that when people click through on an AI response to the source, they’re more likely to dive deeper, so those clicks are more valuable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, Google paints AI as an opportunity for web publishers to gain increased exposure, saying that “with AI Overviews, people are seeing more links on the page than before,” Reid writes. “More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/ai-referrals-to-top-websites-were-up-357-year-over-year-in-june-reaching-1-13b/\">while a growing referral source</a>, isn’t <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/chatgpt-referrals-to-news-sites-are-growing-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines/\">yet making up the difference</a> in terms of clicks, reports have shown. One recent study from Similarweb indicates that the number of news searches on the web resulting in zero clicks to news websites has grown from 56% (when Google launched AI Overviews in May 2024) to 69% as of May 2025. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3024257\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg 1912w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=300,254 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=768,650 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=680,575 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=1200,1015 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=1280,1083 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=430,364 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=720,609 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=900,762 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=800,677 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=1536,1300 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=668,565 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=443,375 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=729,617 729w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=627,531 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Similarweb</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google appears to knows this is a trend, too, as it recently launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/as-ai-kills-search-traffic-google-launches-offerwall-to-boost-publisher-revenue/\">a product for publishers</a> that helps them monetize their dwindling traffic in other ways that don’t rely only on advertising, like micropayments or newsletter sign-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that Google is pushing this <em>“</em>AI is not the end of search traffic!” PR now only makes the situation seem more dire.

Tea is advertised as a women’s safety app with more than 6 million users that is similar to “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/02/dating-same-guy-facebook-groups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Are we dating the same guy?</a>” Facebook networks. However, the app is controversial, since many of the claims that women post cannot be verified.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The backlash surrounding Tea escalated last week, after 404 Media reported 4chan users retaliated by <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/women-dating-safety-app-tea-breached-users-ids-posted-to-4chan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discovering a publicly exposed database</a> belonging to the app, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/dating-safety-app-tea-breached-exposing-72000-user-images/\">revealed</a> over 72,000 images, including thousands of selfies and photo IDs submitted for account verification. A <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/a-second-tea-breach-reveals-users-dms-about-abortions-and-cheating/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">subsequent hack</a> exposed more than 1 million private messages sent over the app, prompting the app to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/tea-apps-data-breach-gets-much-worse-exposing-over-a-million-private-messages/\">disable</a> its messaging feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TeaOnHer, which is now ranked No. 2 among Lifestyle apps on iOS, appears to be a direct rebuttal to the Tea app, even copying the language from Tea’s App Store description in its own listing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But like the app it sought to emulate, TeaOnHer contains security flaws of its own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has found at least one security flaw that allows anyone access to data belonging to TeaOnHer app users, including their usernames and associated email addresses, as well as driver’s licenses and selfies that users uploaded to TeaOnHer. Images of these driver’s licenses are publicly accessible web addresses, allowing anyone with the links to access them using their web browser.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In one case, TechCrunch saw a list of posts shared on TeaOnHer appended with each user’s email address, display name, and self-reported location.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch is withholding some of the details of the bugs so as to not help malicious actors access anyone’s data. The app’s maker did not respond to emails from TechCrunch asking who we can report the flaws to. As such, TechCrunch is publishing this report with limited details of the issue, given the app’s current popularity and the risk faced with using the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TeaOnHer was uploaded to the iOS App Store by a developer named Newville Media Corporation. According to LinkedIn, the founder and CEO of this company is Xavier Lampkin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch identified at least one TeaOnHer record associated with Lampkin’s own data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The security lapse will likely affect any user who signed up or shared identity documents with the app. The bug also exposes the number of users the TeaOnHer app has, which is about 53,000 users at the time of publication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch also identified a potential second security issue, in which an email address and plaintext password belonging to the app’s creator, Lampkin, was left exposed on the server. The credentials appear to grant access to the app’s “admin” panel. TechCrunch did not use the credentials, as doing so would be unlawful, but highlights the risks of inadvertently leaving admin credentials exposed to the web.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with its security flaws, the content portrayed within TeaOnHer is troubling in itself. While the app requests IDs and selfies from its users to verify their identities — a process that is not automatic — users can access a “guest” view of the app without signing in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Immediately upon opening “guest” view, TechCrunch saw several images of the same naked woman, posted under different names in a form of spam. It is not clear if this woman consented to this photo being shared. Other posts share the photos and names of women, alongside comments calling them “easy,” or accusing them of spreading sexually transmitted infections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across all free apps, TeaOnHer is ranked No. 17, higher than apps like Instagram, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify. Tea is currently ranked No. 2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Zoox had argued that it did and announced in July 2022 that it had self-certified; NHTSA balked. The agency opened an investigation in March 2023 to look into the matter, and specifically the process and data that Zoox had used to self-certify.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investigation didn’t slow Zoox’s development and testing of its autonomous vehicle technology. In early 2023, Zoox began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/13/zoox-robotaxis-start-slowly-rolling-out-on-california-public-roads/\">testing its custom-built robotaxis</a>, which don’t have a steering wheel or other traditional controls, on public roads near its Foster City, California headquarters. The company has since expanded its testing footprint to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/zoox-custom-robotaxis-are-finally-coming-to-san-francisco-and-las-vegas/\">Las Vegas and San Francisco</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox does not operate a commercial service yet. However, in San Francisco it has opened its robotaxis up to employees and hosted family and friends. Earlier this year, the company launched an Zoox Explorer program, aimed at early public riders, in Las Vegas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the exemption allows Zoox to demonstrate the robotaxis, not operate them commercially. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NHTSA’s announcement is connected to its <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-proposes-national-program-vehicles-automated-driving-systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new national framework</a>, which the agency argues will make it easier for companies to deploy autonomous vehicles without traditional manual driving controls — like steering wheels, pedals, and sideview mirrors — at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The framework, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/feds-clear-the-way-for-robotaxis-without-steering-wheel-and-pedals/\">known as AV STEP</a> (or ADS-Equipped Vehicle Safety, Transparency and Evaluation Program), allows NHTSA to green-light the sale and commercialization of autonomous vehicles that are not compliant with federal safety standards due to a lack of manual controls. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revised process involves an expedited application that allows companies like Zoox to receive exemptions for testing and demonstrations, and eventually, commercial operations. Zoox spokesperson Whitney Jencks said in an email that Zoox is working in close cooperation with NHTSA on this process, beginning with the demonstration exemption and followed by the commercial exemption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the agreement, NHTSA has closed its investigation into Zoox’s self-certification of its AVs. Zoox has agreed to remove or cover all statements that its purpose-built vehicles comply with applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Today, people can engage with AI via text and voice chat. Modern AI chatbots and AI-powered services can answer so many more questions, are imaginative, can reason, can create images and art, and generate videos, and with the agentic AI, they can even perform online tasks on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/amazon-unveils-a-new-and-improved-alexa-alexa/\">Amazon announced a complete makeover of its digital voice assistant</a> with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI. That service began rolling out slowly to customers in March and is now available to “many millions” of users, Amazon says. The system is also model-agnostic, meaning Alexa+ can use whatever she needs in the moment to answer the question or complete the task. Alexa+ is using models from Anthropic and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/amazon-announces-nova-a-new-family-of-multimodal-ai-models/\">Amazon Nova</a>, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company teased that this improved Alexa could do more than set timers and alarms, control smart home devices, and answer questions. She leverages generative AI to make sense of information stored in Amazon users’ accounts, understand their schedules, and their preferences. She can remember things, process files, and summarize a Ring camera’s footage.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034654\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Amazon says it’s been working with partners to allow it to take actions for people, like booking dinner reservations or Uber rides, or buying concert tickets. Integrations with Amazon’s own grocery service could also have it make shopping lists by speaking to it, and then have those products delivered. Essentially, it’s aiming to bring agentic AI into the home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But before we can get to that, let’s see how Alexa+ handles the basics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the first part of this series, I’m going to set up Alexa+, use the app, and ask the assistant some questions that only the new Alexa+ can do. Later, I’ll test the agentic AI features and smart home integrations.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-setting-up-alexa-on-an-echo-spot\">Setting up Alexa+ on an Echo Spot</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Device: Echo Spot<br>Default music service: Spotify (Premium)</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before moving to my new home, I put Alexa+ to the test on a brand-new Echo Spot after being accepted into the beta.

I have also slightly changed some of the dates, times, and numbers to further obscure any personal information that could be used to develop an understanding of my accounts, meetings, or household routines.</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-alexa-manage-the-family-s-schedule\">Can Alexa+ manage the family’s schedule?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Busy households, especially ones with kids, often use a family calendar to track activities, doctor’s appointments, errands, meetings, classes, and more. Our family calendar is maintained in Google Calendar, accessed on our phones through the native Google Calendar app, and on Mac desktops via the calendar app Fantastical.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon suggests that Alexa+ can help summarize your day, add new events to your calendar, identify conflicts, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, Alexa was fairly adept at letting me inquire about the schedule and various events, but she interrupted me when I was asking to add a new meeting to my calendar. I said, “Can you add a meeting to my calendar on August 6 at 2 p.m. with [entity] about—” Here she cut me off to ask, “What would you like to title this meeting?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Annoying, but not end-of-the-world terrible, I suppose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I was more easily able to ask things like “What’s on my calendar today?” and follow up to ask further questions — like if there were any meetings later in the week or to repeat one of the appointments. I didn’t have to say “Alexa” again to continue the conversation. It felt more natural, but there’s a very slight lag with her responses at times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(As an aside, when I went to find the history of my voice chats for writing this post, I asked Alexa where they could be found. She told me to look in the app’s Settings under the More menu, then look for Alexa Privacy or Review Voice History. She’s wrong. Neither option was there. I did, however, find my history from the “Recent Chats” link on the app’s home screen. Alexa, c’mon! Know thyself.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-alexa-remember-this\">Alexa, remember this</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another thing Alexa+ is supposed to be able to do is store information on your behalf. To test this out, I asked her to remember my frequent flier number. This interaction went poorly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Alexa, can you remember my Delta SkyMiles number?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: Sure, I’d be happy to remember your Delta SkyMiles number for you. What’s the number?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: *opens mouth to speak*</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: I’ve added that to Remember This in the Alexa privacy section of the app. Also, keep in mind that anyone who has access to any of your Alexa devices can use their voice to hear its contents.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Um, what? I tried again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Alexa, can you remember my SkyMiles number?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: Certainly! I’d be happy to remember your SkyMiles number for you. What’s the number? OK, saved it.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She didn’t even take a breath!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Curious, I asked her what she thinks the number is. She responded, “I don’t have your SkyMiles number saved yet. Would you like to tell me your number now?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Yes.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: OK, go ahead and tell me your Delta SkyMiles number.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: [says the eight-digit number]</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: OK, saved it.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: What’s my SkyMiles number?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: “Six hundred fifty-two million, four hundred eighty-six thousand…” </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Note: I changed the number for the purpose of this post, but yes, Alexa read it out like a long numeral instead of just saying 6-5-2-4-8-6, etc. Not helpful!)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-alexa-read-my-email\">Alexa, read my email</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa+ can now supposedly understand documents you upload in the Alexa app or forward to her at alexa@alexa.com using the email address associated with your Amazon account.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To try this, I forwarded an email from my child’s school. These come frequently and have a lot of useful information in them, but are often lost in the inbox. Perhaps if Alexa can handle this task, a new Gmail forwarding filter is in order?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Alexa, summarize the recent email from school.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: The recent email from [my child’s school] is a welcome-back letter for the 2025-2026 school year. It announces</em> <em>an “Early Start Day” orientation on August [date] for new students, with an information session for new parents that evening. Regular classes begin on August [date].</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Was there any information specifically for [grade] in that email?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: I don’t see any information specifically for [grade] in that email. The letter mainly covers general school information, orientation dates, and important deadlines for all students.</em></p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034659\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=768,577 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=680,511 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=1200,901 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=1280,961 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=720,541 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=900,676 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=800,601 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=668,502 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=499,375 499w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=822,617 822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Alexa app screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Great, that worked, it seems. But here’s where things got a little trickier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Are there any important dates I should add to my calendar?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: *repeats the important dates from above*</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Can you add those to my calendar for me?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: (Which must have misheard me?) Checking your calendar. Sarah, your calendar is looking busy. You have [activity] ongoing until August 16th, you have [activity]. On Thursday</em>—</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: (interrupting) I was asking if you could add the dates in the email to my calendar for me?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: Certainly, I’ll do that. (Pause) I’ve added the following dates to your calendar:</em></p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><em>Course Correction Request Period from August [date] through August [date]</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><em>New Student Orientation Early Start Day on August [date, time]</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><em>First Day of School on August [date]</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Is there anything else you’d like me to add?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this process seems efficient and is certainly helpful in a pinch, you’ll notice I left it up to Alexa to determine which dates were “important.” As a result, she picked the three dates closest to today. The email itself, however, contained a list of 12 important school dates, including things like Meet the Teacher Night, Open House, Midyear Graduation, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of them were formatted the same way in the email under the heading “Important Dates.” Had I only relied on Alexa and had not read the email itself, I would have missed these.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oh, dear.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-alexa-help-me-save-money\">Alexa, help me save money</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another Alexa+ promise is that she can help you track prices on Amazon so you can save money when things go on sale. All right, I’ll bite! I like online shopping.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> I decided to try tracking a couple of things, including one skin care item and a Coach handbag. These are things I definitely don’t need, but want — the kinds of things where a discount could prompt a purchase.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034660\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg 2158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=1200,683 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=1280,728 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=430,245 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=720,410 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=900,512 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=800,455 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=2048,1165 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=668,380 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=659,375 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=1084,617 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=708,403 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Amazon.com screenshot.</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Alexa, I want to know when the Glow Recipe Plum Plumping and Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Skin Care Serum goes on sale.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: Just a second … I’ve set up a deal tracker for the Glow Recipe Plum Plumping Serum.

The tool sort of functions like an AI tutor, as it’s designed to help users build a deep understanding instead of just getting answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch follows just over a week after OpenAI rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/openai-launches-study-mode-in-chatgpt/\">Study Mode for ChatGPT</a>, which is also designed to go beyond simply obtaining answers to questions by actually helping users develop critical thinking skills. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both companies’ launches <a href=\"https://harvardindependent.com/counterpoint-why-ai-should-not-be-used-in-the-classroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">come amid concerns</a> that AI chatbots <a href=\"https://www.psypost.org/study-finds-chatgpt-eases-students-cognitive-load-but-at-the-expense-of-critical-thinking/#google_vignette\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">undermine the learning process</a> because they spit out direct answers. The new tools from Google and OpenAI likely aim to address these concerns by positioning their chatbots as learning tools rather than simple answer engines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Guided Learning, Gemini will break down problems step-by-step and adapt explanations to its users’ needs. The feature responds using images, diagrams, videos, and interactive quizzes to help users build and test themselves on their knowledge, rather than simply giving them the answer.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png 2314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=1200,708 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=1280,756 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=430,254 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=720,425 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=900,531 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=800,472 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=1536,907 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=2048,1209 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=668,394 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=635,375 635w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=1045,617 1045w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=708,418 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-2.09.41PM.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says the feature will help users uncover the “why” and “how” behind concepts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Whether you’re preparing for an exam about enzymes, starting the first draft of a paper on the importance of bee populations in supporting our food systems, or exploring your passion for photography, Guided Learning is a collaborative thinking partner that helps you get it — each step of the way,” wrote Maureen Heymans, Google’s VP of Learning &amp; Sustainability, in the <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/guided-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the new feature, Google announced that it’s working to make Gemini as a whole better equipped to help users learn.

Jules’ paid tiers are part of the Google AI Pro and Ultra plans, which are priced at $19.99 and $124.99 a month, and offer subscribers 5× and 20× higher limits, respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Korevec noted that Jules’ packaging and pricing are based on “real usage” insights gathered over the past couple of months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The 60-task cap helped us study how developers use Jules and gave us the information we needed to design the new packaging,” she said. “The 15/day is designed to give people a sense of whether Jules will work for them on real project tasks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google also updated Jules’ privacy policy to be more explicit about how it trains AI. If a repository is public, its data may be used for training, but if it is private, Korevec said that no data is sent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We got a little bit of feedback from users that it [the privacy policy] wasn’t as clear as we thought it was, and so most of it is just responding to that. We didn’t change anything about what we’re doing on the training side, but we changed the language,” Korevec said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the beta, Google said that thousands of developers tackled tens of thousands of tasks, resulting in over 140,000 code improvements shared publicly. Initial feedback led the Google Labs team to add new capabilities, including reusing previous setups for faster task execution, integrating with GitHub issues, and supporting multimodal input.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034438\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg 1192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=430,239 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=720,400 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=900,500 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=800,444 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=668,371 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=1111,617 1111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=708,393 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-jules-open-pr-update.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1192px) 100vw, 1192px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jules / X</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two primary users of Jules so far are the AI enthusiasts and professional developers, Korevec said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By running asynchronously in a virtual machine, Jules stands apart from top AI coding tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Lovable, which all work synchronously and require users to watch the output after each prompt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Jules operates like an extra set of hands … you can basically kick off tasks to it, and then you could close your computer and walk away from it if you want and then come back hours later. Jules would have those tasks done for you, versus if you were doing that with a local agent or using a synchronous agent, you would be bound to that session,” Korevec explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, Jules received a deeper integration with GitHub to <a href=\"https://x.com/julesagent/status/1952446750167310456\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open pull requests automatically</a> — just like it could open branches — and a feature called <a href=\"https://x.com/julesagent/status/1952814314793910599\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Environment Snapshots</a> to save dependencies and install scripts as a snapshot for faster, more consistent task execution.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-vibe-coding-to-mobile-use-beta-trials-informed-jules-development\">From vibe coding to mobile use, beta trials informed Jules’ development</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since entering public beta, Jules has logged 2.28 million visits worldwide, 45% of them from mobile devices, per data from market intelligence provider <a href=\"http://similarweb.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SimilarWeb</a>, reviewed by TechCrunch. India was the top market for traffic, followed by the U.S. and Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google did not share specifics on Jules’ user base and its top geographies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Korevec told TechCrunch that during the beta, the team observed that many people used Jules from traditional vibe-coding tools to either fix bugs that might have been implemented or extend the vibe-coded project to make it more production-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Originally, Jules required users to have an existing codebase. But Google soon realized many potential users — like those trying other AI tools — might want to explore it without one. Korevec said the company quickly enabled Jules to work even with an empty repository. That helped increase its scope and usage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google Labs’ team also noticed an increasing number of users accessing Jules through their mobile devices. Although the tool does not have a dedicated mobile app, Korevec said users were accessing it through its web app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Since it’s a big use case that we’re seeing emerging, we’re absolutely exploring what the features are that people need on mobile a lot more,” she noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside beta testers, Korevec stated that Google already uses Jules to help develop some projects internally, and there is now a “big push” to use the tool on “a lot more projects” at the company. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The idea came to founder Mitchell Jones after he left his earlier Y Combinator-backed fintech startup, Lendtable, as he began to experiment with AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He saw the potential to build out a system that would make using AI and agent payments simpler and more developer-friendly. While experimenting with an AI app and trying to build what he thought was something simple, he realized he quickly spent more than $400 trying to build a basic form-filling agent.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I kept running into the same issue,” he told TechCrunch. “I was using the same underlying models and tools again and again, but through different wrappers or platforms.” And each time, he had to start a new subscription, re-authenticate, and pay separately, “even though I was already paying for access to the core model.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That felt fundamentally broken,” he continued. “I didn’t want to keep rebuying access to the same thing under a different wrapper. What I wanted was a single wallet, one set of credits, and the ability to move between tools and providers without starting over every time so I could pay for what I was using.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He decided to launch Lava Payments as a solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lava is a digital wallet that lets merchants use usage credits to facilitate transactions. <br><br>The idea is that one set of credits working across merchants and services makes it easier for autonomous agents to make payments without needing human intervention. It works like this: A merchant can enable the Lava wallet for their customers to use and upload (credits) money to. Once a customer does that, they can take that money and use it at any merchant that also accepts Lava and any of the foundational models, like GPT and Claude, on a “pay as you go basis,” Jones said. <br><br>So, rather than having to pay for each tool, a user buys a one-time usage credit that AI agents can simply charge as they perform various tasks. No more asking the user to approve transaction after transaction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Without Lava, agents can’t move smoothly through the internet because they constantly get blocked when it comes time to pay,” he said. He used Google as an example, saying every time a person opens Google Maps, they don’t have to pay Google for that map, as they’ve already paid Verizon and AT&amp;T to access the internet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, the startup announced a $5.8 million seed round led by Lerer Hippeau. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in this space include startups like <a href=\"https://metronome.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Metronome. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We see the world as very interconnected,” Jones said about what makes his product different. “What we’re really focused on is building [for the] agent-native economy.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Born to a working family in Dayton, Ohio, Jones said his parents always told him the best way to get ahead was to work hard, save money, and get a good education.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You know, a lot of the things that most people are told,” he recalled, when speaking with TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jones took that advice to heart.

In the screenshot below, you can see the archived version of the site on the Wayback Machine on the left, and the current site on the right — the text highlighted in yellow has been removed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These sections largely relate to the powers that Congress has and does not have, as well as limitations on the powers of individual states. The removal includes sections relating to habeas corpus, the powers that protect citizens from unlawful detention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the sections’ text appears to be missing, as indicated by a trailing semicolon at the end of Section 8, where text used to follow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://x.com/librarycongress/status/1953109733633597634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a tweet posted</a> on Wednesday, the Library of Congress said the sections were missing “due to a coding error” and expect it to be “resolved soon.” When contacted by TechCrunch, a spokesperson for the Library of Congress did not say what caused the coding error, or how it was introduced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Changing the U.S. Constitution’s text on the website does not change or have any effect on U.S. law, but it nevertheless follows senior Trump administration official Stephen Miller’s threats earlier this year to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/top-white-house-adviser-stephen-miller-says-actively-looking-suspendin-rcna205942\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suspend habeas corpus</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle declined to comment beyond the Library of Congress’ post.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg\" alt=\"a screenshot showing a diff between the US constitution a few weeks ago, and the yellow chunk of text that has since been removed.\" class=\"wp-image-3034620\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg 2361w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=768,588 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=680,521 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=1200,919 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=1280,981 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=430,329 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=720,552 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=900,690 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=800,613 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=1536,1177 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=2048,1569 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=668,512 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=489,375 489w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=805,617 805w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=693,531 693w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/habeas-corpus-removal-constitution.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2361px) 100vw, 2361px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Large sections of the U.S. Constitution were removed from the U.S. government’s official page</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated with more details from the Library of Congress, and with a response from the White House.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies across many industries are implementing AI agents for internal use, automating a wide range of tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the financial sector, AI agents are critical for fraud detection. They can analyze vast amounts of transaction data in real time. Meanwhile, sales organizations are using AI agents to gather data on potential customers. These AI sales agents can scour the web and social media for information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be effective, these agents need to access the internet and find information from relevant sources, all while following company policies and mirroring how a human researcher would work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Connecting an agent directly to a large language model like ChatGPT without company-specific safeguards can lead to highly inappropriate results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Governance, risk, and compliance at the enterprise is so important now, and if you just let that happen, it’s just going to be the wild, wild west,” George Mathew, managing director at Insight Partners, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Insight Partners led a $20 million Series A in <a href=\"https://www.tavily.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tavily</a>, a startup that connects AI agents to the web in a way that’s compliant with company-specific policies. The investment brings the 1-year-old Tavily’s total funding to $25 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded last year by data scientist Rotem Weiss, Tavily began as an open source project he created in 2023 called GPT Researcher. The consumer-focused project fetched real-time web data before ChatGPT was hooked up to the internet, Weiss told TechCrunch. “It went extremely viral, so pretty fast we gained almost 20,000 GitHub stars.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weiss launched Tavily after ChatGPT and other LLMs introduced web search. Unlike GPT Researcher, Tavily focuses on enterprise clients. It provides a suite of tools to companies like Groq, Cohere, MongoDB, and Writer, allowing their agents to search, crawl, and extract structured insights from both public and private sources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While most AI agents aren’t yet connected to the internet, Weiss says Tavily’s goal is to onboard the next billion agents to the web.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tavily is not the only startup providing search tools for AI agents. It competes with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/exa-raises-17m-lightspeed-nvidia-ycombinator-google-ai-models/\">Exa</a>, which raised a $17 million Series A from Lightspeed, Nvidia, and Y Combinator last year. Another smaller startup that offers a web search connectivity layer is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/a-job-ad-for-y-combinator-startup-firecrawl-seeks-to-hire-an-ai-agent-for-15k-a-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Firecrawl</a>. OpenAI and Perplexity are also offering search solutions that are geared toward independent developers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

More recently, however, politics has fully entered the world of cybersecurity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, President Donald Trump <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/trump-orders-federal-investigation-into-former-cisa-director-chris-krebs/\">ordered an investigation into former CISA director Chris Krebs</a>, who had publicly rebuffed Trump’s false claims about election fraud by declaring the 2020 election secure. Trump later <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trump-fires-us-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs-for-debunking-false-election-claims/\">fired Krebs by tweet</a>. The investigation ordered by Trump months after his 2024 reelection forced Krebs to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/former-cisa-director-chris-krebs-vows-to-fight-back-against-trump-ordered-federal-investigation/\">step down from SentinelOne and vow to fight back</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, Jen Easterly, another former CISA director and Krebs’ successor, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-we-really-securing-jen-easterly-auyae/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called on the cybersecurity community to get involved</a> and speak out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If we stay silent when experienced, mission-driven leaders are sidelined or sanctioned, we risk something greater than discomfort; we risk diminishing the very institutions we are here to protect,” Easterly wrote in a post on LinkedIn. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Easterly was herself <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/jen-easterly-west-point-mcdermott-chair-laura-loomer-dan-driscoll-army/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a victim of political pressure</a> from the Trump administration when her offer to join West Point was rescinded in late July. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deibert, who this year <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://chasingshadowsbook.ca/\">published his new book</a>, “Chasing Shadows: Cyber Espionage, Subversion, and the Global Fight for Democracy,” is echoing the same message as Easterly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that there comes a point at which you have to recognize that the landscape is changing around you, and the security problems you set out for yourselves are maybe trivial in light of the broader context and the insecurities that are being propelled forward in the absence of proper checks and balances and oversight, which are deteriorating,” said Deibert.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deibert is also concerned that big companies like Meta, Google, and Apple could take a step back in their efforts to fight against government spyware — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#spyware-commercial-government\">sometimes referred</a> to as “commercial” or “mercenary” spyware — by gutting their threat intelligence teams. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These threat intelligence teams are dedicated groups of security researchers that track government hackers, both those working inside government agencies, such as China’s Ministry of State Security or Russia’s intelligence agencies FSB and GRU, and companies such as NSO Group or Paragon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These are the same teams that are responsible for detecting hacks against their own users, such as when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/30/eight-things-we-learned-from-whatsapp-vs-nso-group-spyware-lawsuit/\">WhatsApp caught NSO Group</a> hacking more than 1,400 of its users in 2019, or when Apple caught hackers using government spyware to target its customers and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/\">notified</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/apple-alerted-iranians-to-iphone-spyware-attacks-say-researchers/\">the</a> <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/apple-alerts-iphone-users-in-98-countries-to-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">victims</a> of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/why-apple-sends-spyware-victims-to-this-nonprofit-security-lab/\">attacks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deibert believes there is a “huge market failure when it comes to cybersecurity for global civil society,” a part of the population that generally cannot afford to get help from big security companies that typically serve governments and corporate clients. “This market failure is going to get more acute as supporting institutions evaporate and attacks on civil society amplify,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Whatever they can do to contribute to offset this market failure (e.g., pro bono work) will be essential to the future of liberal democracy worldwide,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deibert is concerned that these threat intelligence teams could be cut or at least reduced, given that the same companies have cut their moderation and safety teams. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He told TechCrunch that threat intelligence teams, like the ones at Meta, are doing “amazing work,” in part by staying siloed and separate from the commercial arms of their wider organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But the question is how long will that last?” said Deibert.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, unlike Apple’s Find My and Snap Map, which let you share your location with others indefinitely, Instagram only lets users do so for up to one hour. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034355\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png 2120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Instagram</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instagram says the new map feature will make it easier for friends to coordinate and link up for hangouts. It also lets users explore location-based content that their friends and favorite creators have shared or engaged with. For example, if your friend attends a nearby music festival and posts a story while there, it will appear on the map. Similarly, if a creator posts a reel about a new restaurant in your city, you’ll be able to discover it on Instagram Map.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regardless of whether you choose to share your location, you can use the map to explore location-based content, Instagram says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The map also allows users to leave short messages, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/instagram-now-supports-text-updates-with-launch-of-notes-adds-other-new-sharing-features/\">“Notes,”</a> on the map for others to see. Instagram Notes are currently the short messages that appear at the top of your direct messaging feed, but with the launch of Instagram Map, users can now post these short updates on the map.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Instagram is certainly taking on Snapchat with this new feature, it also has the opportunity to appeal to people who were fans of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/zenly-is-still-hugely-popular-so-whys-snap-shutting-it-down/\">Zenly</a>, a social map app that Snap acquired and then shut down in 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new map feature is launching in the United States starting Wednesday, with broader global availability coming soon.

These reposts may show up in their friends’ feeds and will also be displayed in a new “Reposts” tab on their profile. Instagram says the new feature gives users a way to share their interests with others and also offers creators the opportunity to reach a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To repost a reel or post, users tap the repost icon. Users can also choose to add a note to the repost by typing into the thought bubble that appears on screen and pressing save.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regarding the new “Friends” tab in Reels, Instagram launched it in the United States earlier this year and is now making it available globally. The tab lets you see public reels that your friends have liked, commented on, reposted, and created.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For users who want to browse and interact with content privately, Instagram is rolling out the ability to opt out of having content you’ve engaged with shown in the friends tab. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can hide their likes, comments, and reposts from the tab. Additionally, they can choose to mute likes, comments, and reposts from specific people they follow.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During Match’s second-quarter earnings call, Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff said that Tinder will debut a new feature called “modes,” which will allow users to switch between different dating goals to explore new connections in real time. This is similar to a previous option where Tinder allowed users to put their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/14/tinder-launches-relationship-goals-feature/\">relationship goals directly on their profiles</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder will also explore a broader redesign and other new features, including those aimed at college students, to drive more usage among Gen Z. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another new feature allows users to like specific parts of a profile, nudging people to start conversations based on those likes, similar to Match’s dating app Hinge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes arrive amid a mixed quarter for the dating app giant, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-05/match-plans-50-million-product-investment-after-upbeat-forecast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> flat year-over-year revenue of $864 million and earnings that declined from $133.3 million year-over-year to $122.5 million in Q2. However, the company provided a better-than-expected Q3 outlook with revenue reaching $910-920 million, which boosted its stock post-earnings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Match also announced it would invest $50 million in product development, as the dating app maker aims to connect with younger Gen Z users and use AI to improve its products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ll take the first steps towards a new UI refresh in Q3 with a cleaner, faster, and more modern look across the entire app,” Rascoff said. “We’re on track to test version one of a redesigned ‘see who likes you’ tab this fall with the goal of helping users connect with people they’re more likely to be interested in, as well as to drive more revenue,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of the latter, Tinder continues to experiment with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/tinder-will-try-ai-powered-matching-as-the-dating-app-continues-to-lose-users/\">AI-powered matching</a>, which it debuted in New Zealand earlier this year. The feature delivers curated matches based on information from your Tinder profile, answers to questions, and, optionally, insights from the user’s camera roll photos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company intends to roll out this feature to more geographies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The interactive matching experience we’ve been testing in New Zealand is specifically designed to appeal to this type of audience [users under 30]: Somebody who doesn’t just want to be judged based on their physical appearance. [The feature is for] somebody who instead is willing to put in a little bit of time, answer some questions, and then get a custom result back,” Rascoff said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, Rascoff noted that Tinder is thinking about launching more college-specific features, including allowing users to just search within their college or other selected colleges, to appeal to younger users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also offered an update on Tinder’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/you-can-now-arrange-a-double-date-with-friends-on-tinder/\">Double Date option</a>, launched in June, that lets users pair up with a friend to match with another couple. The dating company said it saw positive results with 92% of users utilizing the feature being under 30.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3019017\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tinder</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was Rascoff’s first full quarter at the helm of Match Group, as the Zillow Group co-founder and Match board member was <a href=\"https://ir.mtch.com/investor-relations/news-events/news-events/news-details/2025/Spencer-Rascoff-Appointed-Match-Group-Chief-Executive-Officer/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">appointed</a> CEO in February.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, the company announced that Faye Iosotaluno would step down from the app’s CEO position in July, with Rascoff taking on the role.

Large enterprises with trade secrets, companies in highly regulated industries, and government agencies have thought more than twice about bringing in AI tools out of concern that their — or worse, their customers’ — data could inadvertently be compromised, or used to train foundation models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canadian AI firm Cohere is aiming to alleviate those concerns with its new AI agent platform dubbed North, which promises to enable private deployment so that enterprises and governments can keep their and their customers’ data safe behind their own firewalls. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“LLMs are only as good as the data they have access to,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/15/cohere-co-founder-nick-frossts-indie-band-good-kid-is-almost-as-successful-as-his-ai-company/\">Nick Frosst</a>, co-founder of Cohere, said during a demo of North. “If we want LLMs to be as useful as possible, they have to access that useful data, and that means they need to be deployed in [the customer’s] environment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of using enterprise cloud platforms like Azure or AWS, Cohere says it can install North on an organization’s private infrastructure so that it never sees or interacts with a customer’s data. North can run on an organization’s on-premise infrastructure, hybrid clouds, VPCs, or air-gapped environments, Frosst said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can deploy literally on a GPU in a closet that they might have somewhere,” he explained, adding that North was designed to run on as few as two GPUs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cohere claims North also includes security protocols like granular access control, agent autonomy policies, continuous red-teaming, and third-party security tests. And it meets international compliance standards like GDPR, SOC-2, and ISO 27001.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-than-private-deployments\">More than private deployments</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034577\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png 1776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=1200,743 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=1280,793 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=430,266 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=720,446 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=900,557 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=800,495 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=1536,951 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=668,414 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=605,375 605w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=996,617 996w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=708,439 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Cohere</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cohere, which has so far <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/22/cohere-raises-500m-to-beat-back-generative-ai-rivals/\">raised</a> $970 million, most recently at a $5.5 billion valuation, said it has already piloted North with some customers such as RBC, Dell, LG, Ensemble Health Partners, and, as TechCrunch reported last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/cohere-is-quietly-working-with-palantir-to-deploy-its-ai-models/\">Palantir</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">North mirrors many AI agent platforms right out of the box. Its chief features are chat and search, which let users get answers to customer support inquiries; summarize meeting transcripts, write marketing copy, and access information from both internal resources and the web. Frosst added that all responses include citations and “reasoning” chains of thought so employees can audit and verify the output.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The chat and search functions are powered by existing Cohere technology, like Command (its family of generative AI models) and Compass (its multimodal search tech stack). Frosst said North is powered by a variant of its Command model that is trained for enterprise reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It goes beyond just Q&amp;A and gets into doing work for you. So, [North] has a bunch of asset creation. It can make tables, it can make documents, it can make slideshows. It can do a bunch of market research,” Frosst said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that in May, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/ai-startup-cohere-acquires-ottogrid-a-platform-for-conducting-market-research/\">Cohere acquired Ottogrid</a>, a Vancouver-based platform that develops enterprise tools for automating high-level market research. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other AI agent platforms, North can connect to existing workplace tools like Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, Outlook, and Linear, and integrate with any Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to access industry-specific or in-house applications. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As you build confidence by chatting to the model, there’s like a smooth transition that happens between using this as an augmentation to using it as an automation,” Frosst said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Frosst’s title.
