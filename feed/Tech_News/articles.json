In March, the AI cloud infrastructure provider went public in one of the biggest and most anticipated IPOs of the year that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/coreweave-co-founder-explains-how-a-closet-of-crypto-mining-gpus-led-to-a-1-5b-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">didn’t live up to its hype.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another setback took place in October, when a planned acquisition of the cloud provider’s business partner, Core Scientific, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/ai-mania-tanks-coreweaves-core-scientific-acquisition-it-buys-python-notebook-marimo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">faltered</a> due to skepticism from the acquisition target’s shareholders. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, the firm has acquired a number of different companies, its stock has <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-months-coreweave-ipo-fizzled-202659856.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gone up</a> and <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/coreweave-stock-price-convertible-bond-debt-b80cb3b9?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf_GTbKaBDutljK6HnVGrUi329TIw6rbvk2FzbBV9S7QZHLlLzT1GGq0bjuUIs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69388c93&amp;gaa_sig=rhfwcBxjtr5ICwdZwg4-63kU5phSDvciX7w__XEOECGnUL8MwQnFDouc0SStN0TXcWdGIZ-WrYvwkDEVaUnQXQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">down</a>, and it’s been both <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91457190/coreweave-ai-boom-cloud-nvidia-openai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">criticized</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/coreweave-earnings-debt-ai-infrastructure-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lauded</a> for its role in the booming AI data center market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an interview at the Fortune Brainstorm AI summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, CoreWeave’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Intrator, defended his company’s performance from critics, noting that it was in the midst of creating a “new business model” for how cloud computing can be built and run. Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/tariff-turmoil-may-have-killed-the-tech-ma-markets-comeback/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">President Trump’s tariffs went into effect</a> — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90. Its more wary critics <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/coreweave-and-palantir-get-meme-stock-comparisons-as-shares-soar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have compared it</a> to a meme stock due to its penchant for going up and down. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the uncertainty around CoreWeave’s stock <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/coreweave-stock-price-convertible-bond-debt-b80cb3b9?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf_GTbKaBDutljK6HnVGrUi329TIw6rbvk2FzbBV9S7QZHLlLzT1GGq0bjuUIs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69388c93&amp;gaa_sig=rhfwcBxjtr5ICwdZwg4-63kU5phSDvciX7w__XEOECGnUL8MwQnFDouc0SStN0TXcWdGIZ-WrYvwkDEVaUnQXQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has been credited</a> to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/822011/coreweave-debt-data-center-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hefty level of debt</a>. Not long after CoreWeave announced a deal on Monday to issue even more debt to finance its data center buildout, its stock <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91457190/coreweave-ai-boom-cloud-nvidia-openai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped some 8%</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intrator seems to see his company as a disruptor, one whose unconventional tactics may take some getting used to. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” he said during his appearance Tuesday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CoreWeave actually started its corporate life <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/coreweave-scrappy-cryptominer-multibillion-dollar-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as a crypto miner</a> but in short order built itself into a pivotal provider of “AI infrastructure” to some of the tech industry’s most major players. In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/openais-investment-into-thrive-holdings-is-its-latest-circular-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“Circular” business deals</a>, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-24b-ai-deal-blitz-has-wall-street-asking-questions-about-murky-circular-investments-110039309.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised questions</a> about the industry’s long-term economic stability. Perhaps not surprisingly, since <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-quietly-buys-more-stock-210300633.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nvidia is one of its investors</a> and its supplier of GPUs, Intrator swatted away such concerns. “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand,” he said. “You do that by working together.”<br> <br>Since the IPO, CoreWeave has continued to make efforts to expand its business. After it acquired <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/coreweave-acquires-ai-developer-platform-weights-biases/\">Weights &amp; Biases</a>, an AI developer platform, in March, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/03/coreweave-acquires-agent-training-startup-openpipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it went on to acquire OpenPipe</a>, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning. In October, it also made deals to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/ai-mania-tanks-coreweaves-core-scientific-acquisition-it-buys-python-notebook-marimo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquire Marimo </a>(the creator of an open source notebook) and <a href=\"https://www.coreweave.com/news/coreweave-to-acquire-monolith-expanding-ai-cloud-platform-into-industrial-innovation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Monolith</a>, another AI company. It also recently announced an expansion of its cloud <a href=\"https://www.coreweave.com/news/coreweave-expands-agreement-with-openai-by-up-to-6-5b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnership with OpenAI</a> and said it has plans to <a href=\"https://www.coreweave.com/news/coreweave-to-enter-the-u-s-federal-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">move into the federal market</a>, where it wants to provide cloud infrastructure to U.S. government agencies and the defense industrial base. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

McLeod and a dedicated team spent the year developing the idea of Overtone, which is described as “an early-stage dating service focused on using AI and voice tools to help people connect in a more thoughtful and personal way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McLeod isn’t the only dating app founder branching out into new, standalone AI experiences. Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder of Bumble, said <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/whitney-wolfe-herd-bumble-ai-398779bb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqc3E-3I0kZ72C6FwfqTXZQvZyOcbRCcFG-2BdgEj6XABPWVHeHW9YBA5_DT694%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6938aec1&amp;gaa_sig=yl0lflEClnun-lBXM5aEoEyont1rb5SqaGGQbzeYfqU5nMOWX1dcDJ0fKM4jB6OcYlBozDfavdnL_zzDiOh6JA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">she wants to use AI</a> to make “the world’s smartest and most emotionally intelligent matchmaker in existence.” Somewhat infamously, Wolfe Herd <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/ai-personas-are-future-dating-bumble-founder-says-many-arent-buying-rcna151738\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">proposed</a> the idea last year of singles using AI to stand-in for themselves and date other people’s AIs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not yet clear how Overtone will differentiate itself from other dating apps, which have been experimenting with AI features to compensate for the market’s growing malaise with online dating — especially among <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91443225/gen-z-is-ghosting-dating-apps-could-ai-win-them-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gen Z</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder has reported nine straight quarters of paying-subscriber declines and has leaned into AI with features that are supposed to help users get more matches. Hinge launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/hinges-new-ai-feature-helps-daters-start-better-convos-moving-beyond-boring-small-talk/\">another AI feature</a> just this week called “Convo Starters,” which is supposed to help daters come up with more interesting things to say than the usual small talk. Tinder and Facebook Dating have each experimented with AI-powered matching to combat “swipe fatigue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ceding control of your dating experience is one thing, but other attempts at integrating AI into these apps get even more dubious. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Match CEO Spencer Rascoff said last month that a “major pillar of Tinder’s upcoming 2026 product experience” will be a feature called Chemistry. With the user’s permission, the feature will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/tinder-to-use-ai-to-get-to-know-users-tap-into-their-camera-roll-photos/\">access users’ camera rolls</a> to learn more about them. (For the record, we would advise that you do not give tech companies unfettered access to even more of your data.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McLeod founded Hinge in 2011 as a dating app with a greater focus on building relationships than facilitating casual dates. The app, which is on track to hit $1 billion in revenue by 2027, was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/match-fully-acquires-relationship-focused-app-hinge/\">acquired</a> by Match in 2019. Jackie Jantos, Hinge’s president and chief marketing officer, will take over as CEO. McLeod will remain in an advisory position at Hinge through March.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This summer, TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/hinge-cmo-jackie-jantos-hopes-to-help-make-gen-zers-less-lonely/\">spoke to Jantos</a> at SXSW London about how Hinge will address Gen Z, a market that’s growing <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/06/dating-apps-doomed-former-hinge-leader-says-gen-z-meet-in-person/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">increasingly disillusioned</a> with meeting people online.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a generation that has grown up with a deep understanding of how digital experiences are created and what they are trying to get out of them,” Jantos told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gen Z wants transparency and authenticity from digital brands, according to Jantos. While some might see this as inherently incompatible with the company’s growing reliance on AI, Hinge’s AI recommendation feature, launched in March, drove a <a href=\"https://ir.mtch.com/investor-relations/news-events/news-events/news-details/2025/Match-Group-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">15% increase</a> in matches and contact exchanges in the first quarter of this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on Jantos’ comments upon assuming her new role, it seems that Hinge will continue investing in these features under her leadership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our focus will remain on intentional innovation that is grounded in culture, creativity, and a deep understanding of how people connect today,” Jantos said in a statement.<br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The original idea for Cashew was sparked by an issue she ran into frequently: Clients wanted full research projects — with real-world data from humans — done within a few days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, shortening that timeline while still producing the same quality of research results wasn’t possible, Graves said, because the technology to speed up the process wasn’t ready yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That was definitely the aha moment,” Graves said. “And it wasn’t until the onset of AI that we were actually able to automate these processes that we use as researchers, best practices, these data science-backed methodologies, as well as the formatting of reports that we know that everybody wants.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bringing automation to the process also brings the cost down, which makes Cashew an option for small and medium-size brands that wouldn’t have been able to afford to work with a traditional market research firm, Graves added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves founded Cashew in 2023 alongside Rose Wong, chief operating officer, with an initial focus on consumer packaged goods, specifically food and beverage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves said she thinks Cashew can stand out in the increasingly crowded AI marketing tools category because it isn’t fully automated. Each Cashew client gets fresh human data with each project, which requires market research expertise, Graves said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cashew’s competitive advantage may only grow as the company matures. The company takes all of the real-world data it collects from its clients’ projects, anonymizes it, and puts it in a database, which can help add additional proprietary data to future research projects, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised C$1.5 million in pre-seed funding and is gearing up to launch its seed round in early 2026 with the hope of raising up to $5 million, Graves said. That capital will be put toward continuing to develop the product’s tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves said the company’s two main areas of focus heading into next year are increasing the company’s presence in the U.S. and also working to build up its B2B business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The people who are already buying research, that’s already a massive category, but that doesn’t even include all the people that could be buying research but just can’t afford it or can’t do it right now because they don’t have the timelines,” Graves said. “We’re actually creating this new category for marketers to gain access to answers to these questions that they’ve had.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During his tenure, he backed Indian startups such as Meesho, Khatabook, CredAvenue, Bounce, and Bizongo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are living through one of the most profound technological revolutions in history, and one of the toughest tests of investor discipline,” Narang wrote. “AI scales thought itself, compressing the gap between idea and output. The founders who pair that speed with pricing power and improving unit economics will define the next generation of enduring value.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside developing the new investment platform, Narang told founders that he is taking 1% to 2% personal stakes in companies he believes can “compound intelligently.” This suggests he plans to stay active in early-stage investing while setting up a broader vehicle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">B Capital confirmed Narang’s exit to TechCrunch and noted that Eduardo Saverin, Karan Mohla, and Howard Morgan would manage its Asia portfolio alongside the existing team in South and Southeast Asia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After more than eight years with the firm, Kabir Narang, who focused on later stage growth investing efforts in Asia, has left his role to pursue other opportunities,” a B Capital spokesperson said. “We are grateful for his contributions, and we wish him continued success in the future.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2015 by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and former Bain Capital executive Raj Ganguly, B Capital is a multi-stage investor focused on technology, healthcare, and resilience tech.

Cursor also confirmed the existence of those models in November when it said in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/series-d\">blog post</a>, “Our in-house models now generate more code than almost any other LLMs in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His comments about the models came up at Fortune’s event when the founder was asked how he plans to compete with the LLM makers that he relies on when the major ones — OpenAI, Anthropic — have their own AI coding offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truell likened their coding products to “a concept car,” whereas his product is a production automobile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It would be like taking an engine and a concept car around it instead of a whole end-to-end car that was manufactured,” Truell said. “What we do is we take the best intelligence that the market has to offer from many different providers. And we also do our own product-specific models in places. We take that, we build it together and integrate it, then also build the best tool and end UX for working with AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cursor’s dependence on its competitors — and its need to build its own LLMs — has been a subject of speculation among VCs in Silicon Valley since earlier this year when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/why-openai-wanted-to-buy-cursor-but-opted-for-the-fast-growing-windsurf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI reportedly looked at Anysphere</a> as an acquisition target. Anysphere turned the idea down. (This was around the same time that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Windsurf’s OpenAI deal also didn’t materialize</a>, with the founder eventually joining Google.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue, investors told TechCrunch, was that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/more-details-emerge-on-how-windsurfs-vcs-and-founders-got-paid-from-the-google-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI coding editors were losing money</a> thanks to high costs they paid to the model makers. In Cursor’s case, instead of selling, it adjusted pricing to a usage model in July, directly passing along the API fees that model makers charge to its users. This change from an all-inclusive subscription fee (and the surprise big bills some customers faced) caused <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an uproar among some of its users</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, when asked about the pricing kerfuffle, Truell said, “When we started Cursor, you would turn to Cursor for a quick JavaScript question and now you’re turning to it to do hours of work for you. So the pricing model had to shift for us and others in the space. That means shifting more towards a consumption model,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truell added that one of the tools the company is working on is cloud-computing-like cost-management tools, which lets enterprises monitor their total usage and keep tabs on the bills their engineers are running up.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a whole team internally dedicated to enterprise engineering and building things like spend controls and billing groups and visibility,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, he said Cursor is focused on two major areas for the next year. One is handling more complex agentic functions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want you to take end-to-end tasks, ones that are concise to specify but then are really hard to do, and have them entirely be done by Cursor. An example is a bug fix,” Truell explained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He particularly wants Cursor to be able to fix the kinds of bugs that might be easy to describe but take “weeks of someone’s time, thousands of times running the code” to handle. “We want Cursor to do that, end-to-end,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other area he named, but didn’t explain with much detail, was the idea of “thinking about teams as the atomic unit that we serve,” he said. This must be in contrast to serving individual coders, and a hint to how well its enterprise business is going. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to cost-monitoring features, Truell said he wants Cursor to handle more parts of the software development life cycle outside of writing code. He pointed to Cursor’s code review product as an example, which he said is being used by some customers to analyze every pull request, be it written by AI or human. (A pull request is when a programmer submits code for review before it is merged into the main project.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So you’ll see us start to help teams more as a whole,” with more features like that, he promised.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, big competitors are also all gearing up for the complex-task agentic world. Amazon just released a coding tool it promises can <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">already run for days on end</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just this week, the AI power players, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, and <a href=\"https://aaif.io/members/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many others</a>, launched a new consortium under the Linux Foundation to develop open source agentic interoperability standards. They even contributed some of their key projects, like Anthropic’s wildly popular Model Context Protocol (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/github-microsoft-embrace-anthropics-spec-for-connecting-ai-models-to-data-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MCP</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His plans for the year likely won’t put Anysphere firmly ahead of Cursor’s main model-maker competitors. They should, however, keep the company in the race.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian has spent nearly two years building its own AI assistant, an effort that remains separate from its multibillion-dollar technology joint venture with Volkswagen, TechCrunch has learned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian hasn’t revealed when it will put the AI assistant in consumers hands. However, in an interview earlier this year, Rivian’s software chief Wassym Bensaid told TechCrunch it was targeting the end of the year. The company will likely share more during its upcoming <a href=\"https://rivian.com/autonomy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI &amp; Autonomy Day</a>, which will be livestreamed starting at 9 a.m. PT December 11.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian’s plans are reflective of the moment as the pace of development from foundational AI companies — the tech giants and startups like Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI that are building the core models and infrastructure — accelerates and industries scramble to keep up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as Bensaid noted to TechCrunch earlier this year, this isn’t some slapdash effort to stay on trend. Nor is it simply a chatbot thrown into the infotainment system. The company has put considerable thought, resources, and time into the product, Bensaid said, noting that it’s designed to be integrated with all vehicle controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company started with an underlying philosophy to build an overall architecture that is model and platform agnostic, according to Bensaid. The Rivian AI assistant team, which is based out of the company’s Palo Alto office, soon realized effort and attention should also be directed toward developing the software layers that help coordinate various workflows as well as the control logic that resolves conflicts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And that’s the in-vehicle platform we have built,” Bensaid said. “We use what the industry loves to now call an agentic framework; but we thought about that architecture since very early so that we can interface with different models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The in-house AI assistant program is consistent with Rivian’s push to become more vertically integrated. In 2024, Rivian <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/06/rivian-refresh-r1t-r1s-second-generation-speed-range-apple/\">overhauled its flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV</a>, changing everything from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, sensor stack, and software user interface. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also put considerable resources toward developing and improving its own software stack, which includes everything related to real-time operating systems (RTOS) that manage the car, such as thermal dynamics, ADAS, and safety systems, as well as another layer related to the infotainment system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bensaid didn’t provide detailed information about the AI assistant, but he did say it includes a mix of models that handle specific tasks. The result is a hybrid software stack that combines edge AI, where tasks are handled on the device, and cloud AI, in which large models that require more compute are handled by remote servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This should mean a flexible, customized AI assistant that splits the workload between the edge and cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian developed much of the AI software stack in-house, including its own custom models and the “orchestration layer,” the conductor or traffic cop of sorts that makes sure the various AI models work together. Rivian tapped other companies for specific agentic AI functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The mission is to develop an AI assistant that increases customer trust and engagement, Bensaid said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the AI assistant is staying within Rivian. The company’s joint venture with Volkswagen is focused on software, but not an AI assistant or anything to do with automated driving.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The technology joint venture with Volkswagen, which was announced in 2024 and is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/the-rivian-volkswagen-joint-venture-deal-is-now-up-to-5-8b/\">worth up to $5.8 billion</a>, is centered on the underlying electrical architecture and zonal compute, and infotainment. The joint venture officially kicked off in November 2024 and is expected to supply the electrical architecture and software for Volkswagen Group as early as 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autonomy and AI are separate for now, but “it doesn’t mean that it may not be in the future,” Bensaid said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Fifty-nine percent of teens say they use ChatGPT, which is more than twice as popular as the next two most-used chatbots, Google’s Gemini (23%) and Meta AI (20%). Forty-six percent of U.S. teens say that they use AI chatbots at least several times a week, while 36% report not using AI chatbots at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pew’s research also details how race, age, and class impact teen chatbot use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">About 68% of Black and Hispanic teens surveyed said they use chatbots, compared to 58% of white respondents. In particular, Black teens were about twice as likely to use Gemini and Meta AI as white teens.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The racial and ethnic differences in teen chatbot use were striking […] but it’s tough to speculate about the reasons behind those differences,” Pew Research Associate Michelle Faverio told TechCrunch. “This pattern is consistent with other racial and ethnic differences we’ve seen in teen technology use.

When it comes to household income, about 62% of teens living in households making more than $75,000 per year said they use ChatGPT, compared to 52% of teens below that threshold. But Character.AI usage is twice as popular (14%) in homes with incomes below $75,000.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While teenagers may start out using these tools for basic questions or homework help, their relationship to AI chatbots can become <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">addictive and potentially harmful</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The families of at least two teens, Adam Raine and Amaurie Lacey, have sued ChatGPT maker OpenAI for its alleged role in their children’s suicides — in both cases, ChatGPT gave the teenagers detailed instructions on how to hang themselves, which were tragically effective. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/openai-claims-teen-circumvented-safety-features-before-suicide-that-chatgpt-helped-plan/\">claims</a> it should not be held liable for Raine’s death because the sixteen-year-old allegedly circumvented ChatGPT’s safety features and thus violated the chatbot’s terms of service; the company has yet to respond to the Lacey family’s complaint.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Character.AI, an AI role-playing platform, is also facing scrutiny for its impact on teen mental health; at least <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/magazine/character-ai-chatbot-lawsuit-teen-suicide-free-speech.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">two teenagers</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/lawsuit-characterai-chatbot-colorado-suicide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">died by suicide</a> after having prolonged conversations with AI chatbots. The startup ended up making the decision to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/character-ai-is-killing-the-chatbot-experience-for-minors/\">stop offering its chatbots to minors</a>, and instead launched a product called “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/character-ai-will-offer-interactive-stories-to-kids-instead-of-open-ended-chat/\">Stories</a>” for underage users that more closely resembles a choose-your-own-adventure game.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The experiences reflected in the lawsuits against these companies make up a small percentage of all interactions that happen on ChatGPT or Character.AI. In many cases, conversations with chatbots can be incredibly benign. According to OpenAI’s data, only <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-says-over-a-million-people-talk-to-chatgpt-about-suicide-weekly/\">0.15% of ChatGPT’s active users</a> have conversations about suicide each week — but on a platform with 800 million weekly active users, that small percentage reflects over one million people who discuss suicide with the chatbot per week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Even if [AI companies’] tools weren’t designed for emotional support, people are using them in that way, and that means companies do have a responsibility to adjust their models to be solving for user well-being,” Dr. Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and director of Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Boom said it will announce more details about a turbine factory next year, with first deliveries occurring in 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To commercialize its Superpower stationary turbine, Boom raised $300 million in a round led by Darsana Capital Partners with participation from Altimeter Capital, Ark Invest, Bessemer Venture Partners, Robinhood Ventures, and Y Combinator. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Profits from the sale of Superpower units will go toward funding continued development of the company’s Overture supersonic aircraft, Boom founder and CEO Blake Scholl told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an arrangement that Scholl likens to SpaceX’s Starlink satellite constellation. The satellite internet service is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/starlink-profit-growing-rapidly-as-it-faces-a-moment-of-promise-and-peril/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly profitable</a>, helping the company to bankroll the development of its rockets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve been kind of keeping my eyes open for 10 years for what could be our Starlink,” he said. “I said no to a thousand things because I concluded they were distractions. This one we’re saying yes to because it’s so clearly on path.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boom said Superpower and its airborne engine called Symphony share 80% of their parts. Earlier this year, Boom’s XB-1 demonstrator was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/booms-xb-1-becomes-first-civil-aircraft-to-go-supersonic/\">the first civil aircraft</a> developed by a private company to break the sound barrier.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crusoe is paying $1,033 per kilowatt of generating capacity. For that, Boom will deliver the turbines, generators, control systems, and preventative maintenance. Crusoe will have to provide everything else, including pollution controls, electrical connections, and so on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s on the higher side for that type of power plant. A <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/powerplants/capitalcost/pdf/capital_cost_AEO2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">typical airplane-derived</a> — or aeroderivative — turbine costs around $1,600 per kilowatt, a price that also includes pollution controls, engineering, construction, land acquisition, permitting, pipelines, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a typical project, the turbine and pollution controls contribute about 46% of a project’s total cost. Applying that percentage to Boom’s figures would likely push the total cost to over $2,000 per kilowatt. That’s pricey for a simple-cycle gas turbine and <a href=\"https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/gas-turbine-prices-are-up-and-arent-going-down-anytime-soon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more in line</a> with costs for combined-cycle gas turbines slated to come online in the early 2030s.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boom’s Superpower is targeting 39% efficiency, similar to competitors. Combined cycle turbines can recover heat from the exhaust to boost efficiency above 60%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boom is also developing a “field upgrade” to convert its turbines from simple cycle to combined cycle, Scholl said. Operators could do so today using existing combined-cycle kits, though adding them would require longer installation times. “Those combined-cycle plants tend to be construction projects,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other aeroderivative turbine generators, Superpower will be delivered in a shipping container, and developers like Crusoe will be responsible for electrical and gas hookups in addition to pollution controls. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scholl said the power plants should be “no louder” than existing aeroderivative turbines, though that’s not exactly quiet: Residents near xAI’s Colossus data center report hearing similarly sized turbines from <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/24/southaven-residents-fear-pollution-complain-of-noise-from-elon-musks-xai-data-center-turbines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">at least half a mile away</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first few stationary turbines will be made at Boom’s existing facilities while the company builds a larger factory. The goal is to produce 1 gigawatts’ worth in 2028, 2 gigawatts’ worth in 2029, and 4 gigawatts’ worth in 2030. If Boom can hit those numbers, it would represent a <a href=\"https://rmi.org/gas-turbine-supply-constraints-threaten-grid-reliability-more-affordable-near-term-solutions-can-help/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">significant expansion</a> in the turbines available to be deployed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boom still has a challenging few years ahead of it. If the company can pull it off, supersonic commercial flights could happen sooner than even Boom expected. But scaling production is never easy, and many startups have struggled to cross the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/27/climate-startup-valley-of-death/\">valley of death</a> that separates early-stage hardware companies from their commercial peers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These could include family members, friends and neighbors, delivery drivers, household staff, and others. After you label someone in the Ring app, the device will recognize them as they approach the Ring’s camera. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, instead of alerting you that “a person is at your door,” you’ll receive a personalized notification, like “Mom at Front Door,” the company explains in its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/amazons-ring-to-partner-with-flock-a-network-of-ai-cameras-used-by-ice-feds-and-police/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launch announcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature has already received pushback from consumer protection organizations, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/legal-case-against-rings-face-recognition-feature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like the EFF</a>, and a U.S. senator. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon Ring owners can use the feature to help them disable alerts they don’t want to see — like those notifications referencing their own comings and goings, for instance, the company says. And they can set these alerts on a per-face basis.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is not enabled by default. Instead, users will need to turn it on in their app’s settings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, faces can be named in the app directly from the Event History section or from the new Familiar Faces library. Once labeled, the face will be named in all notifications, in the app’s timeline, and in the Event History. These labels can be edited at any time, and there are tools to merge duplicates or delete faces.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon claims the face data is encrypted and never shared with others.

More recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/amazons-ring-to-partner-with-flock-a-network-of-ai-cameras-used-by-ice-feds-and-police/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon partnered with Flock</a>, the maker of AI-powered surveillance cameras used by police, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-secret-service-navy-all-had-access-to-flocks-nationwide-network-of-cameras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">federal law enforcement, and ICE</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ring’s own security efforts have fallen short in the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/amazon-ring-ftc-settlement-lax-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ring had to pay a $5.8 million fine in 2023</a> after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission found that Ring employees and contractors had broad and unrestricted access to customers’ videos for years. Its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/ring-neighbors-exposed-locations-addresses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Neighbors app also exposed</a> users’ home addresses and precise locations, and users’ <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/ring-doorbell-passwords-exposed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ring passwords</a> have been floating around the dark web for years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given Amazon’s willingness to work with law enforcement and digital surveillance providers, combined with its poor security track record, we’d suggest Ring owners, at the very least, be careful about identifying anyone using their proper name; better yet, keep the feature disabled and just look to see who it is. Not everything needs an AI upgrade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result of the privacy concerns, Amazon’s Ring has already faced calls from U.S. senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) to <a href=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-demands-amazon-abandon-plan-to-include-facial-recognition-technology-in-ring-doorbells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">abandon this feature</a>, and is facing backlash from consumer protection organizations, like the EFF. Privacy laws are preventing Amazon from launching the feature in <a href=\"https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/ILCS/Articles?ActID=3004&amp;ChapterID=57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Illinois</a>, <a href=\"https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/docs/bc/htm/bc.503.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Texas</a>, and Portland, Oregon, the EFF had also noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/ring-answers-familiar-faces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">questions posed by the organization</a>, Amazon said the users’ biometric data will be processed in the cloud and claimed it doesn’t use the data to train AI models. It also claimed it wouldn’t be able to identify all the locations where a person had been detected, from a technical standpoint, even if law enforcement requested this data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it’s unclear why that would not be the case, given the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/ring-cameras-can-now-recognize-faces-and-help-to-find-lost-pets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">similarity to the “Search Party” feature</a> that looks across a neighborhood’s network of Ring cameras to find lost dogs and cats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reached for comment, EFF’s Staff Attorney, F. Mario Trujillo, said, “Knocking on a door, or even just walking in front of it, shouldn’t require abandoning your privacy. With this feature going live, it’s more important than ever that state privacy regulators step in to investigate, protect people’s privacy, and test the strength of their biometric privacy laws.” <br></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated after publication with EFF comment.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Family Protection is <a href=\"https://corporate.truecaller.com/newsroom/press-release/CE48ACDE76C40843\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">initially rolling out</a> as a pilot for Android and iOS users in Sweden, Chile, Malaysia, and Kenya.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truecaller said the feature is designed so that the more digitally confident person in a household can handle scam controls on behalf of less tech-savvy family members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Android, the family administrator can receive alerts during suspected scam calls; view basic device status, including battery level; and remotely end calls flagged as fraudulent, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scam activity has been rising worldwide as more people come online. That activity has exploded in markets where first-time smartphone users and older adults are more exposed to fraud. Countries, including India, have <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2119782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported sharp increases</a> in impersonation attempts and multi-step schemes that exploit gaps in digital familiarity.

The trend prompted the launch of the multi-user protection system, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Family Protection is available as a free feature to users.

The company says its community also reports around 166 million spam calls daily, creating one of the largest datasets of phone-based fraud activity globally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Truecaller faces new competition in India, its largest market, as the government there starts trials of a <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/business/spam-calls-dot-to-mandate-display-of-kyc-registered-names-on-incoming-calls/article70352353.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Caller Name Presentation system</a> that will display the name registered with telecom providers on incoming calls. Truecaller has been adding features that go beyond caller ID, including Family Protection, as it adapts to regulatory and market changes in India and other key markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Family Protection, one person’s vigilance now strengthens safety for up to five family members,” said Jhunjhunwala, adding that the company aims to extend protection without requiring additional effort from users.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The space agency told TechCrunch that Canoo “was no longer able to meet our mission requirements.” As of October, NASA said it is leasing the Airstream-built “Astrovan” from Boeing that the aerospace company <a href=\"https://www.airstream.com/space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">commissioned for its own crewed space missions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the USPS said in an emailed statement the six vehicles it purchased “for evaluation purposes” in 2024 “are no longer in use.” The “evaluation has been completed,” the postal service wrote, and “no further investments are anticipated.” The USPS declined to share any details or final results of the evaluation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canoo also provided at least one demonstration vehicle to the Department of Defense (DOD) before its bankruptcy. The DOD did not respond to emailed requests about whether it has continued using the van.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canoo filed for bankruptcy in January 2025 after years of financial struggles and failing to establish a market for its electric vans. Soon after, former CEO Tony Aquila made a $4 million bid <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/canoos-ceo-is-buying-the-bankrupt-ev-startups-assets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">for the startup’s assets in March</a>. Aquila told the bankruptcy trustee that a “principal motivation” for buying the assets was his “desire to honor [Canoo’s] commitment to provide service and support for certain government programs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NASA and the USPS declined to share whether Aquila ever approached either agency about supporting the vehicles. Aquila did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer who represented Aquila in the bankruptcy proceedings also did not respond. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bankruptcy judge <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/canoo-ceo-can-buy-bankrupt-ev-startups-assets-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">approved the sale to Aquila in April</a>. He was not the only entity interested in buying the company’s assets, though. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As many as eight parties signed NDAs to evaluate Canoo’s intellectual property, prototypes, and equipment, the bankruptcy trustee said at the time. A lawyer for Canoo said a handful of those parties came close to making a bid. One was Harbinger, a California-based electric trucking company that was created by former Canoo employees in 2021. Another was a mysterious financier from the U.K. named Charles Garson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger, at the time, had accused Canoo of hiding assets from the sale process. It also claimed the bankruptcy trustee had “unfairly favored Mr. Aquila” by accepting his offer without widely marketing the bankrupt company’s assets. Garson claimed to be willing to pay as much as $20 million for Canoo’s assets, but the judge ultimately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/mystery-investors-attempt-to-stop-canoo-asset-sale-shot-down-by-judge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decided the investor did not formalize his bid in time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The trustee and lawyers for Canoo argued that Aquila presented the best and most firm bid. They also claimed one of the other potential bidders — though they never specified who — could have raised concerns with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States because of its “foreign ownership.” Lawyers for Aquila and Canoo flagged this as a particular problem in light of the contracts with NASA, the USPS, and the DOD. Harbinger and Garson declined to comment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Anchoring the AAIF at launch are donations from Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is donating its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/github-microsoft-embrace-anthropics-spec-for-connecting-ai-models-to-data-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MCP</a> (Model Context Protocol), a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/anthropic-proposes-a-way-to-connect-data-to-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">standard way to connect models and agents</a> to tools and data; Block is contributing Goose, its open source agent framework; and OpenAI is bringing <a href=\"http://agents.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AGENTS.md</a> to the table, its simple instruction file developers can add to a repository to tell AI coding tools how to behave. You can think of these tools as the basic plumbing of the agent era. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other members in the AAIF include<strong> </strong>AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, and Google, signaling an industry-level push for shared guardrails so that AI agents can be trustworthy at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In OpenAI engineer Nick Cooper’s view, protocols are essentially a shared language that lets different <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-agentkit-to-help-developers-build-and-ship-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">agents</a> and systems work together without every developer reinventing integrations from scratch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need multiple [protocols] to negotiate, communicate, and work together to deliver value for people, and that sort of openness and communication is why it’s not ever going to be one provider, one host, one company,” Cooper told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/13/jim-zemlin-on-taking-a-portfolio-approach-to-linux-foundation-projects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jim Zemlin</a>, executive director of the Linux Foundation, put it more bluntly in conversations around the launch: The goal is to avoid a future of “closed wall” proprietary stacks, where tool connections, agent behavior, and orchestration are locked behind a handful of platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By bringing these projects together under the AAIF, we are now able to coordinate interoperability, safety patterns, and best practices specifically for AI agents,” Zemlin said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Block — the fintech company behind Square and Cash App — isn’t known for AI infrastructure, but it’s making an openness play with Goose. AI tech lead Brad Axen frames it as proof that open alternatives can match proprietary agents at scale, with thousands of engineers using it weekly for coding, data analysis, and documentation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Open sourcing Goose serves a dual purpose for Block. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Getting it out into the world gives us a place for other people to come help us make it better,” Axen told TechCrunch. “We have a lot of contributors from open source, and everything they do to improve it comes back to our company.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, donating Goose to the Linux Foundation gives Block access to community stress tests while positioning it as a working example of AAIF’s vision — an agent framework designed to plug into shared building blocks like MCP and AGENTS.md.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is making a similar move at the protocol layer, handing MCP to the Linux Foundation. The goal: make MCP the neutral infrastructure connecting AI models to tools, data, and applications without endless one-off adapters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The main goal is to have enough adoption in the world that it’s the de facto standard,” MCP co-creator David Soria Parra told TechCrunch. “We’re all better off if we have an open integration center where you can build something once as a developer and use it across any client.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Donating MCP to AAIF signals that the protocol won’t be controlled by a single vendor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That governance point is central to why the Linux Foundation created a new umbrella at all. The organization already hosts major AI and developer infrastructure projects — everything from PyTorch and Ray to Kubernetes — but says AAIF is specifically aimed at agent standards and orchestration, including shared safety patterns and interoperability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AAIF’s structure is funded through a “directed fund,” meaning companies can contribute money through membership dues. But Zemlin of the Linux Foundation argues that funding doesn’t equal control: Project roadmaps are set by technical steering committees, and no single member gets unilateral say over direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the big question is whether AAIF becomes real infrastructure or just another industry logo alliance. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“An early indicator of success, in addition to adoption of these standards, would be the development and implementation of shared standards being used by vendor agents around the world,” Zemlin said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For OpenAI’s Cooper, success would look like an evolution of standards: “I don’t want it to be a stagnant thing. I don’t want these protocols to be part of this foundation, and that’s where they sat for two years. They should evolve and continually accept further input.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a more subtle consequence: Even with open governance, one company’s implementation could become the default simply because it ships fastest or gains the most usage. Zemlin says that’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. He points to open source history — like Kubernetes “winning” the container race — as evidence that “dominance emerges from merit and not vendor control.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For developers and enterprises, the short-term appeal is clear: less time building custom connectors, more predictable agent behavior across codebases, and simpler deployment in security-conscious environments. <br>The larger vision is more ambitious: If tools like MCP, AGENTS.md, and Goose become standard infrastructure, the agent landscape could shift from closed platforms to an open, mix-and-match software world reminiscent of the interoperable systems that built the modern web.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That is what I felt when unboxing Fairphone’s <a href=\"https://shop.fairphone.com/nl/fairbuds-xl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new $229 Fairbuds XL over-the-ear headphones</a> in the forest green shade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new headphones, which also come in black, compete with others on the market, like Nothing Headphones (1), Sony’s previous-gen WH-1000XM5, and Sonos Ace. While some of those offer better sound and noise cancellation capabilities, Fairbuds XL would be a good bet if longevity and repairability matter more to you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new devices are an update to the Fairbuds XL with noise cancellation, first launched in 2023 and designed with repairability in mind. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On these headphones, owners can replace the battery, cushions, speaker covers, headband, and drivers on both the new and older models. To make repairs, you can easily open the headphones with a guitar pick or a credit card and a basic screwdriver. The company has tutorials on its YouTube channel to guide you through the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new iteration carries that same ethos but includes some subtle design changes as well as a driver upgrade to improve performance. Specifically, the company said that the driver size is still 40mm, but it’s been upgraded with better magnets for improved bass.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite installing new drivers with enhanced bass, the overall sound signature is largely neutral. Both mids and vocals came through while listening to songs. For instance, some of the tracks on the “K-Pop Demon Hunter” album have some bass-heavy sections, but that didn’t cloud the vocals or synth. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074050\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Fairphone</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The design changes include making the speaker-to-speaker cable and the joystick green instead of orange.

You can use the joystick to play and pause, control volume, and switch to the next or previous track. The button also acts as a switch for pairing mode and lets you cycle between noise cancellation modes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone is not alone in prioritizing a functional button.

While I work from home, there is a lot of noise in the neighborhood, and I prefer to wear noise-cancellation earbuds or headphones. You won’t get AirPods’ level of noise cancellation with these devices, but the experience was still good. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone CTO Chandler Hatton said that the release cycle of the headphones and backward compatibility is a conscious choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can release the products faster. This is a conscientious decision to do it a little bit more slowly. We’d like to show the industry that it’s not necessary to push products out of the market by introducing a new one, because this creates the cycle of what’s sometimes referred to as planned obsolescence,” she told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company noted that it uses fair-mined and recycled materials to build these headphones. To reduce packaging waste, its box just contains a simple protective pouch and the headphones themselves, along with a quick-start guide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This company claims the device’s battery life is up to 30 hours, but this is reduced if you have active noise cancellation on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lack of a headphone jack in favor of USB-C bugged me a bit. Even if you don’t want to add extra accessories to your package, adding support for a standard audio jack is something that could also make the headphones compatible with more audio devices. (You can pick up a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle from Fairphone at around $15.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone has gone through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/28/fairphone-ceo-eva-gouwens-to-step-down/\">a few executive</a> changes in the last two years. The company said that the new management wants to prove that it can produce and distribute gadgets at scale, and the U.S. expansion is part of that plan. The headphones are one of the company’s first products to get a full release in the U.S. and will include support for replacement parts and a three-year warranty. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While consumers can buy the Fairbuds XL on Fairphone’s site, the device will launch on Amazon later this month for U.S. customers, along with the company’s $99 wireless earbuds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s one way to look at Tuesday’s <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/12/making-it-easier-to-create-discover-and-share-content-on-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement</a> from the company formerly known as Facebook: Meta is revamping its flagship app with a number of features focused on connecting friends, along with design changes, including a renewed focus on what still works, like its popular Facebook Marketplace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes come days after news of Meta considering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/meta-reportedly-plans-to-slash-metaverse-budget-by-up-to-30/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sizable cuts to its metaverse efforts</a>, which, before the AI boom, aimed to make virtual worlds and VR the company’s next big bet in social networking. Meanwhile, Facebook still reaches <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">billions</a>, even if its <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/02/5-facts-about-how-americans-use-facebook-two-decades-after-its-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growth remains flat</a> in key markets like the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Facebook’s population ages, the app remains in heavy use among boomers and Gen Xers. That’s led Meta to try to find a footing among a younger demographic. After failed attempts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/02/facebook-is-shutting-down-its-college-student-only-social-network-campus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reboot Facebook as a home for college kids</a>, the company has been making more noise recently around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/mark-zuckerberg-teases-a-2025-return-to-og-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">giving Facebook a Gen Z makeover</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s been resonating with younger people <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/business/gen-z-facebook-marketplace.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is Facebook Marketplace</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s online marketplace is used by more than half of its Gen Z users in the U.S., according to a <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/us-social-media-users-by-generation-2025?_gl=1*emvoar*_gcl_au*MTgwMzY4ODczLjE3NjUyMjk5MTQ.*_ga*OTU4NDcyMDc2LjE3NjUyMjk5MTQ.*_ga_XXYLHB9SXG*czE3NjUyMjk5MTQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjUyMjk5MTQkajYwJGwwJGgxMDUyNjUyMzU2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2025 eMarketer report</a> on social media users. Last month, Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/11/facebook-marketplace-gets-a-glow-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirmed the trend</a>, noting that Marketplace was used by one out of four young adult daily active Facebook users in the U.S. and Canada.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the traction, however, Marketplace has remained buried in the “More” menu under users’ profiles in the Facebook app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new update, rolling out soon, will add Marketplace to the app’s bottom navigation bar, alongside other social and creator-focused features like Reels and Friends.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074131\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg 1454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=768,679 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=1200,1061 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=1280,1132 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=430,380 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=720,637 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=900,796 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=800,708 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=668,591 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=424,375 424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=698,617 698w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=600,531 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reels and direct messaging have been the most popular features on Instagram, the company said earlier this year, which is why it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/instagram-is-testing-a-reels-first-ui-in-india-and-south-korea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">began testing a redesign that centered those</a> in the mobile experience. Now Facebook is getting similar treatment in terms of recentering friends as part of the experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Profile tab will remain in the navigation bar, and users will be able to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/www/2741283262582983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">customize the experience</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another part of the makeover will allow users to double-tap photos in their Feed to like them, similar to Instagram. These photos will be arranged in a standardized grid, and users will be able to see photos full-screen by clicking them.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Feed-Updates_final.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074123\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Search is changing to include a more immersive grid layout to support all content types. Facebook will also test a new full-screen viewer that would let you explore photo and video results without losing your place.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Facebook says it’s making it easier to create Stories and regular posts by making tools for adding music or tagging friends more visible, and eliminating other distractions. Audience and cross-posting settings will now be more prominently displayed as well.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Feed_creation_final.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074125\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commenting across Feed, Groups, and Reels is getting its own set of tweaks. Replies are getting more streamlined, badges will be more visible, and users get new pinning tools. Meta says this will make conversations easier to follow, and expanded controls will let creators and admins more easily monitor conversations. Plus, everyone will be able to anonymously flag irrelevant comments and users who disrupt the conversation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Feed, users will be able to give feedback as to why they don’t like a post or Reel to better personalize their experience.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg 1464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=300,264 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=768,676 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=680,598 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=1200,1056 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=1280,1126 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=430,378 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=720,633 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=900,792 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=800,704 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=668,588 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=426,375 426w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=701,617 701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=604,531 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A final change sees Facebook trying to regain its reputation as a place for connecting friends. That’s something it was once known best for, before prioritizing other types of content like news and creator videos, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/in-antitrust-hearing-zuckerberg-admits-facebook-has-copied-its-competition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trying to</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/17/metas-latest-experiment-copies-bereal-and-snapchats-core-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">copy</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/10/facebook-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">or</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/facebook-acquires-anonymous-teen-compliment-app-tbh-will-let-it-run/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquire</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/facebook-acquires-activity-tracking-app-moves/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">every</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/facebook-acquires-branch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">semi</a>–<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/to-boost-commerce-in-ads-facebook-buys-and-shuts-down-shopping-site-thefind/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">successful</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/01/facebook-beluga/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">social</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/20/facebook-buys-hot-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">app</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is rolling out updated user profiles, letting people add more information about their interests, hobbies, and travel. Here, users can include more information about themselves, like what TV shows they like, what music they’re streaming, favorite travel spots, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These are the kinds of things people used to share more freely before they realized that Facebook was only using their data to better target ads. The company is now throwing users a bone in terms of new functionality, at least — if you share that you enjoy something like baking your own bread, or are planning a trip to a certain city, for instance, it will connect you with friends who share the interest or who can give tips.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074130\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg 1460w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=300,264 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=768,676 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=680,599 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=1200,1057 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=1280,1127 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=430,379 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=720,634 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=900,793 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=800,705 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=668,588 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=426,375 426w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=700,617 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=603,531 603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, Facebook has long had the habit of trying to juice engagement by pushing every profile update to your Feed, like if you changed your profile picture or background photo — a feature many Facebook users <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/140uecb/how_do_you_upload_a_new_facebook_cover_photo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">found</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/how-to-update-cover-photo-on-facebook-without-posting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">annoying</a> and even embarrassing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this revamp, however, users will be able to decide if those updates are shared to their Feed, a decision that could increase adoption, Facebook hopes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes could impact how content is ranked in users’ Feeds, which is already a personalized experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the new features will roll out globally over the weeks ahead.
