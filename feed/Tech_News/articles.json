The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s ‘free delivery’ claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies  it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,”  said Christopher Mufarrige, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/12/instacart-pay-60-million-consumer-refunds-settle-ftc-lawsuit-over-allegations-it-engaged-deceptive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a statement</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instacart acknowledged the settlement in a <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/how-instacart-goes-above-and-beyond-for-customers-simplicity-transparency-and-billions-in-savings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The settlement comes as Instacart is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/study-shows-instacart-may-be-charging-some-shoppers-20-more-for-the-same-product/\">currently under fire</a> over a <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/money/questionable-business-practices/instacart-ai-pricing-experiment-inflating-grocery-bills-a1142182490/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent study</a> that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores. Instacart responded to the controversy by stating that retailers determine their own prices, and any pricing tests conducted through its AI tool are random and not influenced by user data. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/ftc-investigating-instacarts-ai-pricing-tool-source-says-2025-12-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reuters</a> reported on Wednesday the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/instacarts-ai-driven-pricing-tool-attracted-attention-now-the-ftc-has-questions/\">FTC has begun an investigation</a> into the delivery platform’s AI pricing tool.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://platform.openai.com/apps-manage\"> OpenAI Developer platform</a>, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a big step for OpenAI towards expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it. </p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Shortly thereafter, the crypto exchange Coinbase separately appointed Osborne to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/coinbase-appoints-uk-ex-finance-minister-george-osborne-run-advisory-council-2025-12-18/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lead its internal advisory council</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcements drew particular attention in the U.K., where commenters noted that Osborne joins a <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/openai_george_osborne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growing list</a> of former British politicians now working for major U.S. tech companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’re not familiar with him or this trend, here’s what you need to know.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-has-osborne-s-career-looked-like\">What has Osborne’s career looked like?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A former conservative Member of Parliament, George Osborne served as chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016 — a role equivalent to that of a finance minister or treasury secretary in other countries, and currently held by Rachel Reeves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Prime Minister David Cameron resigned following the 2016 Brexit vote, Osborne eventually left public office in 2017. Alongside multiple other engagements, including a part-time advisory role for the investment firm BlackRock, he served as editor of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Standard_(London_newspaper)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Evening Standard</a> from 2017 to 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During that period, he also co-founded a VC firm, <a href=\"https://www.9yardscapital.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">9yards Capital</a>, with his brother Theo and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1af594c-fef5-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Theo’s brother-in-law David Fisher</a> as co-founders and managing partners. Several companies in 9yards’ portfolio have gone public since then — including Robinhood, Toast, and Coinbase. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-his-new-role-at-openai\">What’s his new role at OpenAI?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Osborne <a href=\"https://x.com/George_Osborne/status/2000982429247365479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on X that he was joining OpenAI “as managing director and head of OpenAI for [C]ountries, based here in London.” He will help expand existing partnerships and build new ones, OpenAI chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-lehane-2562535_ive-spent-enough-time-in-government-to-know-activity-7406755715211628546-NpvR/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Introduced in May 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/openai-wants-to-team-up-with-governments-to-grow-ai-infrastructure/\">OpenAI for Countries</a> is an initiative through which the AI company partners with governments looking to build in-country data center capacity and localize ChatGPT for their language and culture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI for Countries is an extension of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">Stargate project</a>, a $500 billion initiative through which OpenAI is currently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">building five new data centers</a> across the U.S. with Oracle and SoftBank. But beyond infrastructure, its stated goal is to “support countries around the world that would prefer to build on democratic AI rails.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/ten-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turns 10</a>, it is only natural that it starts hiring the kind of talent that won’t get <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/y-combinator-sam-altman-kicked-out-of-the-ritz-for-violating-dress-code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turned down at the Ritz for wearing sport shoes</a>. An Oxford graduate and the son of a baronet, Osborne fits the bill — but his network and reach are even more valuable, and his podcast with former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls, called “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@polcurrency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Political Currency</a>,” underscores his extensive political connections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His track record and contacts could be even more directly relevant for Coinbase, which he was already advising and where he will now “play a much more active role in helping us with policymakers around the world,” the company’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/coinbase-appoints-uk-ex-finance-minister-george-osborne-run-advisory-council-2025-12-18/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Staying on the right side of regulators is particularly important for crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which has been making efforts to influence governments in the U.S. and beyond. But this is also critical for OpenAI, which intends to weigh in as AI gains a foothold in governments’ agendas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Lehane’s LinkedIn post, Osborne’s decision to take the role “reflects a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure — and early decisions about how it’s built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pattern-to-watch\">The pattern to watch</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Osborne’s latest role immediately drew parallels with other high-profile British politicians who went on to join major U.S. tech companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These include former U.K. deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who served as Meta’s policy chief <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/02/meta-policy-chief-nick-clegg-steps-down/\">for over six years</a>, and, more recently, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak taking on advisory roles <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyqe22pz81o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with Microsoft and AI firm Anthropic</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This trend raises different concerns depending on your perspective. Some critics worry about active Members of Parliament like Sunak potentially advocating for U.S. corporate interests while still serving in government. Others take issue with former officials like Osborne leveraging their government experience and connections to secure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/15/george-osborne-investment-management-lingotto-agnelli-exor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">highly lucrative</a> private sector positions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “revolving door” phenomenon between government and the private sector <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">isn’t new</a>. But the practice has attracted heightened scrutiny in Europe, especially when controversial foreign companies — whether tech firms or retailers<a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2025/06/11/macron-defends-former-minister-now-lobbying-for-shein_6742246_5.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> like Shein</a> — hire former <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/11/05/shein-why-french-authorities-struggle-to-regulate-fast-fashion-giant_6747133_7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">government officials</a> to help navigate regulations and influence policy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seen from the other side, this is simply a matter of leveraging skills and experience. In his bio on 9yards’ team page, the VC firm touts that “George devised many regulations that positioned the U.K. as a global fintech leader, including the open banking regime and the FCA ‘sandbox.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others, however, view Osborne’s career moves more critically. They point to his controversial austerity policies as chancellor, and note that he has a history of ethics concerns around the revolving door. For example, when he took the Evening Standard editor job in 2017, he failed to seek approval from the government’s ethics watchdog first — a move that led to the body being criticized as “toothless.” His attitude at the time was telling: “At the age of 45, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor,” Osborne declared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, that mindset — transitioning quickly from public service to high-paying private roles — is precisely what makes his OpenAI and Coinbase appointments part of a broader pattern that concerns ethics watchdogs today.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

India is emerging as the fastest-growing market for profile verification, highlighting the country’s expanding influence on how digital work networks operate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn members are adding around 30 million verifications to their profiles each year, with adoption up more than 38% year-over-year in 2025, according to Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn’s vice president of trust products. The increase follows the company’s announcement last week that <a href=\"https://news.linkedin.com/2025/verified--linkedin-crosses-100m-member-milestone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 100 million users</a> have added at least one verification.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-linkedin-profile-features-help-verify-identity-detect-rodriguez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">began rolling out</a> profile verification to provide clearer signals of authenticity on the platform. It initially focused on confirming members’ workplace or identity, including through company email addresses, before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/linkedin-rolls-out-ways-to-verify-your-identity-and-employment-without-a-price-tag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expanding to government-issued ID checks</a>, and has since been extended to company pages and job listings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most LinkedIn members who have added a verification to their profile have done so by confirming their association with a workplace, typically using a company email address or similar credentials, rather than verifying their personal identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">About 60% of verified members have confirmed a workplace affiliation, typically using a company email address, while roughly 27% have verified their identity using a government-issued ID, Rodriguez said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pace-of-india-growth\">The pace of India growth</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geographically, the U.S. accounts for the largest share of verified users, representing about 40% of the more than 100 million members who have added at least one verification, the company said. India follows closely, alongside other major markets, including the U.K., Canada, Brazil, and France.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the U.S. continues to account for the largest overall share of verified users, India has emerged as LinkedIn’s fastest-growing market for profile verification, Rodriguez said, with adoption rising about 80% over the past 12 months.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is already one of LinkedIn’s largest and fastest-growing user markets globally, with <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/life/technology-india-emerges-as-linkedins-fastest-growing-market-with-16-crore-users-3969636/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 160 million users</a>, and the pace of verification adoption there is unfolding alongside broader growth in professional networking, hiring, and remote work on the platform. This underscores how shifts in India’s workforce are increasingly shaping LinkedIn’s global usage patterns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As verification adoption has grown, LinkedIn has also begun extending those signals beyond its own platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, the Microsoft-owned company launched its “Verified on LinkedIn” program, allowing partner platforms to display LinkedIn verification badges. Zoom is the most recent partner for this move, joining companies such as Adobe and G2. The company also recently introduced a self-serve API to make it easier for other organizations to integrate verification into their own services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn says profile verification is associated with higher engagement on the platform, with verified members seeing up to 60% more profile views and around 50% more interaction on their posts compared with unverified users. Verified company pages also tend to attract more attention, recording significantly higher views and follower growth, the company stated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Verifications provide a powerful signal of authenticity on LinkedIn, helping to support authenticity and trust,” said Rodriguez. “Members with verifications are far more likely to represent real people, and jobs with verifications of the page, and hirer maintain significantly higher integrity and safety standards.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The last decade is filled with examples of fintechs that have reshaped how U.S. businesses manage money. Brex simplified corporate cards. Ramp automated spend controls. Mercury rebuilt startup banking. But this wave of financial innovation has largely skipped one major part of the economy: nonprofits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://givefront.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Givefront</a>, a YC-backed startup founded by 21-year-old Harvard dropout <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-tengtrakool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Matt Tengtrakool</a> and UC Berkeley’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidan-sunbury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Aidan Sunbury</a>, aims to change that. The company is building a financial platform designed specifically for nonprofits, including food banks, animal rescues, non-governmental organizations, churches, and homeowner associations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonprofits generate <a href=\"https://healthysector.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">roughly 6% of the U.S. GDP and contribute trillions of dollars</a> each year, yet most still rely on outdated financial tools. Givefront believes that modern spend management, compliance, and reporting infrastructure — tailored to nonprofit realities — can unlock significant efficiency gains across the sector.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before starting Givefront, Tengtrakool experimented with a microloan aggregation startup in Nigeria. He later worked inside several nonprofits while studying computer science and statistics at Harvard, including running a few organizations himself. At one nonprofit, he helped grow donations to nearly $500,000. Tengtrakool says these experiences revealed a clear gap that nonprofits face. They have strict regulatory and reporting requirements but lack the tools that modern businesses take for granted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve always been interested in financial systems, and this work fits naturally with that,” the chief executive told TechCrunch. “While helping run these nonprofits with a few other students, we realized most of them didn’t have adequate financial tools to ensure compliance or protect their tax-exempt status. The tools they relied on were completely out of sync with what’s considered modern in the startup world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tengtrakool initially built the first version of Givefront to solve those problems internally. What started as tooling for organizations he worked with soon expanded to local nonprofits across the country. Over time, the team narrowed its focus to a unified financial platform built exclusively for registered nonprofit organizations, <a href=\"https://healthysector.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about 1.9 million of them</a> in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Givefront entered Y Combinator Winter 2024 with a broad vision spanning banking and accounting. The team quickly learned, however, that convincing nonprofits to replace accountants or core banking relationships required a slow and painful sales process, ushering a pivot to cards and spend management.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s much easier to get an organization to switch the card they use than to replace their entire accounting stack,” Tengtrakool said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Givefront offers features similar to corporate spend platforms like Ramp and Brex, its exclusive focus on nonprofits sets it apart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonprofits operate under constraints most businesses never face. They manage restricted and unrestricted grants, report spending to donors and foundations, track volunteer expenses, and file IRS Form 990 disclosures. Many nonprofits manage dozens of grants at once, each with its own spending and reporting rules.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Legacy nonprofit systems such as Blackbaud, Sage, and MIP still dominate the market, but they often lack real-time spend controls, modern approval workflows, and seamless integrations with the tools nonprofits increasingly depend on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than replacing these systems outright, Givefront positions itself as a vertical layer that sits on top of them. The platform integrates with legacy accounting software while adding nonprofit-specific spend controls, receipt capture for audits, grant-based budgeting, and automated reporting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many of the workflows we’re building are deeply specific to how this part of the economy works,” Tengtrakool said. “Our workflows and integrations are a 10x improvement when compared to traditional corporate or spend management tools.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Givefront generates revenue from card interchange and subscriptions tied to its bill pay feature. Over time, Givefront plans to expand revenues by launching adjacent products, including payroll, banking, budgeting, and potentially investment and endowment management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching its cards roughly six months ago, Givefront has onboarded hundreds of organizations and reports more than 200% month-over-month growth in revenue and total payment volume. The company expects to serve about 1,000 nonprofits by the end of the year, with a longer-term goal of reaching 5,000 organizations by mid-next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tengtrakool says the team’s youth, which also includes a 17-year-old founding engineer, has served as both an advantage and a challenge so far. Some nonprofit leaders find the team’s age refreshing, while others hesitate to trust financial infrastructure to such a young group. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Churches and religious organizations have driven the strongest adoption, he says. Many rely on volunteer treasurers instead of full-time finance staff, and Givefront’s automation significantly reduces their operational burden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recently closed a $2 million round, led by Script Capital with participation from Y Combinator, C3 Ventures, Phoenix Fund, and angels, including the CEOs of Chariot and Wealthfront. The seed investment will help the company scale distribution, grow its team, and expand its cards and bill pay offerings.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Last week, industry representatives <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/fusion-energy-industry-presses-us-government-billions-support-2025-12-09/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">met with Energy Department officials</a>, urging them to help direct billions of dollars toward fusion projects, and earlier this year, the DOE announced a <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-fusion-science-and-technology-roadmap-accelerate-commercial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new roadmap</a> to guide commercial efforts in the sector, though it didn’t commit any new funds alongside the announcement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG is the parent company of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/\">Truth Social,</a> the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/\">launch</a>, the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG went public last year via a merger with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/\">special-purpose acquisition company</a> (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-25-040977.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">only one experimental device</a> has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</a> and Sam Altman-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/helion-raises-425m-to-help-build-a-fusion-reactor-for-microsoft/\">Helion</a>, are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">in the race</a> to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/google-places-another-fusion-power-bet-on-tae-technologies/\">recent $150 million round</a> from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update 12:05 p.m. ET: Added comments from fusion industry insiders.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The funding comes more than a year after the startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/indias-etherealx-puts-5m-seed-toward-fully-reusable-launch-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised a $5 million seed round</a> in August 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TDK Ventures is co-leading the round with Vietnam-based venture capital firm BIG Capital, with Accel also participating, the sources said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding talks follow EtherealX securing $130 million worth of contracts from six customers, the sources told TechCrunch, underscoring early commercial demand for its launch services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2022 by Manu J. Nair alongside former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Shubhayu Sardar, who serves as chief operating officer, and aerospace engineer Prashant Sharma, the chief technology officer, EtherealX is aiming to take on SpaceX with a medium-lift launch vehicle called Razor Crest Mk-1. The rocket, designed to be fully reusable, is expected to place up to eight tonnes into low Earth orbit and will also be capable of delivering payloads to geostationary transfer and trans-lunar injection orbits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-based startup says its launch system will offer cost efficiencies to customers while helping to address a global shortage of launch capacity, with a first launch targeted for early 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Nair said EtherealX’s rocket could offer launch prices ranging from about $350 to $2,000 per kilogram.

Its growing space tech ecosystem is also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/indias-digantara-raises-50m-for-space-based-missile-defence-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">attracting global investors</a> seeking markets that can complement space development in the United States, Europe, and other key regions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EtherealX has secured 16 acres of land in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which it plans to make operational early next year. The startup has also been developing key components, including a liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump assembly for its upper-stage engine, known as Pegasus 2.0, according to a recent LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7404121855927836673/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> by Nair.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is aiming to dramatically expand its footprint in the global commercial space industry, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-08/india-targets-45-billion-space-economy-driven-by-private-firms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">targeting an 8% to 10% market share</a> over the next decade from less than 2% today, with much of that growth expected to be driven by private startups.

But with the new AI models and advances in computer vision, its founders are confident the technology is ready for the masses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The duo is using their experience with self-driving cars to apply concepts of robotics perception and 3D vision for the 3D reconstruction of video in sports. This system can reduce the camera requirement from over 100 to as few as 32, helping decrease cost and operational overhead, according to Cui and Khan. The startup aims to keep the hardware cost as minimal as possible for teams and broadcasters and sign multi-year contracts for its platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software platform will bring biomechanical data of players and stats for teams and leagues using its own sensor stack, which is similar to the sensors on self-driving cars that capture the scene with depth. It will enable new ways to control the viewing of the play for broadcasters and fans using photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology. For instance, if fans wanted to track only the player with the ball, they could do that. They can also freeze a moment in-game to see different angles for a foul or a critical moment in play.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we work with off-the-shelf cameras, the way we package it with our experience in robotics and ML is what gives us an edge both in terms of platforms and also scaling from small practice enclosures to big soccer and football stadiums,” Cui said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the software side, the platform said it can observe different joints, including finger movements of players, to measure flexion. For instance, in the video above of two people playing football (soccer), the system measures flexion of knees and ankles. This could give coaches more ideas about body positioning and the flexibility of a player, and help them improve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has raised a $3.6 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Daybreak Capital, Entrepreneurs First, and Transpose Platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joe Ros, a partner at Entrepreneurs First, noted the fund was surprised by how big a following the founders and their autonomous driving team have at the University of Toronto. He noted investors are often hesitant to invest in sports-related startups, but Peripheral Labs is also an entertainment play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Their ultimate viewer is the consumer, and their demand for sports content is evergreen, not cyclical. With Peripheral, the new standard for that consumption will be immersive, volumetric video. And the work they’re doing now in sports will give them the data, tech, and deployment moat to be the only person in the market able to enable this,” he told TechCrunch over email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peripheral Labs said the startup was selective about the VCs they were bringing in, who could help in different areas like product development and go-to-market advice. The company has 10 engineers on its staff and aims to increase headcount with a focus on platform and hardware development to reduce costs for the company, decrease the latency of the system, and also increase the resolution of 3D reconstruction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup hasn’t made any public announcements about the partners it is working with, but said it is in conversation with several teams and leagues in North America. The company competes with other startups like <a href=\"https://arcturus.studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Arcturus Studios</a> in the volumetric capture for sports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These evenings offer a chance to step back from the blur of headlines and hype cycles, to sit with the people actually driving change, and to understand what’s really happening behind the scenes. They’ve been designed from the start as cocktail parties with killer content — we’ve always wanted these to be intimate gatherings where the conversation flows freely, and speakers can let their guard down in ways they simply can’t at larger, more formal conferences.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-full-2025-strictlyvc-recap\">The full 2025 StrictlyVC recap</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking back, 2025 was truly a blur of both insights and amazing connections. It’s almost hard to believe now how many stimulating conversations we were able to facilitate — from heads of state to startup founders, from crypto evangelists to defense tech pioneers. And each evening brought its own energy and revelations.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-it-started-san-francisco\">Where it started: San Francisco</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We kicked off this past year in San Francisco’s Presidio, where Kirsten Green of Forerunner Ventures co-hosted an unforgettable night. Green herself — an early investor in Chime, Oura, and countless other household brands — shared her excitement about the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/forerunners-long-game-as-startups-stall-before-ipo-all-options-are-on-the-table/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">white space</a> emerging at the intersection of AI and consumer tech. But she was just the beginning. We heard from Ethan Thornton of Mach Industries about the wild ride of building a defense tech startup in your twenties, complete with all the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/how-a-hydrogen-explosion-led-a-teenage-founder-to-become-sequoias-first-defense-tech-investment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">missteps</a> that come with the territory. Tarek Mansour of Kalshi captivated the room, explaining in his entertainingly blasé way why regulators <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/kalshi-ceo-state-law-doesnt-really-apply-to-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">don’t keep him up at night</a>, even as CEO of the industry’s hottest prediction market. Ryan Petersen of Flexport had plenty to say about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/07/flexport-ceo-ryan-petersens-high-stakes-test-amid-tariff-turmoil-you-cant-be-freaking-out/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trump’s tariff plans</a>.

(Rivian says the software will re-engage if a driver uses their turn signal and handles the turn manually.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an important step forward for the company, which is aiming to make its vehicles capable of full autonomy over the next few years. But it also comes with risk: Rival automakers with similar systems like Tesla and Ford have dealt with multiple crashes and deaths, many related to drivers’ attention straying from the driver assistance systems. Those crashes have led to investigations and lawsuits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated software greatly expands the driver assistance capabilities that were previously available to Rivian owners. Before the update, Rivian’s hands-free driving system only worked on 135,000 miles of highways. Rivian detailed plans at last week’s event to eventually allow its vehicles to drive themselves from “point-to-point,” though that feature will not ship until 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian is developing a new autonomy computer with custom silicon for its R2 SUV (which debuts in 2026) that, combined with a roof-mounted lidar sensor, will be capable of one day making the company’s vehicles fully autonomous, CEO RJ Scaringe said last week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software update released Thursday brings a few other features not related to Rivian’s driver assistance system. There’s a new version of its digital key that owners of second-generation R1 vehicles can add to digital wallets on iPhones, Apple Watches, Google Pixels, and Samsung phones. Owners of quad-motor variants of the Gen 2 R1 EVs are also getting the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/the-tech-behind-rivians-2026-quad-motor-truck-and-suv-and-that-kick-turn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">long-teased “Kick Turn” feature</a>, as well as the “RAD Tuner” customizable drive modes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The iPhone maker is not making these changes because it wants to be more open; it’s being forced — in this case, to comply with the country’s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which is now going into effect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/app-distribution-in-japan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">this update</a>, Apple’s App Store revenues are being impacted in another major market due to anticompetition laws and regulations. The company already has to comply with Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which previously required the tech giant to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">allow for alternative app stores</a> and other changes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the U.S., Apple has been strong-armed into changing its in-payments system <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-just-scored-a-major-win-against-apple/\">by way of the courts</a>, after a lawsuit from Fortnite maker, Epic Games. Though it was not declared a monopoly, the court decided Apple needed to give developers the right to process payments outside of its system if they chose. (The specifics around that order are still being worked out after an appeal <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-appeals-court-partly-reverses-sanctions-against-apple-epic-games-antitrust-2025-12-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partially reversed an earlier ruling.</a>)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As usual, in its announcement about the changes in Japan, Apple warned that alternative app marketplaces and payments open “new avenues for malware, fraud, scams, and privacy and security risks.” To mitigate those risks, the company said it worked with Japanese regulators to require an authorization process for app marketplaces (“Notarization”), which it says is designed to protect children specifically from inappropriate content and scams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that Apple has come up with a process to dial back the risk for alternative app stores indicates there has always been a technical solution at hand to balance the needs for both openness and security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As in the EU, Apple has come up with a complex fee structure to ensure it doesn’t lose much in the form of App Store revenue, while seemingly complying with the letter of the law.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077346\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg 1770w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=1200,791 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=1280,843 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=430,283 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=720,474 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=900,593 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=800,527 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1012 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=668,440 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=569,375 569w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=937,617 937w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=708,466 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple / screenshot by TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, of course, was not silent on this matter, saying Fortnite will still not return to iOS in Japan because Apple is charging a 21% fee on third-party in-app purchases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2001494517996732598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In a post on X, he wrote</a>, “Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.

Users can also provide a start and an end frame to guide the model to generate transitional footage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said Thursday the Ray3 Modify model solves the problems of preserving human performance while editing or generating effects using AI for creative studios. The startup said the model follows the input footage better, allowing studios to use human actors for creative or brand footage. Luma mentioned the new model retains the actor’s original motion, timing, eye line, and emotional delivery while transforming the scene.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Ray3 Modify, users can provide a character reference for transformation to the original footage and convert the human actor’s appearance into that character. This reference also allows creators to retain information like costumes, likeness, and identity across the shoot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, users can also provide start and end reference frames to create a video using the new Ray3 Modify model. This is helpful for creators in directing transitions or controlling character movements or behavior while maintaining continuity between scenes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Luma AI - Introducing Ray3 Modify\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s-wRxtSKC0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Generative video models are incredibly expressive but also hard to control. Today, we are excited to introduce Ray3 Modify that blends the real-world with the expressivity of AI while giving full control to creatives. This means creative teams can capture performances with a camera and then immediately modify them to be in any location imaginable, change costumes, or even go back and reshoot the scene with AI, without recreating the physical shoot,” Amit Jain, co-founder and CEO of Luma AI, said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luma said the new model is available to users through the company’s Dream Machine platform. The company, which competes with the likes of Runway and Kling, released <a href=\"https://lumalabs.ai/blog/news/introducing-modify-video?utm_source=alphasignal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">video modification capabilities</a> in June 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The model release comes on the back of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/19/luma-ai-raises-900-million-in-funding-led-by-saudi-ai-firm-humain.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a fresh $900 million funding round</a>, led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, for the startup announced in November.

The company launched in 2024, and has grown blazing fast: It reached the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/eight-months-in-swedish-unicorn-lovable-crosses-the-100m-arr-milestone/\">vaunted $100 million ARR milestone</a> within eight months, and just four months later, doubled that to surpass <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/as-lovable-hits-200m-arr-its-ceo-credits-staying-in-europe-for-its-success/\">$200 million in annual recurring revenue</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company counts major software names like Klarna, Uber, and Zendesk as customers, and claims that more than 100,000 new projects are built on its platform every day, and more than 25 million projects were created in its first year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovable said it would use the new funding for building deeper integrations with third-party apps, expanding its features for enterprise use-cases, and to flesh out its platform with the infrastructure needed — like databases, payments, and hosting — to build full-fledged applications and services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovable co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said onstage at this year’s Slush conference in Helsinki, Finland that he credits the company’s ability to scale to his decision to ignore calls from investors to relocate the company to Silicon Valley.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said onstage at the November conference. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘Look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country.’ There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, the company was called out for not paying VAT, a tax that applies to most goods and services in the European Union (EU). Osika confirmed that this was true in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antonosika_lovable-just-got-called-out-for-not-paying-activity-7399176055850364928-Yq78/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn post</a>, saying that the company would remedy the situation, and shut down comments saying taxes like this are why the EU isn’t a good home for high-growth startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vibe coding continues to be a hot area of investing for VCs. Cursor, another vibe-coding darling, raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/coding-assistant-cursor-raises-2-3b-5-months-after-its-previous-round/\">$2.3 billion in November</a> at a $29.3 billion valuation. Like Lovable, this was also the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">company’s second funding round</a> of the year, seeing its valuation double between June and November.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch reached out to Lovable for any additional information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For example, if the system sees a person in a delivery uniform dropping off a package, it will respond based on your instructions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature adds settings that let you specify where delivery people can leave packages, and direct them toward water or snacks you might have kept out. If a delivery person needs a signature, Alexa can also ask them when they might return, and pass that message to the user.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It can also handle sales reps or service vendors. You can set an instruction such as “If someone comes to the door trying to sell something, politely let them know we’re not interested.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And if you’re busy or not home, Alexa can greet friends or family when they visit, and ask them to leave a message for you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It goes without saying that the tech presents the risk of misidentifying people and responding inappropriately — if, for example, a friend works in logistics and comes to see you after work in their delivery uniform, Ring may, via Alexa, ask them to leave a package somewhere instead of letting them leave a message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature follows a controversial facial recognition feature for Ring called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">“Familiar Faces”</a> that lets you create a catalog of the faces of up to 50 people who visit you regularly. Once labeled, these people will be named in the Ring app’s timeline and notifications when they visit. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says Greetings uses Ring’s video descriptions to determine who the main subject in front of the camera is for generating responses, and it doesn’t identify who the person is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is compatible with Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd Gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd Gen) and is available to users on the Ring Premium Plan who have enabled video descriptions. It is rolling out to Alexa+ Early access customers in the U.S. and Canada.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Put another way, the agency wants to know why some people are paying substantially more for their organic granola than others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue came to light after a study revealed that shoppers are seeing fairly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/study-shows-instacart-may-be-charging-some-shoppers-20-more-for-the-same-product/\">different prices</a> for identical groceries from the same stores — up to 23% higher prices in some cases. Instacart says these price tests were randomized, not tied to an algorithm that targets customers based on their browsing history. But when people are already anxious about affording eggs, that distinction probably doesn’t mean much.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dynamic pricing isn’t new or necessarily nefarious. Harvard Business School will tell you it’s how digital platforms stay competitive. Airlines use it, hotels use it, Uber famously uses it. Companies argue that it helps balance supply and demand, maximizes profitability, and creates win-win scenarios.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there’s a difference between paying surge pricing for a ride home from the bar and paying extra for groceries (food isn’t optional). So while the investigation doesn’t prove wrongdoing, it’s hardly shocking that the FTC — which has investigated data-driven <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-ftc-looking-into-targeted-pricing-based-personal-data-2024-07-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pricing strategies</a> by other companies — is reportedly asking questions. In an economy where everyone’s feeling squeezed, AI-driven price testing of kitchen essentials was bound to attract attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For its part, Instacart says the market misunderstands this particular initiative. “Much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,” a spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch. “First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing — prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores.” <br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The software firm has launched a number of different AI services since 2023, including<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/adobe-firefly-now-supports-prompt-based-video-editing-adds-more-third-party-models/\"> Firefly</a> — its AI-powered media-generation suite. Now, however, the company’s full-throated embrace of the technology may have led to trouble, as a new lawsuit claims it used pirated books to train one of its AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Elizabeth Lyon, an author from Oregon, claims that Adobe used pirated versions of numerous books — including her own — to train the company’s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09944v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SlimLM program</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe describes SlimLM as a small language model series that can be “optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices.” It<a href=\"https://research.adobe.com/publication/slimlm-an-efficient-small-language-model-for-on-device-document-assistance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> states that</a> SlimLM was pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B, a “deduplicated, multi-corpora, open-source dataset”<a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/blog/slimpajama-a-627b-token-cleaned-and-deduplicated-version-of-redpajama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> released by Cerebras</a> in June of 2023. Lyon, who has written a number of guidebooks for non-fiction writing, says that some of her works were included in a pretraining dataset that Adobe had used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyon’s lawsuit, which was<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/adobe-sued-allegedly-misusing-authors-work-ai-training-2025-12-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> originally reported</a> on by Reuters, says that her writing was included in a processed subset of a manipulated dataset that was the basis of Adobe’s program: “The SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3),” the lawsuit says. “Thus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Books3” — a huge <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/books3-database-generative-ai-training-copyright-infringement/675363/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">collection of 191,000 books</a> that have been used to train GenAI systems — has been an ongoing source of legal trouble for the tech community. RedPajama has also been cited in a number of litigation cases. In September, <a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-faces-lawsuit-over-use-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a lawsuit </a>against Apple claimed the company had used copyrighted material to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-sued-over-use-copyrighted-books-train-apple-intelligence-2025-10-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">train its Apple Intelligence model</a>. The litigation mentioned the dataset and accused the tech company of copying protected works “without consent and without credit or compensation.” In October, a similar lawsuit against Salesforce<a href=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/salesforce-used-pirated-books-to-train-9970854/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> also</a> claimed the company had used RedPajama for training purposes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately for the tech industry, such lawsuits have, by now, become somewhat commonplace. AI algorithms are trained on massive datasets and, in some cases, those datasets have allegedly included pirated materials. In September, Anthropic<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/g-s1-87367/anthropic-authors-settlement-pirated-chatbot-training-material\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> agreed to pay $1.5 billion</a> to a number of authors who had sued it and accused it of using pirated versions of their work to train its chatbot, Claude. The case was considered a potential turning point in the ongoing legal battles over copyrighted material in AI training data, of which there are many.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
