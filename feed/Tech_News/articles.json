During its 12 years as a private business, the one-time tech darling raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/21/eventbrite-is-reportedly-going-public-in-the-second-half-of-this-year/\">approximately $330 million</a> in venture capital from top investors such as Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike traditional private equity firms, Bending Spoons buys companies that it intends to hold forever, aiming to turn them profitable by cutting costs, raising prices, and introducing new product features. In October, Bending Spoons announced a massive $270 million funding round that valued the company at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/what-is-bending-spoons-everything-to-know-about-aols-acquirer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$11 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides Bending Spoons, other investors follow the strategy of acquiring, fixing, and holding stalled software firms, often referred to as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/why-hold-forever-investors-are-snapping-up-venture-capital-zombies/\">“venture zombie”</a> companies. These firms include Constellation Software, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.curiousholdings.com/\">Curious</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/ZLRLCzq8n8Hwl0OycKsOC9mENB?domain=tiny.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tiny</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/P_YLCKAo6ofMgjZYckS6C5Qqog?domain=saas.group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SaaS.group</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/sFSTCA8LmLhlyvGPsQtyCGW8vh?domain=arisingventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Arising Ventures</a>, and <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/qTZzCB1MnMHRQgzks1u9C2N0yT?domain=calmcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Calm Capital</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, told TechCrunch that the firm buys “great companies” at low prices and quickly revives them to achieve <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/why-hold-forever-investors-are-snapping-up-venture-capital-zombies/\">20% to 30% profit margins</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Audited annual revenue was flat at about $325 million for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. Bending Spoons has agreed to pay approximately 1.7 times Eventbrite’s trailing twelve months revenue of $295 million. Despite this seemingly low revenue multiple, Eventbrite stockholders will receive $4.50 in cash per share, an 81% premium over the previous day’s $2.48 closing price.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Additionally, future growth is expected to come from various companies using Kalshi to hedge against business-specific risks, such as government shutdowns or adverse weather changes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Polymarket, Kalshi’s main rival, was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/polymarket-is-seeking-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-15-billion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in talks</a> to raise another round at a $12 billion to $15 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported in October.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

That means that users who are provided with the now common AI-generated snapshot of key information on a topic or question above their search results can choose to go deeper by asking follow-up questions in a conversational interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google calls this conversational feature <a href=\"https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Mode</a>. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-ai-mode-rolls-out-to-us-will-add-support-for-deeper-research-comparison-shopping-and-more/\">launched to U.S. users this May</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/googles-ai-mode-expands-globally-adds-new-agentic-features/\">to global users this August,</a> allowing for back-and-forth chats with Google’s Gemini AI, in an experience similar to ChatGPT.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more. You may have thought you were starting a simple query, only to find yourself delving deeper into the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new test, announced on Monday, Google says users will be able to “seamlessly go deeper” in AI Mode directly from the Search results page. While the test is rolling out to users globally, it’s only available on mobile devices for the time being. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rollout comes alongside a push inside Google’s AI rival, OpenAI, which is now delaying other products to focus on improving the chatbox experience. Thanks in part to the release of Gemini’s Nano Banana image model and other Gemini improvements, Gemini has grown <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to over 650 million monthly users</a> as of November. Merging the conversational mode with AI Overviews, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\">has 2 billion monthly users</a>, could give Gemini an edge in consumer adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notes VP of Product for Google Search Robby Stein, <a href=\"https://x.com/rmstein/status/1995572911093289055\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a post on X</a>, “You shouldn’t have to think about where or how to ask your question.” Instead, he explained, users will continue to get an AI Overview as a helpful starting point, but will then be able to ask conversational follow-up questions in AI Mode from the same screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This brings us closer to our vision for Search: just ask whatever’s on your mind – no matter how long or complex – and find exactly what you need,” Stein wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Preview versions of the agents are available now.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called “Kiro autonomous agent” can work on its own for days at a time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kiro is a software coding agent based on AWS’s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced in July.</a> While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company’s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called “spec-driven development.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,” AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says Kiro maintains “persistent context across sessions.” In other words, it doesn’t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do.  It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garman described a task like updating a bit of critical code used by 15 bits of corporate software. Instead of assigning and verifying each update, Kiro can be assigned to fix all 15 in one prompt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To complete the automation of coding tasks, the cloud provider developed AWS Security Agent, an agent that works independently to identify security problems as code is written, tests it after the fact, and then offers suggested fixes. The DevOps Agent rounds out the trio, automatically testing the new code for performance issues, or compatibility with other software, hardware, or cloud settings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be sure, Amazon’s agents aren’t the first to claim long work windows. For instance OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-codex-max/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said last month </a>that GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, its agentic coding model, is designed for long runs, too, up to 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also not totally clear that the biggest hurdle to agentic adoption is the context window (aka the ability to work continuously without stalling out). LLMs still have hallucination and accuracy issues that turn developers into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">“babysitters,” they say.</a>  So developers often want to assign short tasks and verify quickly before moving on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, before agents can become like co-workers, context windows must grow bigger. Amazon’s tech is another big step in that direction. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: Every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but also exceedingly important in this moment. There is also growing competition <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/what-is-substrate-a-thiel-backed-chip-startup-seeking-to-crack-asml-s-dominance?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">chasing after the same prize</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mina-fahmi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mina Fahmi</a>, who’s made a ring that captures your whispered thoughts and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">turns them into text</a>. Before you roll your eyes, know that he and co-founder Kirak Hong spent years at Meta working on this stuff after their company was acquired. The Stream Ring isn’t trying to be your friend — it’s trying to extend your brain. Backed by Toni Schneider, an operator who scaled WordPress in its earlier days, Sandbar just emerged from stealth and might well be onto something. (Schneider is a partner at True Ventures, whose other hardware bets have included Peloton, Ring, and Fitbit; he’s also coming to Palo Alto next week.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sciencecorporation_bringing-sight-to-the-blind-with-neural-engineering-activity-7292950930352726016-YI6a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Max Hodak</a> — Science Corp. founder, Time magazine <a href=\"https://time.com/7308925/elon-musk-memphis-ai-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cover subject</a>, and, earlier, Neuralink co-founder (along with Elon Musk) — who has already restored vision to dozens of blind people with retinal implants. Now he’s working on “biohybrid” brain-computer interfaces where chips seeded with stem cells grow into your brain tissue so paralyzed people can control devices with their thoughts. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, as Hodak views it. In fact, he thinks 2035 is going to look wildly different from today, and he’s happy to share how.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, we’re thrilled to welcome <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chchien\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chi-Hua Chien</a> of Goodwater Capital and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethweil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elizabeth Weil</a> of Scribble Ventures, two VCs who’ve backed Twitter, Spotify, TikTok, Slack, SpaceX, Figma, and Coinbase before they were household names.

Before his trip, Johnson and his Blueprint co-founder, Kate Tolo, joked they could make this stream like the Super Bowl and sell commercials. What was once a rite of passage for a certain ilk of college kids — listening to music and getting too high — was being turned into a very public, yet remarkably uncool, experiment on stretching the bounds of humanity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over a million people viewed the livestream on X, either in real time or as a replay. As Johnson ingested the shrooms and used his own technology from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/bryan-johnson-invests-100-million-in-kernel-to-unlock-the-power-of-the-human-brain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kernel</a> — a giant black helmet — to monitor his body’s reaction, a cadre of commentators with a collective net worth upward of $10 billion joined the video feed to heap praise upon Johnson for bravely tripping balls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some people see Johnson’s methods as elaborate, vampiric performance art, his Silicon Valley contemporaries think he’s a visionary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marc Benioff, founder and CEO of Salesforce, spoke about the parallels he sees between Johnson and the biblical Jacob.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My Bible study this morning was on Jacob’s Ladder … Jacob ends up with this incredible experience where he’s able to talk to God, and he’s climbing the ladder and coming back down, and finding the land he was in as holy,” Benioff said on the stream. “We’re still trying to find those bridges, and I think that’s what Bryan’s trying to do … He’s not doing this for recreational purposes, I would say.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071942\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png 3446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=1280,722 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=1536,867 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=1094,617 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.11-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Byran Johnson's livestream on X</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Naval Ravikant, the renowned investor and founder of AngelList, described Johnson as a “one-man FDA,” complaining that scientific advancement does not move forward as quickly as he would like due to regulators and bioethicists. It’s reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">manifesto</a> Marc Andreessen published two years ago, in which he decries “social responsibility” and “tech ethics” as enemies to innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Bryan’s] just like screw it, I’ll do it myself, and I’ll legitimize it, I’ll popularize it, I’ll experiment with it, and I’m gonna blaze the trail,” Ravikant said. “I hope he survives for a long time and then gives us the cheat codes. That’s really what we want. There should be a thousand Bryans, ten thousand Bryans out there doing this.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Johnson was not privy to this lavish praise — he had put on an eye mask and swaddled himself in a weighted blanket, oblivious to the proceedings of the five-hour livestream he had planned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it was a bit of a burden to have a microphone and have to be concentrating on what he wanted to say on a livestream,” explained Ashlee Vance, a journalist who has been chronicling Johnson’s pursuit to conquer death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The purpose of Johnson’s public, meticulously measured shrooms trip is to research the potential for the use of psychedelics in life extension — research that academics are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">already working on</a> in peer-reviewed studies. He’s far from the first to approach hallucinogens as a therapeutic intervention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the 1960s, Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary helped accelerate the movement to adopt psychedelics as mind-expanding tools, even sharing an interest in the same themes that captivate today’s tech elite: space migration, intelligence increase, and life extension, which Leary abbreviated as “SMI²LE.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Leary’s era, psychedelics were the focal point of a broader cultural movement that emphasized expanding the mind for the sake of music and art — he had a personal relationship with artists and writers like Allen Ginsberg, Ken Kesey, and the Grateful Dead (then called the Warlocks). <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/11/nyregion/ken-kesey-author-of-cuckoo-s-nest-who-defined-the-psychedelic-era-dies-at-66.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kesey,</a> who has said he volunteered to participate in experiments involving LSD and other psychedelic drugs, was a key influencer of the psychedelic era, whose exploits were documented in Tom Wolfe’s “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.” Even John Lennon first wrote “Come Together” as a campaign song for Leary’s political aspirations, but Leary never did run for office — instead, the song served as the opener for “Abbey Road,” one of the most iconic albums of the decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two generations later, Johnson is gearing up to take shrooms on a livestream as he tries to explain a concept he calls “longevity escape velocity,” the point at which humans would no longer have to age.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Time passes, but you stay the same age biologically,” Johnson said. “So that would be probably the most significant accomplishment for humans.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AKA, we’re going to try to make Bryan Johnson immortal, effectively, by 2039,” explained Tolo, who sat with Johnson through the duration of the stream.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So we’re basically doing this protocol and sharing it with all of you, for free, of how can we all do this together?” Johnson said. “So psilocybin is part of that journey where we’re trying to say, what therapies in the world could actually help us slow down our speed of aging, and reverse aging damage?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Johnson and Tolo portray this shrooms trip as a groundbreaking moment in the quest for immortality. The backdrop isn’t a dimly lit and smoke-filled room festooned with psychedelic colors and music, nor is it a university research lab. Instead, it could be another corporate Zoom meeting with the addition of Johnson wrapped in a weighted blanket and eye mask, happily divorced from responsibility. Looking fondly at Johnson in his cozy cocoon, Benioff remarked, “I think we’re missing a really great opportunity for a sponsorship with a sleep mask company.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071940\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png 3450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=1280,722 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=1094,617 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-1.31.36-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Byran Johnson's livestream on X</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, Johnson is roused from his swaddle, and Tolo struggles to collect his requisite saliva samples, then places a large black helmet on his head, which records his brain activity while he stares at a wall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Welcome to Johnson’s longevity revolution, which plays out in a beige room with beige furniture, equipped with laptops and tools for monitoring his biometrics, while some of the richest and most powerful in tech watch along.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A new “Notification organizer” will automatically group and silence lower-priority notifications, such as promotions, news, and social alerts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The update also brings more ways to customize devices, with users getting access to custom icon shapes, themed icons, and the option to automatically darken light apps, even those that don’t have their own native dark theme.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, there’s a new Parental Controls option within Android Settings that allows parents to set screen time limits, create downtime schedules, control app usage, and more for their children.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071853\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png 2128w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=768,586 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=680,519 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=1200,916 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=1280,977 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=430,328 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=720,549 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=900,687 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=800,611 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=1536,1172 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=2048,1563 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=668,510 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=491,375 491w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=808,617 808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=696,531 696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-12.51.39-PM.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These updates are starting to roll out with Android 16 on eligible Pixel devices starting Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also releasing several new Android features that aren’t specific to Android 16. A new beta feature called “Call Reason” allows users to flag calls to saved contacts as “urgent.” Recipients will see this on their incoming call screen and know it’s time-sensitive. If they miss the call, the “urgent” note will stay in their call history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also launching “Expressive Captions” that display the full emotion of speech with tags like [sad] or [joyful], whether it’s a video message or a post on social media. The company says this will allow users to glean the full context of what’s being said when the sound is off.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant is making it easier to spot and exit unwanted group chats. If an unknown number invites a user to a group, they’ll get an alert that shows key information about the group. The user can then quickly choose to reply, leave the chat, or block and report the number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Pinned tabs in Chrome now work the same way as on desktop, which means pinned pages stay saved at the front of the browser, letting users pick up where they left off.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071855\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-Expressive-Captions.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also updating Circle to Search, its feature that allows users to search from anywhere on their phone by using gestures like circling, highlighting, scribbling, or tapping. Users can now analyze suspicious messages with the feature — after initiating Circle to Search, an AI Overview will appear indicating whether the message is likely a scam.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For accessibility updates, Google is enhancing its “Guided Frame” feature in the Pixel camera app. Previously, the feature has notified users about things like a face in the frame. Now, it will provide a more in-depth description, such as “one girl with a yellow T-shirt sits on the sofa and looks at the dog.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, users no longer need to physically tap their phone to start using Voice Access, which allows users to control their Android devices with voice commands. Now, users just need to say “Hey Google, start Voice Access” to begin controlling their phone hands-free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also launching Fast Pair for hearing aids, starting with hearing aids from Demant, a Danish company that owns several major hearing aid brands, including Oticon, Sonic, and Bernafon.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s important to note that the game does not feature a multiplayer mode and players must be connected to the internet to play; offline gameplay is not available.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Originally released by Rockstar Games in 2010, Red Dead Redemption is set in the year 1911 during the Wild West era. Players assume the role of John Marston, a former outlaw searching for his kidnapped family. The mobile version includes the stand-alone expansion pack, “Undead Nightmare,” which follows Marston as he faces a zombie outbreak.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxzVIKskNOY?si=uY3wrU8V7oUN1k7Q\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The inclusion of Red Dead Redemption in Netflix’s gaming lineup is a significant addition to its gaming strategy, especially considering that Netflix has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/08/netflix-mobile-games-report-apptopia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">faced challenges</a> in previous years with fewer than 1% of its subscriber base engaging with the available games. The company’s investment in the space finally showed signs of growth in 2024, when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/netflix-games-gain-traction-with-installs-up-180-year-over-year-in-2023-thanks-to-gta-and-others/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">estimates</a> revealed that Netflix Games downloads increased 180% year-over-year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Red Dead Redemption is one of Rockstar’s most popular franchises, second only to the iconic Grand Theft Auto series. The game has attracted a dedicated base, and some players have been speculating that a prequel might be announced soon. The newly launched mobile game could potentially generate renewed interest in the franchise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch comes on the heels of Netflix’s introduction of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/netflix-is-letting-users-play-games-on-their-tv-screens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">games on smart TVs</a> in October.

This year, Amazon’s share of ChatGPT referrals grew to 54%, up from 40.5% in 2024. Walmart’s share, meanwhile, increased from 2.7% last year to now 14.9%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The data was collected by Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which is based on observed consumer activity on mobile devices. As it’s not first-party data, its figures are only estimates. For this analysis, the firm defined a referral session as a retail mobile app session that directly followed (within 30 seconds) a ChatGPT session.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the big jump from 2024, consumers’ use of AI chatbots to find e-commerce deals is still a small sliver of the overall referral market, Apptopia noted. Last year, ChatGPT’s referrals to e-commerce apps were only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday, and that figure only grew to 0.82% this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this case, a referral session was anytime ChatGPT either gave the searcher a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from their chat session that brought them to the retail app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apptopia isn’t the only firm digging into how AI is impacting e-commerce during the busy holiday shopping season. Adobe also reported this week that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday, and those who landed on a retail site from an AI chatbot were 38% more likely to make a purchase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Adobe said that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites on Cyber Monday increased by 670%. In the holiday shopping season so far (November 1 to December 1), AI traffic is up 760%, it noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NE-3tFhvf9c?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flags</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At the time, the company released four text-generating models and one image-generating model. This year, AWS is giving the models an upgrade and launching an accompanying service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The momentum has been really fantastic,” Garman said during his Tuesday keynote. “Nova has been, has grown to be used by tens of thousands of customers today, everyone from marketing giants to tech leaders like Infosys or Blue Origin or Robinhood to innovative startups like NinjaTech AI and today, we’re making Nova even better.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The four new models include Nova 2 Lite, a more cost-effective reasoning model. Reasoning AI models “think” before they respond and can process text, images, and videos to generate text that’s meant for everyday tasks. Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning agent that can process text, images, videos and speech that is designed for “highly complex tasks” like coding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nova 2 Sonic is a new speech-to-speech model to be used for conversational AI. Nova 2 Omni is a multimodal reasoning and generation model that can process images, text, video and speech input, and produce both text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the model upgrades, AWS also announced a new service called Nova Forge which allows AWS cloud customers to build their own frontier version of AWS Nova models called Novellas for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/02/amazon-nova-forge-lets-clients-customize-ai-models-for-100000-a-year.html\">$100,000 a year</a>, according to CNBC reporting. This service allows enterprises to access pre-trained, mid-trained or post-trained models for companies to then train on their own proprietary data.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garman said this will be able to solve some of the problems that arise when enterprises try to incorporate their own data into already-trained AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The more you customize models, the more you add a bunch of data in post training, these models tend to forget some of that interesting stuff that it learned earlier the core reasoning,” Garman said. “It’s a little bit like humans trying to learn new language. When you start when you’re really young, it’s actually relatively easy to pick up, but when you try to, you learn a new language later in life, it’s actually much, much harder. Model training is kind of like this too.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies including Reddit, Sony and Booking.com are early Nova Forge customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\">annual enterprise tech event here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ojyZCM6qk?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

OpenAI, however, clarified that the app suggestion was not an advertisement, but instead a poor attempt to integrate an app discovery feature within conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1995357492713570735\">a post on X</a>, which has since been viewed nearly 462,000 times, AI startup Hyperbolic’s co-founder, Yuchen Jin, shared a screenshot where ChatGPT seemingly suggested connecting the Peloton app in an unrelated conversation. Worse still, Jin noted he was a paid subscriber to ChatGPT’s $200 per month Pro Plan. At that price point, ads would not be expected.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The post, which was <a href=\"https://x.com/_dmca/status/1995572734617939973?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reshared</a> and saved hundreds of times across X, received quite a bit of attention, as it seemed to indicate OpenAI was testing the insertion of ads into its paid product. Users complained that paying customers, especially, shouldn’t have to see app suggestions like this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/dgrreen/status/1995594572488233020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">One person also pointed out</a> that they couldn’t get ChatGPT to stop recommending Spotify to them, even though they were an Apple Music subscriber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s data lead for ChatGPT, Daniel McAuley, <a href=\"https://x.com/_dmca/status/1995572734617939973?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">later jumped into the thread</a> to clarify that the Peloton placement was not an ad; it was “only a suggestion to install Peloton’s app.” He said there was “no financial component” to the appearance of the app suggestion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he admitted that “the lack of relevancy” to the conversation made it a bad and confusing experience, and OpenAI was iterating on the suggestions and the user experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A company spokesperson also confirmed to TechCrunch that what users had spotted was one of the ways OpenAI had been “testing surfacing apps in ChatGPT conversations.” They pointed to <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI’s announcement in October</a> about its new app platform, where the company noted that apps would “fit naturally” into user conversations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can discover [apps] when ChatGPT suggests one at the right time, or by calling them by name. Apps respond to natural language and include interactive interfaces you can use right in the chat,” the post explained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that didn’t appear to be the case here, as the user claims they weren’t discussing anything related to health and fitness. Instead, as the screenshot shows, they had been chatting with the AI about a podcast featuring Elon Musk, where xAI was the topic being discussed. Inserting Peloton into this experience was unhelpful and a distraction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet even if the app suggestion had been relevant, users may have still viewed it as an ad, given that it’s directing people to a product from a business that isn’t free. In addition, users can’t turn off these app suggestions, which may make them feel more intrusive.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This user sentiment could have potential ramifications for OpenAI’s desire to replace the App Store experience, and apps that run on your phone, with integrated apps that run within ChatGPT. If users don’t want to see app suggestions, they could choose to switch to a competitor’s chatbot to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, ChatGPT apps are available to logged-in users outside of the EU, Switzerland, and the U.K., and the integrations are still in pilot testing. OpenAI partners with a number of app makers, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Zillow, and others. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We asked Taylor if the company had received any communication from the hackers, such as a demand for money, along with other specific questions about the breach, including whether Mixpanel employee accounts were protected with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#multi-factor-authentication\">multi-factor authentication</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of its affected customers is OpenAI, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/mixpanel-incident/\">published its own blog post</a> two days later, confirming what Mixpanel had failed to explicitly say in its own post, that customer data had been taken from Mixpanel’s systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said it was affected by the breach because it relied on software provided by Mixpanel to help understand how OpenAI users interact with certain parts of its website, such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview\">its developer documentation</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI users affected by the Mixpanel breach are likely to be developers whose own apps or websites rely on OpenAI’s products to work. OpenAI said its stolen data included the user’s provided name, email addresses, their approximate location (such as city and state) based on their IP address, and some identifiable device data, such as the operating system and browser version. Some of this information is the same kind of data that Mixpanel collects from people’s devices as they use apps and browse websites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For its part, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix told TechCrunch that the breached data taken from Mixpanel “did not contain identifiers such as Android advertising ID or Apple’s IDFA,” which may have made it easier to personally identify specific OpenAI users or combine their OpenAI activity with usage from other apps and websites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said in its blog post that the incident did not affect ChatGPT users directly and terminated its use of Mixpanel as a result of the breach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While details of the breach remain limited, this incident draws fresh scrutiny of the data analytics industry, which profits from collecting reams of information about how people use websites and apps. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-mixpanel-tracks-taps-clicks-and-watches-your-screen-nbsp\">How Mixpanel tracks taps, clicks, and watches your screen<strong> </strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mixpanel is one of the largest web and mobile analytics companies that you might have never heard of, unless you work in the app development or marketing space. According to its website, Mixpanel has 8,000 corporate customers — one less now, following OpenAI’s early exit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With each Mixpanel customer having potentially millions of users of their own, the number of ordinary people whose data was taken in the breach could be significant. The type of breached data is likely to vary by each Mixpanel customer, depending on how each customer configured their data collection and how much user data they collected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies like Mixpanel are part of a booming industry providing tracking technologies that allow companies to understand how their customers and users interact with their apps and websites. As such, analytics companies can collect and store vast amounts of information, including billions of data points, about regular consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, an app maker or website developer can embed a piece of code from an analytics company like Mixpanel inside their app or website to gain that visibility. For the app user or website visitor, it’s like having someone watch over your shoulder without your knowledge as you browse a website or use an app, while it constantly shares every click or tap, swipe, and link press with the company that develops the app or website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Mixpanel’s case, it’s easy to see the types of data that Mixpanel collects from the apps and websites that its code is embedded in. Using open source tools like Burp Suite, TechCrunch analyzed the network traffic flowing in and out of several apps with Mixpanel code inside — such as Imgur, Lingvano, Neon, and Park Mobile. In our various tests, we saw varying degrees of information about our device and in-app activity uploaded to Mixpanel while using the apps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This data can include the person’s activity, such as opening the app, tapping a link, swiping a page, or signing in with their username and password, for example. This event logging data is then attached to information about the user and their device, including the device type (such as iPhone or Android), the screen width and height, if the user is on the phone network or Wi-Fi, the user’s cell network carrier, the logged-in user’s unique identifier for that service (which can be tied to the app user), and the precise timestamp for that event. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The collected data can sometimes include information that should be off-limits. Mixpanel <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/mixpanel-passwords/\">admitted in 2018 that its analytics code</a> inadvertently collected users’ passwords.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data collected by analytics companies is meant to be pseudonymized — essentially scrambled in a way that it doesn’t include identifiable details, such as a person’s name. Instead, the collected information is attributed to a unique but seemingly random identifier that’s used in place of a person’s name; an ostensibly more privacy-preserving way of storing the data. But pseudonymized data <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/07/no-hashing-still-doesnt-make-your-data-anonymous\">can be reversed and used to identify people’s real-world identities</a>. And, data collected about a person’s device can be used to uniquely identify that device, known as “fingerprinting,” which can also be used to track that user’s activity across different apps and across the internet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By tracking what you do on your device across various apps, analytics companies make it easier for their customers to build up profiles of users and their activity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mixpanel also allows its customers to collect “session replays,” which visually reconstruct how the company’s users interact with an app or website so that the developer can identify bugs and problems. Session replays are meant to exclude personally identifiable or sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, from any collected user session, but this process isn’t perfect, either. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Mixpanel’s own admission, session replays can sometimes <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/session-replay\">include sensitive information</a> that should not have been logged, but are collected inadvertently. Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/apple-glassbox-apps/\">cracked down</a> on apps that use screen recording code after TechCrunch exposed the practice in 2019.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To say that Mixpanel has questions to answer about its breach is perhaps an understatement. Without knowing the specific types of data involved, it’s not clear how big a breach this is or how many people might be affected. It may be that Mixpanel doesn’t yet know. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What is clear is that companies like Mixpanel store huge banks of information about people and how they use their apps, and are clearly becoming a focus for malicious hackers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Do you know more about the Mixpanel data breach?

The new “ultra-fast” delivery option will allow Amazon to better compete with services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Instacart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customers will be able to order a range of different items, including milk, eggs, fresh produce, toothpaste, cosmetics, pet treats, diapers, paper products, electronics, seasonal items, over-the-counter medicines, chips, dips, and more, according to the company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prime members can choose the fast delivery option for a $3.99 fee per order, while non-Prime members will have to pay $13.99.

So it’s more capable of doing, repeating whatever human activities in the digital world,” co-founder CEO Ang Li told TechCrunch, offering the example of copying and pasting data into a spreadsheet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday it announced the release of its 1.0 version for Mac OS. But it’s also working with Microsoft to develop an agent for Windows. The startup is one of five agentic companies accepted into the Windows 365 for Agents program <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/windows-365-for-agents-unlocks-secured-scalable-ai-automation/4468107\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Microsoft announced in mid November.</a> (The others are Manus AI, Fellou, Genspark, and TinyFish.) As for the timeline for the Windows version, Li was vague except to say it promises to be as or more popular than the Mac version. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another reason to watch Simular is the bona fides of the founders: Li is a continuous learning scientist who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, where he met his co-founder, reinforcement learning specialist Jiachen Yang. While their team published their fair share of papers, the work wasn’t strictly academic, Li said. It was intended to improve Google products, including Waymo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That AI product background is helpful because, before the agentic future of Silicon Valley’s dreams can materialize, there are a host of technical problems to solve. One of the biggest is that LLMs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\">hallucinate</a> some percentage of the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agentic tasks can require completing thousands to millions of discrete steps. Not only can a hallucination at any single step invalidate all of the agent’s work, but hallucinations become statistically more likely as the number of steps grows.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One way to solve this is to make the “non deterministic” LLM “deterministic,” meaning instead of allowing the LLM to be endlessly creative, its responses or actions are scripted the same each time. But that risks limiting the whole creative problem-solving aspect of an agent.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Simular is marrying the two. Its agent will iterate freely on the task, with the human user in the middle course correcting, until the agent achieves success. Then the human locks in that task’s workflow, which makes it deterministic, repeatable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our solution is, let agents keep exploring the successful trajectory. Once you found a successful trajectory, that becomes deterministic code,” Li explains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reason the startup can do this is because its work — which Li admits is still early — is not just an LLM wrapper that sends and retrieves data to a model.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a new technology which is not used by any other agent company. We call it ‘neuro symbolic computer use agents.’ It’s not fully LLM-based,” he said. “Our approach to solve hallucinations is to let the LLM write code which becomes deterministic. So if you have a workflow that works, the next time we run the same workflow, it’ll be successful as well.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another benefit is that this deterministic code that performs a repeatable task is in the hands of the end user, not the LLM. “Once they have the code, they can trust it, because they can inspect it, they can audit it, they can see what’s going on,” Li says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Time will tell if this method is the magic that will bring agents into the hands of every worker. Li says his early beta customers include a car dealership automating VIN number searches, and HOAs extracting contract information from PDFs. And the company’s <a href=\"https://www.simular.ai/simular-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open source project</a> (available only for Mac OS at the moment) has led to automations ranging from content creation to sales and marketing.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Simular previously raised a $5 million seed, bringing its total raised to about $27 million. Other investors in the company include Basis Set Ventures, Flying Fish Partners, Samsung NEXT, Xoogler Ventures, and podcaster and angel investor Lenny Rachitsky, the company says.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NE-3tFhvf9c?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flags</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10x the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation. While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">astronomical gigawatts of electricity,</a> data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscious way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, SplashMusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has become the de facto standard that all the major AI apps are built to support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon did not announce a timeline for Trainium4. If the company follows previous rollout timelines, we’ll likely hear more about Trainium4 at next year’s conference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">annual enterprise tech event here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NE-3tFhvf9c?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flags</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company announced new tools for managing AI agent boundaries, agent memory capabilities, and agent evaluation features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One upgrade is the introduction of Policy in AgentCore. This feature allows users to set boundaries for agent interactions using natural language. These boundaries integrate with AgentCore Gateway, which connects AI agents with outside tools, to automatically check each agent’s action and stop those that violate written controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Policy allows developers to set access controls to certain internal data or third-party applications like Salesforce or Slack. These boundaries can also include telling an AI agent they can automatically issue refunds up to $100 but must bring a human in the loop for anything larger, David Richardson, vice president of AgentCore, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced AgentCore Evaluations, which is a suite of 13 pre-built evaluation systems for AI agents that monitor factors including correctness, safety, and tool selection accuracy, among others. This also allows developers to have a head start in building their own evaluation features as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That one is really going to help address the biggest fears that people have [with] deploying agents,” Richardson said about the new evaluation capabilities. “[It’s] a thing that a lot of people want to have but is tedious to build.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also announced that it’s building a memory capability into the agent platform, AgentCore Memory. This feature allows agents to develop a log of information on users over time, like their flight time or hotel preferences, and use that information to inform future decisions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Across these three things, we are continuing to iterate at the different layers at AgentCore,” Richardson said. “Talking to existing systems with Policy, [making agents] more powerful with [AgentCore Memory], helping the development team iterate with an agent.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While agents are the <em>soup du jour</em> of the AI industry right now, some people believe the technology won’t last. But Richardson thinks that the tools AgentCore is developing can withstand the fast-moving market even as trends change — which he expects they will.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Being able to take advantage of the reasoning capabilities of these models, which is coupled with being able to do real-world things through tools, feels like a sustainable pattern,” Richardson said. “The way that pattern works will definitely change. I think we feel ready for that.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\">annual enterprise tech event here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ojyZCM6qk?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.
