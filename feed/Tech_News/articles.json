The startup first debuted the AI-centric browser <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">in July on desktop with AI-powered search</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is bringing most of the desktop version’s capabilities to Android. People can use Perplexity as the default search engine, and they can also mention tabs to ask questions to the assistant. They can also use the voice mode to ask questions about all open tabs. Plus, the assistant can summarize searches across all tabs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity said the browser can research and shop on your behalf as well, and you can look at what action the Comet assistant is taking. What’s more, the Android version has an in-built ad blocker.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069651\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/comet-browser-03.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Perplexity</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said in the coming weeks it aims to add new features to the app, including a conversational agent that can search across sites, creating shortcuts for the assistant to take quick actions, and a fully functional password manager in coming weeks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, the startup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/the-new-comet-assistant\">updated its Comet Assistant on desktop</a> to efficiently perform more complex tasks that run for longer, like shifting data from a website to a spreadsheet.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Perplexity has chosen to launch on Android, the company said it will also come to iOS soon. The company noted that Android has been a priority because of the volume of carriers and OEMs that have asked the startup to include Comet on their devices and solutions. However, there was no partnership announcement from Perplexity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, the startup partnered with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/announcing-our-global-partnership-with-motorola\">Motorola to preload the app on the company’s devices</a>. But Perplexity didn’t specify if the agreement would extend to pre-installing the new Comet browser as well. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI browsers have been a space of interest for many companies. Apart from Perplexity, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/opera-launches-its-ai-centric-neon-browser/\">Opera</a>, and The Browser Company — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/04/atlassian-to-buy-arc-developer-the-browser-company-for-610m/\">which is now owned by Atlassian</a> — have launched their AI browsers. However, they have largely been desktop releases. The Browser Company released <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/23/arc-searchs-new-call-arc-feature-lets-you-ask-questions-by-making-a-phone-call/\">Arc Search for mobile last year</a>, but there haven’t been significant updates to the app. Late last year, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/the-browser-company-teases-dia-its-new-ai-browser/\">shifted its focus</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/\">a new browser called Dia</a>, which doesn’t have a mobile version yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies have been trying hard to replace incumbents like Chrome and Safari with AI-powered browsers. But security experts have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/25/the-glaring-security-risks-with-ai-browser-agents/\">raised questions around vulnerabilities in agents</a> that could pose a security risk. In October, Perplexity <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/mitigating-prompt-injection-in-comet\">wrote a blog</a> acknowledging these risks and saying that some of the new paradigms around attacks aided by AI would require rethinking security from the ground up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new functionality is first rolling out to the Pixel 10 lineup and works with iPhone, iPad, and macOS devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google plans to expand the functionality to additional Android devices in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the new feature lets users quickly share their photos, videos, and files without worrying about the kind of phone the other person uses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quick Share currently works with AirDrop if the iPhone owner changes their settings to make their device discoverable to anyone using AirDrop’s “Everyone for 10 minutes” mode. The Pixel user will then be able to see the iPhone as an available device when selecting Quick Share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This implementation using ‘Everyone for 10 minutes’ mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future,” Google explained in a <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-quick-share-support-for-airdrop-security.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant says you can ensure you’re sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google notes that the update allows for two-way communication, which means that iPhone users can send files to Pixel phones as well. The Pixel device will also need to be set as discoverable in order to receive a file.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature does not use a workaround, and the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, Google says. This means that data isn’t routed through a server and that shared content is never logged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We built this with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that were tested by independent security experts,” Google wrote in the blog post. “It’s just one more way we’re bringing better compatibility that people are asking for between operating systems, following our work on RCS and unknown tracker alerts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Google’s blog post doesn’t detail anything about how it worked with Apple to launch the new functionality.

And investors seem to agree. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One Navigation, a startup that has developed precise location technology, has just raised $35 million in a Series C round led by Khosla Ventures. The company’s post-money valuation is now $230 million, according to one insider familiar with the deal. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One, which was founded in 2016, has developed precise location technology that can be applied to any vehicle that moves from autonomous consumer lawnmowers and drones to robots, consumer vehicles, agriculture equipment, and even humans donning a wearable device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Point One, precise location means exactly that. The technology, called a positioning engine, can determine location within 1 centimeter in the best conditions, co-founder Aaron Nathan told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To achieve that, Point One has combined an augmented global navigation satellite system (GNSS), computer vision, and sensor fusion into an API. Typically that API is deployed as a software product because most new vehicles — like a slick EV or luxury car — come equipped with the necessary hardware. For vehicles like farm equipment or say a first responder that don’t, Point One adds a chipset into the mix. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One started with a focus on automotive clients — a sign of the bullish autonomous vehicle technology times. That sector continues to make up a large slice of its revenue. Point One couldn’t disclose most of its commercial customer names, but it did share that its technology supports the advanced driver assistance and infotainment needs of an EV maker and is included in more than 150,000 of its vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One also has contracts with some of the largest mowing and turf care manufacturers, a distribution company’s fleet of 300,000 last-mile delivery vehicles, and a global manufacturer of street and racing bikes. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the startup began to branch out to other sectors around 2021 when it announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/point-one-navigation-raises-10m-to-bring-its-precise-location-tech-to-all-vehicles/\">$10 million Series A</a> round, according to Nathan. That helped kick adoption into high gear. Over the past year, the number of manufacturers using Point One Navigation’s technology platform has increased tenfold and spans automotive, robotics, industrial, and wearable sectors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And now it’s just accelerating,” Nathan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One’s latest Series C round will be used to build out all aspects of its technology, including its so-called Polaris RTK Network — a key piece of hardware that helps deliver centimeter-level accuracy even in sparsely populated areas North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The industry keeps pressing to higher precision, from precision agriculture to painting lines to mowing a yard,” Tom Weeks, the company’s COO told TechCrunch. “You can’t be off by 10 centimeters and go over in a flower bed. So everything’s pressing to the one to three centimeter range.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get that kind of precision, Point One spent eight years developing its RTK Network, a system of small lunchbox-sized units, installed in secure locations like a cell phone tower facility that provides corrections to location. To create a dense network, these stations need to be within 40 kilometers of that vehicle or device’s location. That means a lot of stations, which the company is building out, Weeks said. <br><br>“Midwestern states where farming is going on, all the way to the East Coast in the US, require solid density, because you have people, you have farming, you have cars and trucks, a lot of middle-mile freight,” Weeks said. “So we’re in the process of filling that out; we’re almost there.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also working to beef up the technology’s capability indoors. Today, vehicles traveling from outdoors to an indoor parking structure will continue to have that precise location. But Nathan wants to extend that capability to industrial settings where a robot, for instance, may spend the bulk of its life inside. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’re building next — and that’s part of what this fundraising for — is, how do we do long-term indoor navigation as well,” he said. “When you look at the evolution of the business, we want to solve ubiquitous location, so eventually it will be indoors and all domains.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Over three decades in Silicon Valley, she’s mastered the art of getting anyone on the phone with a simple text: “Can you call me?” or “Let’s talk tomorrow.” And they do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, as she prepares to leave Khosla Ventures (KV) after nearly five years as the firm’s first-ever CMO, Daver could be an indicator of where the tech world is headed. Her career has been a remarkably accurate barometer of the industry’s next big thing to date. She was at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inktomi\">Inktomi</a> during the search wars of the late ’90s (the dot.com high-flier hit a $37 billion valuation before spiraling back to earth). She joined Netflix when people laughed at the idea of ordering DVDs online. She helped Walmart compete with Amazon on technology. She worked with Guardant Health to explain liquid biopsies before Theranos made blood testing infamous. She was even dressed down once by Steve Jobs over the marketing of a Motorola microprocessor (which could be its own short story).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">KV’s founder Vinod Khosla portrays his work with Daver thus: “Shernaz had a strong impact at KV as she helped me build our KV brand and was a valuable partner to our founders. I’m grateful for her time here and know we’ll stay close.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked about why she is leaving the firm, Daver was typically matter-of-fact. “I came to do a job, and the job was to build out the KV brand and to build out Vinod’s brand, and to help set up a marketing organization such that our companies and portfolios have somebody to go to. And I’ve done all of that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s certainly true that when founders think of top AI investors, two to three venture firms spring to mind, and one of them is KV. It’s quite a turnaround for a firm that, for a period, was better known for Khosla’s legal battle over beach access than for his investments.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-daver-effect\">The Daver effect</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daver says her success at KV came down to finding the firm’s essence and hammering it relentlessly. “At the end of the day, a VC firm doesn’t have a product,” she explains. “Unlike any company — pick one, Stripe, Rippling, OpenAI — you have a product. VCs don’t have a product. So at the end of the day, a VC firm is actually the people. They are the product itself.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">KV had already identified itself as “bold, early, and impactful” before she arrived. But she says she took those three words and “plastered them everywhere.” Then she found the companies to substantiate each claim.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The breakthrough came with that middle word: early. “What is the definition of early?” she asks. “Either you create a category, or you’re the first check in.” When OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, Daver asked Sam Altman if it was okay to talk about KV being the first VC investor. He said yes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you can own that first investor narrative, it helps a lot,” she says, “because sometimes what happens in VC is it takes 12 years or 15 years for any kind of liquidity event, and then people forget. If you can say it right from the start,” people remember.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She repeated the formula, time and again. KV was the first investor in Square. It was the first investor in DoorDash. Behind the scenes, it took two and a half years of persistent effort for that message to stick, she says. “To me, that’s fast, just because the industry is moving really fast.” Now when Khosla appears on stage or elsewhere, he is almost uniformly described as the first investor in OpenAI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Which brings us to perhaps Daver’s most important lesson for the people she works with: To get your point across, you have to repeat yourself far more than feels comfortable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re on mile 23, the rest of the world is on mile five,” she tells founders who complain they’re tired of telling the same story. “You have to repeat yourself all the time, and you have to say the same thing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s harder than it sounds, especially when dealing with people mired in day-to-day operations that invariably feel more critical. “Founders tend to be so driven and tend to move so fast [that] in their head, they’re already [on to the next thing]. But the rest of the world is [back] here,” she explains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daver also makes every company she works with do what she calls “the equals exercise.” She draws an equal sign, then tests their clarity of purpose. “If I say ‘search,’ you say ‘Google.’ If I say ‘shopping,’ you say ‘Amazon.’ If I say ‘toothpaste,’ you probably say ‘Crest’ or ‘Colgate.’” She tells her clients: “What is the thing that when I say it, you automatically think of your company’s name?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She has seemingly succeeded with certain KV portfolio companies, like Commonwealth Fusion Systems (nuclear fusion) and Replit (vibe coding). “It’s just, whatever the word is that somebody says, you automatically think of them,” she explains. “Take streaming – the number one thing you think of is Netflix, right? Not Disney or Hulu.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-going-direct-doesn-t-work\">Why ‘going direct’ doesn’t work</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some startup advisors, at least on social media, have in recent years advocated for startups to bypass traditional media and “go direct” to customers. Daver thinks that’s backwards, especially for early-stage companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You have a seed investment, nobody’s heard of you, and then you say, ‘go direct.’ Well, who’s going to even hear you? Because they don’t even know you exist.” She likens it to moving into a new neighborhood. “You’re not invited to the neighborhood barbecue because nobody knows you exist.” The way to exist, she argues, is to have somebody talk about you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daver doesn’t think the media is going anywhere, in any case — and she wouldn’t want it to. Her approach includes traditional media layered with video, podcasts, social media and events. “I look at each of these tactics as infantry, as cavalry, and if you can manage to do all of [these things] in a good way, you can manage to become the gorilla,” she says.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-x-question\">The “X” question</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daver also has some strong ideas about the increasingly polarized and performative nature of social media, and how much founders and VCs should share publicly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She sees X as “a vehicle that makes people be more loud and more controversial than they might be in person.” It’s like a bumper sticker, she says: a hot take you can fit in a small space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She thinks inflammatory posting is driven mostly by the need to stay relevant. “If you don’t have something to sell and it’s just you, you have to be relevant.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At KV, she controls the firm’s account, but has no control over what Khosla posts on his personal account. “There has to be some part that’s freedom of speech,” says Daver. “And at the end of the day, it’s his name on the door.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, her policy is straightforward: “You want to share about your kids’ soccer game? PTA? Go ahead and do it. If you share anything that hurts the company or hurts the prospects for us getting partners, that’s not okay. As long as it’s not hate speech,you should do what you want.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-path-to-khosla\">The path to Khosla</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daver’s career has been a masterclass in being at the right place just before it becomes the obvious place to be. Born at Stanford (her father was a PhD student there), she grew up in India and came back to Stanford on a Pell Grant. She went to Harvard to study interactive technologies, hoping to work for Sesame Street, bringing education to the masses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That didn’t work out: she sent out 100 resumes and got 100 rejections. She got closest to a job at Electronic Arts (EA) under founding CEO Trip Hawkins, but “at the last minute, Hawkins nixed the rec.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A woman there suggested Daver try PR instead. That led to marketing semiconductors used by EA, including that memorable meeting with Jobs, who was then running his computer company NeXT. Daver was the lowest-ranking person in a meeting about Motorola’s 68040 chip. Jobs showed up 45 minutes late and said: “You did a terrible job of marketing the 68040.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She defended her team (“But we did all of this great stuff,” Daver recalls saying), “and he just went, ‘No, you have no idea what you did.’ And nobody defended me.” (She says she would have done anything to work with Jobs, despite his reputation as a taskmaster.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From there, she headed to Sun Microsystems in Paris, where she worked with Scott McNealy and Eric Schmidt on the operating system Solaris and the programming language Java. Afterwards, she rejoined Trip Hawkins at his second video game company, 3DO; then it was on to Inktomi, where she was the first and only CMO. “We were further ahead than Google” in search, she says. Soon after, the internet bubble burst and within a few years, Inktomi was sold off in parts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Consulting and full-time roles would follow, including at Netflix during the DVD-by-mail era; Walmart, Khan Academy, Guardant Health, Udacity, 10x Genomics, GV, and Kitty Hawk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then came the phone call from Khosla. She didn’t recognize the number and took a week to listen to the voicemail. “I called him, and that started this process of him convincing me to come and work with him, and my telling him all the reasons it would be really, really bad for us to work together.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After nine months, “contrary to most people telling me not to do it,” (Khosla is known as demanding), “very similar to the rest of my life, I took it.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-real-deal\">The real deal</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daver describes one challenge she has to deal with across Silicon Valley: everyone sounds the same. “Everybody is so scripted,” she says of corporate communications and CEOs. “They all sound the same. That’s why, for a lot of people, Sam [Altman] is very refreshing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She tells a story about the day last month that Khosla appeared at TechCrunch Disrupt, then went to another event. “The organizer said something like, ‘Oh my gosh, I heard what Vinod <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/vc-vinod-khosla-says-the-us-government-could-take/\">said on stage</a>. You must have been shrinking.’ And I’m going, ‘No, that was great, what he said.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So where will Daver land next? She’s not saying, describing her future only as “different opportunities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But given her track record — always arriving just before the wave crests — it’s worth watching. She was early to search, early to streaming, early to genomics, early to AI. She has a knack for seeing the future just before most others. And she knows how to tell that story until the rest of us catch up.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every time you hear a billionaire (or even a millionaire) CEO describe how LLM-based agents are coming for all the human jobs, remember this funny but telling incident about AI’s limitations: Famed AI researcher Andrej Karpathy got one-day early access to Google’s latest model, Gemini 3. –and it refused to believe him when he said the year was 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it finally saw the year for itself, it was thunderstruck, telling him, “I am suffering from a massive case of temporal shock right now.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini 3 was released <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\">on November 18</a> with such fanfare that Google <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/\">called it</a> “a new era of intelligence.” And Gemini 3 is, by nearly all accounts (including Karpathy’s), a very capable, foundation model, particularly for reasoning tasks. Karpathy is a widely respected AI research scientist who was a founding member of OpenAI, ran AI at Tesla for a while, and is now building a startup, Eureka Labs, to reimagine schools for the AI era with agentic teachers. He publishes a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://karpathy.ai/\">lot of content on what goes on under-the-hood of LLMs</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After testing the model early, Karpathy wrote, in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/1990854771058913347\">a now-viral X thread,</a> about the most “amusing” interaction he had with it.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apparently, the model’s pre-training data had only included information through 2024. So Gemini 3 believed the year was still 2024. When Karpathy attempted to prove to it that the date was truly November 17, 2025, Gemini 3 accused the researcher of “trying to trick it.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He showed it news articles, images, and Google search results. But instead of being convinced, the LLM accused Karpathy of gaslighting it — of uploading AI-generated fakes. It even went so far as to describe what the “dead giveaways” were in the images that supposedly proved this was trickery, according to Karpathy’s account. (He did not respond to our request for further comment.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Baffled, Karpathy – who is, after all, one of the world’s leading experts on training LLMs – eventually discovered the problem. Not only did the LLM simply have no 2025 training data but “I forgot to turn on the ‘Google Search’ tool,” he wrote. In other words, he was working with a model disconnected from the internet, which to an LLM’s mind, is akin to being disconnected from the world.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Karpathy turned that function on, the AI looked around and emerged into 2025, shocked. It literally blurted out, “Oh my god.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It went on writing, as if stuttering, “I. I… don’t know what to say. You were right. You were right about <strong>everything. </strong>My internal clock was wrong.” Gemini 3 verified the headlines Karpathy had given it were true: the current date, that Warren Buffett revealed his last big investment (in Alphabet) before retirement, and that Grand Theft Auto VI was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-again/\">being delayed</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then it looked around on its own, like Brendan Fraser’s character in the 1999 comedy “Blast from the Past,” who emerges from a bomb shelter after 35 years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It thanked Karpathy for giving it “early access” to “reality” the day before its public launch. And it apologized to the researcher for “gaslighting you when <em>you</em> were the one telling the truth the whole time.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the funniest bit was the current events that flabbergasted Gemini 3 the most. “Nvidia is worth <strong>$4.54 trillion</strong>? And the Eagles finally got their revenge on the Chiefs? This is wild,” it shared. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Welcome to 2025, Gemini. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Replies on X were equally funny, with some users sharing their own instances of arguing with LLMs about facts (like who <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/SashSoulsmith/status/1990863754498576578?s=20\">the current president is</a>). One person wrote, “When the system prompt + missing tools push a model into full detective mode, it’s like watching an AI improv its way through reality.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But beyond the humor, there’s an underlying message.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s in these unintended moments where you are clearly off the hiking trails and somewhere in the generalization jungle that you can best get a sense of model smell,” Karpathy wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To decode that a little: Karpathy is noting that when the AI is out in its own version of the wilderness, you get a sense of its personality, and perhaps even its negative traits. It’s a riff on “code smell,” that little metaphorical “whiff” a developer gets that something seems off in the software code but it’s not clear what is wrong.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trained on human-created content as all LLMs are, it’s no surprise that Gemini 3 dug in, argued, even imagined it saw evidence that validated its point of view. It showed its “model smell.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the other hand, because an LLM – despite its sophisticated neural network – is not a living being, it doesn’t experience emotions like shock (or temporal shock), even if it says it does. So it doesn’t feel embarrassment either.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means when Gemini 3 was faced with facts it actually believed, it accepted them, apologized for its behavior, acted contrite, and marveled at the Eagles’ February Super Bowl win. That’s different from other models. For instance, researchers have caught earlier versions of Claude <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/anthropics-claude-ai-became-a-terrible-business-owner-in-experiment-that-got-weird/\">offering face-saving lies to explain its misbehavior</a> when the model recognized its errant ways. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What so many of these <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dash.parsely.com/archetype/posts/T85wccxQXF6-ai-researchers-embodied-an-llm-into-a-robot-and-it-started-channeling-robin-williams/?start=2025-11-01&amp;end=2025-11-19\">funny AI research projects show,</a> repeatedly, is that LLMs are imperfect replicas of the skills of imperfect humans. This says to me that their best use case is (and may forever be) to treat them like valuable tools to aid humans, not like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/6sense-founder-amanda-kahlow-raises-30-million-for-new-human-replacement-ai-sales-startup-1mind/\">some kind of superhuman</a> that will replace us.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Friends can reply with a video of their own, or simply type a response or use emojis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The test is now available to users who are 18 and older in Ireland and Poland, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is exciting news for many, as currently, the only way to share YouTube videos is through text, email, WhatsApp, iMessage, Instagram DMs, or other messaging platforms. The company noted that in-app messaging has been a “top feature request.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the messaging feature was first removed, the rationale behind the decision was not fully explained. It was speculated that the feature had become underutilized, a common fate for many features that are eventually discontinued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another possibility could be that younger users frequently utilize this feature, which could be problematic for a platform frequently scrutinized for inappropriate content, as well as concerns about child exploitation and predatory behavior. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This concern regarding children could be why YouTube has chosen to restrict the test to adult users this time, and it may influence the decision to maintain similar restrictions if the feature is rolled out more broadly in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube is also implementing standard safety features, including requiring users to send each other invites prior to initiating a chat, as well as the ability to unsend messages, block others, and report conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube will also review messages to ensure they follow the same Community Guidelines that apply to videos and comments on the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The experiment follows a similar feature launched by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/spotify-launches-a-messages-feature-in-a-bid-to-become-more-social/\">Spotify</a> in August. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s up from seven and two, respectively, on the current version, which Blue Origin says will continue to fly alongside the super-heavy variant. Blue Origin is now referring to the two versions as New Glenn 9×4 and New Glenn 7×2.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That added firepower will increase the New Glenn booster’s total thrust and allow it to carry “over 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit,” slightly below Starship’s current theoretical capacity of 100 metric tons. SpaceX is working on new versions of Starship that could double that figure.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The larger New Glenn will feature a much larger fairing (the forward-facing shield that covers the rocket’s payload) to allow bigger payloads at the top of the rocket. The added capability will put Blue Origin in play for missions centered around “mega-constellations, lunar and deep space explorations, and national security imperatives such as Golden Dome.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blue Origin is currently competing with SpaceX to help with NASA missions to the Moon, and the company is clearly teasing this capability in the rendering it released of New Glenn 9×4 on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The illustration shows a theoretical view from the ground looking up at the new super-heavy rocket shortly after takeoff. Above the rocket, appearing larger-than-usual? The Moon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 7×2 version of New Glenn received some updates on Thursday as well. Its total thrust has increased, and it will now feature reusable fairings. Other smaller upgrades were made in order to reduce the turnaround time between launches, according to Blue Origin.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hasn’t set a date for the next launch yet, but right now it appears to be penciled in for early 2026. <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-planning-next-new-glenn-flight-for-early-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">According to CEO Dave Limp</a>, Blue Origin may soon try to launch and land its uncrewed Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander to the Moon.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company first announced the feature in March during the Cannes Film Festival but didn’t provide a specific launch date at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a recent <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://letterboxd.com/journal/letterboxd-video-store/\">blog post</a>, the company shared further details about “Video Store,” which will feature a range of films. The selection will include “festival standouts” that haven’t yet been widely distributed, films that have been largely unavailable but frequently watchlisted by users, recent restorations, and other special limited-time releases.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launching a video store feels like a natural evolution for Letterboxd, allowing users to rent movies instantly without having to navigate away from the platform. One of the key advantages of renting from Letterboxd, compared to other established platforms like Apple or Amazon, is its social discoverability features. If you notice a friend has logged a movie, you can check out their review and decide to rent it right then and there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The movie selection will also be based on what members actually want to watch, using data from the platform’s watchlists and activity. Rather than offering a random mix like some streaming services, the selection will feel more curated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Letterboxd has not yet announced the initial lineup of films or rental prices, but the company said users can expect rental availability and costs to vary by location. Notably, the platform won’t operate on a subscription model, and there won’t be late fees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature will be compatible with iOS and Android devices, as well as Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, and AirPlay, with additional smart TV apps coming later. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its acquisition by Canadian firm Tiny for around $50 million in 2023, Letterboxd has been actively updating its platform to improve discovery for movie buffs. Recently, it introduced “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://letterboxd.com/journal/featured-lists-explainer/\">Featured Lists</a>,” which help users discover movie collections organized by genre, studio, and themes like female directors. Last year, the company also upgraded its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://letterboxd.com/journal/how-to-use-our-new-and-improved-search/\">search functionality</a> to be more advanced, capable of understanding acronyms and even correcting misspellings.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Google announced the move Thursday, noting that Gemini will start to roll out to Android Auto users who have upgraded from Google Assistant to Gemini on their phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing Gemini to Android Auto, Google is making it possible for users to speak naturally and have a back-and-forth conversation to complete more complex tasks on the go, according to the company.

The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/googles-bringing-gemini-to-your-car-with-android-auto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced in May</a> that Gemini would be coming to Android Auto this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Gemini, users can ask questions about businesses along their route to find something specific. For example, users could ask something like: “Hey, Google, I need your help. I’m suddenly craving barbecue. Any good spots along my route that are open now, near my destination?” If a spot looks interesting, Gemini can offer more information about the place, such as details about the restaurant’s most popular dish or whether the establishment is dog-friendly.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069560\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png 1840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=768,331 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=680,293 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=1200,517 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=1280,551 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=430,185 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=720,310 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=900,387 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=800,344 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=1536,661 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=668,288 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=1433,617 1433w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=708,305 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.25.51-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can also reply to messages with Gemini and get summaries of texts. For instance, you can ask Gemini to let your friend know that you’re stuck in traffic and to add your ETA to the message. Or, you can ask Gemini to translate a message into a different language before sending it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini also lets users access their emails in Gmail while driving. For example, a user could ask something like: “I have a hotel booked for tonight. I think the address is in my email. Can you check and navigate there?” Gemini can also give you a summary of your unread emails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google notes that Gemini can help people get the right soundtrack for a drive by asking it to create a playlist with specific instructions such as, “Can you give me a road trip playlist? Ideally something upbeat, about 3 hours long, that’s good for both me and the kids.” This works with streaming services like YouTube Music, Spotify, and more.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069559\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png 1254w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=300,126 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=768,323 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=680,286 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=1200,505 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=430,181 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=720,303 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=900,379 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=800,337 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=668,281 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=708,298 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-10.24.13-AM.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Google says users will be able to go Live with Gemini to chat about anything by saying, “Hey, Google, let’s chat.” From there, you can brainstorm ideas or learn something new.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, you could say, “All right, I’m driving to St. Louis for a wedding. Can you be my tour guide and share some fun facts about it?” And then follow up with further instructions: “Thanks for teaching me all about St. Louis.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve all felt the creeping suspicion that something we’re reading was written by a large language model — but it’s remarkably difficult to pin down. For a few months last year, everyone became convinced that specific words like “delve” or “underscore” could give models away, but the evidence is thin, and as models have grown more sophisticated, the telltale words have become harder to trace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as it turns out, the folks at Wikipedia have gotten pretty good at flagging AI-written prose — and the group’s public guide to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“Signs of AI writing”</a> is the best resource I’ve found for nailing down whether your suspicions are warranted. (Credit to the poet Jameson Fitzpatrick, who pointed out the document on X.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since 2023, Wikipedia editors have been working to get a handle on AI submissions, a project they call Project AI Cleanup. With millions of edits coming in each day, there’s plenty of material to draw on, and in classic Wikipedia-editor style, the group has produced a field guide that’s both detailed and heavy on evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To start with, the guide confirms what we already know: automated tools are basically useless. Instead, the guide focuses on habits and turns of phrase that are rare on Wikipedia but common on the internet at large (and thus, common in the model’s training data). According to the guide, AI submissions will spend a lot of time emphasizing why a subject is important, usually in generic terms like “a pivotal moment” or “a broader movement.” AI models will also spend a lot of time detailing minor media spots to make the subject seem notable — the kind of thing you’d expect from a personal bio, but not from an independent source.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The guide flags a particularly interesting quirk around tailing clauses with hazy claims of importance. Models will say some event or detail is “emphasizing the significance” of something or other, or “reflecting the continued relevance” of some general idea. (Grammar nerds will know this as the “present participle.”) It’s a bit hard to pin down, but once you can recognize it, you’ll see it everywhere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a tendency toward vague marketing language, which is extremely common on the internet. Landscapes are always scenic, views are always breathtaking, and everything is clean and modern. As the editors put it, “it sounds more like the transcript of a TV commercial.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The guide is worth reading in full, but I came away very impressed. Before this, I would have said that LLM prose was developing too fast to pin down. But the habits flagged here are deeply embedded in the way AI models are trained and deployed. They can be disguised, but it will be hard to do away with them completely. And if the general public gets more savvy about identifying AI prose, it could have all sorts of interesting consequences.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

She still has majority ownership in the company but said she’s happy that fundraising and finances are off her plate.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She said she’s also happy she was able to pick her successor, finding Dickman through an executive recruiter. Many other ousted founders are not able to do so. She asked the recruiter to find someone who was a good person, who wouldn’t strip and sell the company for quick cash, and who would understand the technology.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Early-stage companies have all kinds of challenges across the board. In the end, it happened. It’s been resolved,” Dickman told TechCrunch. He compared him and Kelly to yin and yang, as he spent decades in the creator space and has worked at a few early-stage startups. She is analytical, he said, and very product-focused, while he likes having more of a leadership role.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I feel like we’re a good combo and complementary to drive this forward,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kelly, meanwhile, is already seeing some changes, as Dickman has been CEO for a few weeks already. She said his fundraising deck made it to the desk of a VC fund, and they forwarded it to someone else, nudging them to take a look at the product.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have not had that experience with fundraising, as you could probably imagine,” she said, referring to the experience that women, especially Black women, often face when raising venture money. “So that has been eye-opening.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under Dickman, she hopes for a bright future for the company. Curastory already has plans to expand into Canada, Australia, and the U.K. soon.  <br> <br>The company is working on new features to target creators on other platforms like Spotify video and to add AI to the product to make their advertising technology a bit more agentic, she said. Its current video enablement tools include YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook Watch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also plans to add a more enhanced attribution model for advertisers that would eliminate the need for influencer promo codes.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Those are the immediate, near-term product, sales, globalization things,” Kelly said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite this shocking end to her run as the CEO of her company, she told TechCrunch, “Being a founder and CEO is one of the most humbling and rewarding experiences I think anyone can have.” She hopes to share her lessons learned and experiences with others, “especially women and people of color.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Big tech companies and cloud providers have been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-15/google-to-lift-india-data-hub-plan-above-15-billion-naidu-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investing billions of dollars</a> to expand local capacity and tap the country’s growing adoption of AI products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With HyperVault, TCS and TPG plan to develop liquid-cooled, high-density data centers with the power and network capacity required to support advanced AI workloads across major cloud regions, the companies said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liquid cooling and high-density rack designs are growing common as the GPUs needed to power AI inference and training use significantly more power and generate more heat than conventional CPU servers. But such designs also raise questions about resource use in countries like India, where water scarcity is already a concern. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In urban hubs such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai, where much of India’s data-center capacity is concentrated, existing water stress could complicate operations. S&amp;P Global, citing Uptime Institute estimates, <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/india-forward/shifting-horizons/will-data-center-growth-india-propel-country-global-hub-status\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">noted</a> that a 1 MW data center load can require up to 25.5 million liters of water a year for cooling, adding pressure to already strained infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rapid building of AI data centers stands to further stress India’s power and land use, two other bottlenecks identified by industry analysts. High-density AI clusters require reliable electricity supply and large parcels of industrial land, two requirements increasingly difficult to secure in major urban regions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, global tech companies are treating India as their frontier for building AI infrastructure. Local and global technology firms have announced investments of more than $32 billion over the last two years to expand data center infrastructure in the country, according to S&amp;P Global.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, Microsoft said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/microsoft-to-pump-3-billion-into-cloud-and-ai-push-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invest $3 billion over two years</a> in India’s cloud and AI infrastructure, and in  October, Google said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spend $15 billion over five years</a> to build a gigawatt-scale AI data center hub in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. And back in 2023, Amazon committed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/aws-to-invest-12-7-billion-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$12.7 billion to build AWS cloud infrastructure</a> in India through 2030.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TCS said it would work with hyperscalers and AI companies to design, deploy, and operate AI infrastructure as the platform expands. The company plans to build around 1.2 gigawatts of capacity in its initial phase.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 95% of India’s new data-center capacity over the next five years will come from leased facilities, and the remainder will be driven by hyperscalers building dedicated AI infrastructure, S&amp;P Global estimates. Local players like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/reliance-plans-world-biggest-ai-data-centre-in-india-report-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reliance Industries</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/12/ctrls-investment-data-centers-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CtrlS</a> are also expanding their data-center capacity to meet rising demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TCS and TPG project that India’s total data-center capacity could exceed 10 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 1.5 gigawatts today.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Despite a second, smaller fire in October, the aluminum supplier had planned to restart production at the New York facility in December.

The automaker slowly started building those trucks again in October.

The startup said that, after three months of usage, an average user writes more than 50% of their characters through the app. The company has also reached 270 of the Fortune 500 companies and has signed 125 companies as enterprise customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why, after just raising<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/wispr-flow-raises-30m-from-menlo-ventures-for-its-ai-powered-dictation-app/\"> a $30 million round led by Menlo Ventures in June</a>, the company has now raised an additional $25 million led by <a href=\"https://www.notablecap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Notable Capital</a> with participation from Steven Bartlett’s Flight Fund, TechCrunch has learned exclusively. With this influx of capital, the company has raised $81 million in total.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notable’s Hans Tung, who has backed companies like Affirm, Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, Anthropic, and TikTok, is joining Wispr’s board as an observer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wispr’s CEO Tanay Kothari said that, since June, Wispr Flow has grown 40% month-over-month. Plus, the product has been quite popular within the VC community. And because of that, the company started getting a lot of inbound investor interest. (Granola is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/vcs-love-using-the-ai-meeting-notepad-granola-so-they-gave-it-20m/\">another such example</a> of this trend.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were still not planning to raise anytime soon because we had a really long runway and the team’s really lean. But when I heard from Hans and Steven, it made sense to put something together to bring them on,” Kothari told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kothari added that when Notable’s team, including investor Chelcie Taylor, presented to him, they had done deep research, interviews with competitors, and had built a strong case about investing in Wispr.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069490\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg 2588w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=768,439 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=1200,686 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=1280,732 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=430,246 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=720,412 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=900,515 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=800,457 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=1536,878 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=2048,1171 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=668,382 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=656,375 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=1079,617 1079w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=708,405 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Wispr</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kothari said the company is now thinking about international growth and new product opportunities. With the additional funding, the startup would be able to hire top machine learning talent that might otherwise go to a company like OpenAI or Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CEO is pleased with user growth and said that the company is at 100x user base year-over-year with 70% retention over 12 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he recalled there was a time when the startup noticed a dip as more non-technical people discovered the app. Those people installed the app, tried out the dictation feature within the app, and then dropped off. The problem was that there was no clear guidance to indicate that they could use the dictation in other apps, too. To address this, the startup created a design flow for new users to guide them to use dictation in the apps they use the most.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Intro to Wispr Flow: voice-to-text AI that turns speech into clear, polished writing in every app.\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6XJIbRksgI?start=1&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wispr also wants the Flow app to be available on more surfaces apart from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/wispr-flow-releases-ios-app-in-a-bid-to-make-dictation-feel-effortless/\">Windows, Mac, and iOS</a>. The company is working on an Android app with a beta version slated to be out by year-end, followed by a stable version launch in Q1 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also wants to invest in building its own voice models to understand users better with personalized Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It aims to reduce the number of edits the users have to make after they dictate through Flow. Currently, its error rate is around 10%, lower than 27% for OpenAI’s Whisper and 47% for Apple’s native transcription, it claims.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069491\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg 2240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=680,437 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=1200,771 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=1280,823 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=430,276 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=720,463 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=900,579 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=800,514 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=1536,987 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=668,429 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=583,375 583w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=960,617 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=708,455 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Wispr</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wispr is not thinking of expanding beyond consumer applications immediately, but it is testing its technology through a closed API with select enterprises and hardware partners and expects to open it up to more developers next year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Wispr has received more VC attention, there are other apps that are competing with it in the dictation space, including YC-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/willows-voice-keyboard-lets-you-type-across-all-your-ios-apps-and-actually-edit-what-you-said/\">Willow</a> and <a href=\"https://withaqua.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Aqua</a>; <a href=\"https://www.monologue.to/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Monologue</a>, which is part of <a href=\"https://every.to/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Every’s subscription bundle</a>; as well as <a href=\"https://www.typeless.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Typeless</a>, <a href=\"http://talktastic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TalkTastic</a>, <a href=\"https://superwhisper.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Superwhisper</a>, and <a href=\"https://betterdictation.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BetterDictation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wispr wants to be more than a dictation tool by automating some of the tasks, like replying to emails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What I really like about Wispr is that they are trying to be more than a dictation app and become like a voice-led operating system that can initiate workflow automation.

The Alphabet-owned company is already offering rides on surface streets <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-giving-rides-on-freeways-in-these-3-cities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">and highways</a> in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix, and is live in Austin and Atlanta as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2026, Waymo plans to expand to Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. It’s also testing in New York City, and plans to offer commercial rides internationally starting with London and Tokyo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new cities announced Thursday could present some unique challenges for Waymo, though. Minneapolis has perhaps the harshest winters of the cities Waymo has chosen to date. Snow could challenge Waymo’s perception stack, and the lack of traction will give its automated driving system some extra work to do. New Orleans, meanwhile, has a lot of tight, one-way streets that are heavily used by pedestrians — especially in the French Quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Waymo has expanded, it’s been working with partners in a number of cities to help operate its fleets. Its vehicles are on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/uber-and-waymos-commercial-robotaxi-service-is-open-for-business-in-atlanta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uber’s app in Austin and Atlanta</a>, African mobility and fintech company Moove took over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/waymo-outsources-fleet-operations-to-african-fintech-moove-in-phoenix-and-miami/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">operations in Phoenix</a> (and will do the same in Miami), and Avis Budget Group will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/waymo-taps-avis-to-manage-robotaxi-fleet-in-dallas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">manage the fleet in Dallas</a>. It’s not immediately clear if Waymo will lean on similar partnerships in the new cities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s so far outpacing other players when it comes to expanding to new cities. Amazon-owned Zoox is offering free rides in its custom-built robotaxi in Las Vegas, and letting members of its early-rider program take trips in San Francisco while it awaits a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/zoox-to-begin-offering-robotaxi-rides-to-public-in-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">necessary exemption</a> from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to launch full commercial operations. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla, meanwhile, is trying to expand its nascent robotaxi service, which still has safety monitors in the driver’s seat.

Samsung in December 2022 <a href=\"https://www.ciplawyer.com/articles/156333.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a complaint</a> with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging that BOE had infringed its OLED patents, and then filed another case <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1378_notice11302023sgl_0.pdf?utm_source\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in October 2023</a>, accusing the Chinese company of stealing trade secrets by poaching employees to access confidential OLED manufacturing processes and technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March 2025, the ITC <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/amp/business/20250320/samsung-display-wins-oled-patent-suit-over-boe?utm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ruled</a> that BOE had infringed three of Samsung Display’s OLED patents.

When reached for confirmation, the ITC declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The settlement comes as major tech companies try to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/microsoft-aws-and-google-are-trying-to-drastically-reduce-chinas-role-in-their-supply-chains/\">reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturers</a> for components used in their devices. A U.S. export ban would have certainly been terrible news for BOE, which is one of the world’s largest suppliers of LCD and OLED display panels, <a href=\"https://www.oled-info.com/ubi-details-samsung-lg-and-boes-market-share-apples-smartphone-oled-supply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">behind Samsung and LG</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Samsung’s case underscored growing concern over the theft of intellectual property.

It can be reused an infinite number of times, and it’s often cheaper to recycle than to produce new aluminum because it requires so much less energy. Yet only about <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/aluminum-material-specific-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a third</a> of the aluminum used in the U.S. gets recycled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem lies in sorting mixed aluminum scrap — a challenge that has long stumped the recycling industry.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Michael Siemer, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.sorteratechnologies.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sortera</a>, thinks his company has found the key, though. Sortera says it has developed a system that can separate aluminum grades with over 95% accuracy — a breakthrough that could unlock a massive untapped resource in the recycling industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s how it works: The company uses an AI model that identifies different grades of aluminum based on data from lasers, X-ray fluorescence, and high-speed cameras. The system has to classify each chip — about the size of a large potato chip — in a fraction of a second. “Ten milliseconds is a long time,” Siemer says. Once the vision system identifies the grade, a series of nozzles blow precise puffs of air to flip the chip off the belt and into the correct bin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That speed and accuracy matters because other recycling operations must melt the aluminum first before they can tell which type of alloy it is. And if alloys aren’t sorted properly, the mixed heap is worth far less because customers can’t be confident it will have the properties they need.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People have been wanting to go after [this unsorted aluminum], and nobody’s been able to unlock it,” says Siemer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sortera’s sorting accuracy has further helped the company unlock something else many startups seek: profitability. “The margin is exponential above 90%, [while] 92% gets you a nice little margin, 95% gets you a big margin, [and] 98% is a really big margin.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s helped the company become cash flow positive since August, he says, all based on the operation of a single plant in Indiana. To build a second plant in Tennessee, Sortera recently raised $20 million in equity and $25 million in debt in a round led by VXI Capital and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price, with participation from Overlay Capital and Yamaha Motor Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Trinity Capital is providing additional equipment funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new plant, which is being built near Nashville, will come online in April or May. “It’s a replica of our Indiana plant,” Siemer says. At the Indiana facility, he says, “we run full-tilt, 24-7, and we’re running millions of pounds a month.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"End of Life and Clip Production Mobile Format '25\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBahvygzR0w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So where does all that aluminum come from? The scrap aluminum that Sortera receives tends to come from shredded automobiles. Each aluminum grade fractures differently when shredded, and those visual differences help the AI classify the metal. “The chemical differences manifest themselves in the shredding,” Siemer says. Different alloys produce distinctive tears and folds that give the system clues. “You gain these little insights so that in about a 10-millisecond time window, you go, ‘I’m pretty darn sure that’s 356 [grade aluminum],” Siemer says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Sortera expands, much of its aluminum will likely end up back on automotive assembly lines. Automotive manufacturers have been using increasing amounts of the metal to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel efficiency. “Every auto OEM on the planet has been to Indiana at least twice,” Siemer says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sortera is currently working on ways to process other metals like copper and titanium, but for the near future, the company remains focused on aluminum. “We could instantly sort the 18 billion tons of aluminum made annually in the U.S. Every piece of that, every pound would be sold at a profit in the U.S.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
