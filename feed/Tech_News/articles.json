The tech giant <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.google/feed/notebooklm-is-now-available-to-younger-users/\">announced</a> that NotebookLM is available to Google Workspace for Education users of any age and for consumers ages 13 and up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The removal of age restrictions is intended to provide younger students with access to the AI research tool, allowing them to better understand their class materials. Now, students can access features such as the ability to convert notes into podcast-like Audio Overviews, visually summarize ideas with interactive Mind Maps, and more. NotebookLM recently released <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/googles-notebooklm-rolls-out-video-overviews/\">Video Overviews</a> to let users turn notes, PDFs, and images into visual presentations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This expansion comes amid increasing concerns about the use of AI in education regarding data privacy and potential misuse. Google says that NotebookLM enforces stricter content policies for users under 18 to prevent inappropriate responses, and user chats and uploads are not reviewed by humans or used for AI training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The availability of NotebookLM for younger users follows OpenAI’s introduction of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/openai-launches-study-mode-in-chatgpt/\">study mode for ChatGPT</a>, indicating that companies are ramping up competition in the AI education sector.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company also said it has taken down over 6.8 million WhatsApp accounts linked to criminal scam centers targeting people around the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new features are designed to help detect scams in both group and individual chats on the Meta-owned platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For group chats, WhatsApp is launching a safety overview feature that will be displayed when someone who isn’t in your contact list adds you to a new group that you may not recognize. The safety overview will include key information about the group, alongside tips to stay safe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, you will see if the person who added you is one of your contacts, and if any member of the group is a contact of yours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you decide that you might recognize the group, you can choose to see the chat for more context. Either way, notifications from the chat will be muted until you mark that you want to remain in the group.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034156\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png 1636w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=768,673 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=680,596 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=1200,1052 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=1280,1122 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=430,377 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=720,631 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=900,789 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=800,701 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=1536,1346 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=668,586 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=428,375 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=704,617 704w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=606,531 606w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-05-at-10.20.23AM.png?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>WhatsApp</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for individual chats, WhatsApp notes that scammers might try to start conversations with you elsewhere on the internet before asking to message on private messaging services like WhatsApp. To protect against this tactic, the app is testing new ways to alert people before they start talking to someone who could be trying to scam them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, it’s working to caution users when they start a chat with someone not in their contacts by showing them additional context about who they’re messaging.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp also shared information about how it worked alongside OpenAI to disrupt scam efforts that were traced back to a scam center in Cambodia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These attempts ranged from offering payments for fake likes to enlisting others into a rent-a-scooter pyramid scheme, or luring people to invest in cryptocurrency,” WhatsApp explained in a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/08/new-whatsapp-tools-tips-beat-messaging-scams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As OpenAI reported, the scammers used ChatGPT to generate the initial text message containing a link to a WhatsApp chat, and then quickly directed the target to Telegram, where they were assigned a task of liking videos on TikTok. The scammers attempted to build trust in their scheme by sharing how much the target has already ‘earned’ in theory, before asking them to deposit money into a crypto account as the next task.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp says users can protect themselves from scams by taking time before responding to think about whether the message reads like a legitimate task. They should then question if the request makes sense and if they’re rushing you into taking action. If they’re claiming to be a friend or family member, you should use another method of communication to verify their identity.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, the specifics of these tariffs remain unclear.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such tariffs could cause quite a disruption for U.S. hardware and AI companies.

It’s not specific to any particular environment. It can generate both photo-realistic and imaginary worlds, and everything in between.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still in research preview and not publicly available, Genie 3 builds on both its predecessor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/deepminds-genie-2-can-generate-interactive-worlds-that-look-like-video-games/\">Genie 2</a> (which can generate new environments for agents) and DeepMind’s latest video generation model <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/google-rolls-out-its-new-veo-3-video-generation-model-globally/\">Veo 3</a> (which is said to have a deep understanding of physics). </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Real-time-Interactivity.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034135\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google DeepMind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a simple text prompt, Genie 3 can generate multiple minutes of interactive 3D environments at 720p resolution at 24 frames per second — a significant jump from the 10 to 20 seconds Genie 2 could produce. The model also features “promptable world events,” or the ability to use a prompt to change the generated world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps most importantly, Genie 3’s simulations stay physically consistent over time because the model can remember what it previously generated — a capability that DeepMind says its researchers didn’t explicitly program into the model. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fruchter said that while Genie 3 has implications for educational experiences, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/could-googles-veo-3-be-the-start-of-playable-world-models/\">gaming</a> or prototyping creative concepts, its real unlock will manifest in training agents for general-purpose tasks, which he said is essential to reaching AGI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think world models are key on the path to AGI, specifically for embodied agents, where simulating real world scenarios is particularly challenging,” Jack Parker-Holder, a research scientist on DeepMind’s open-endedness team, said during the briefing.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prompt-to-World.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034136\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google DeepMind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Genie 3 is supposedly designed to solve that bottleneck. Like Veo, it doesn’t rely on a hard-coded physics engine; instead, DeepMind says, the model teaches itself how the world works — how objects move, fall, and interact — by remembering what it has generated and reasoning over long time horizons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The model is auto-regressive, meaning it generates one frame at a time,” Fruchter told TechCrunch in an interview. “It has to look back at what was generated before to decide what’s going to happen next. That’s a key part of the architecture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That memory, the company says, lends to consistency in Genie 3’s simulated worlds, which in turn allows it to develop a grasp of physics, similar to how humans understand that a glass teetering on the edge of a table is about to fall, or that they should duck to avoid a falling object.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, DeepMind says the model also has the potential to push AI agents to their limits — forcing them to learn from their own experience, similar to how humans learn in the real world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an example, DeepMind shared its test of Genie 3 with a recent version of its generalist <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent (SIMA)</a>, instructing it to pursue a set of goals. In a warehouse setting, they asked the agent to perform tasks like “approach the bright green trash compactor” or “walk to the packed red forklift.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In all three cases, the SIMA agent is able to achieve the goal,” Parker-Holder said. “It just receives the actions from the agent. So the agent takes the goal, sees the world simulated around it, and then takes the actions in the world. Genie 3 simulates forward, and the fact that it’s able to achieve it is because Genie 3 remains consistent.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prompt-Event.gif?w=480\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034137\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google DeepMind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Genie 3 has its limitations. For example, while the researchers claim it can understand physics, the demo showing a skier barreling down a mountain didn’t reflect how snow would move in relation to the skier. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the range of actions an agent can take is limited. For example, the prompt-able world events allow for a wide range of environmental interventions, but they’re not necessarily performed by the agent itself. And it’s still difficult to accurately model complex interactions between multiple independent agents in a shared environment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Genie 3 can also only support a few minutes of continuous interaction, when hours would be necessary for proper training. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the model presents a compelling step forward in teaching agents to go beyond reacting to inputs, letting them potentially plan, explore, seek out uncertainty, and improve through trial and error – the kind of self-driven, embodied learning that many say is key to moving towards general intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We haven’t really had a Move 37 moment for embodied agents yet, where they can actually take novel actions in the real world,” Parker-Holder said, referring to the legendary moment in the 2016 game of Go between DeepMind’s AI agent AlphaGo and world champion Lee Sedol, in which Alpha Go played an unconventional and brilliant move that became symbolic of AI’s ability to discover new strategies beyond human understanding. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But now, we can potentially usher in a new era,” he said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify is expanding access to its audiobooks to more U.S. subscribers. The company on Tuesday announced the launch of its $11.99 per month Audiobooks+ plan in the market, which allows subscribers or their household members on a Family or Duo plan to add 15 hours of audiobook listening during the month on top of the base plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Spotify <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/spotify-brings-audiobooks-to-u-s-users-with-a-catalog-of-300000-titles-to-start/\">launched</a> its audiobooks service in the U.S. back in 2022, household members on Duo and Family plans have long been left out. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The offering makes audiobooks available to household members for the first time in the U.S. market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through Spotify Premium, subscribers already have access to 15 hours of audiobook listening per month and can buy additional hours to top off that, as needed. However, the Audiobooks+ plan gives subscribers the option to add on recurring access to 15 additional hours every month, on top of the Premium plan’s existing monthly allotment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While that may be overkill for any but the more voracious audiobook listeners, the U.S. rollout of Audiobooks+ also means that other members on a subscription plan besides the cardholder can now also access Spotify’s audiobooks catalog for the first time. This is made possible through the add-on called “Audiobooks+ for Plan Members.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the launch, the U.S. joins a handful of other markets with access to Audiobooks+, including Ireland, Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg\" alt=\"a photo containing three screenshots of the Audiobooks+ feature in Spotify on iOS.\" class=\"wp-image-3034106\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1200,683 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1280,729 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=430,245 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=720,410 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=900,513 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=800,456 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1536,875 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=668,380 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=659,375 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1084,617 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=708,403 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement of the plan’s expansion to the U.S. comes shortly after a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/spotify-spot-stock-q2-2025-earnings.html\">tough quarter</a> for the streaming giant, where it missed expectations and reported weak guidance. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek pointed to a weaker ads business as the cause. (Spotify’s ads chief had just left for DoorDash, media outlets reported ahead of earnings.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the loss, one bright spot for the company in the quarter was its user growth. Active users grew 11% to 696 million, and paid subscribers grew 12% to 276 million during the second quarter. The goal with the new Audiobooks+ plan is to extract more money from those existing customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, publisher HarperCollins teased a solution for the problem with household members’ inability to access audiobooks. HarperCollins CEO Brian Murray said at the time that Spotify was working to adjust a “technical problem” with family plans that limited audiobook streaming only to the family plan’s credit card holder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, Spotify made good on that promise when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/spotify-expands-audiobook-access-to-family-plan-members-for-the-first-time/\">expanded</a> audiobook access to plan members for the first time with the launch of Audibooks+ in several non-U.S. markets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify doesn’t share how many of its Premium subscribers stream audiobooks in addition to music or podcasts, but notes that audiobook listening hours are up more than 35% year-over-year in the U.S., U.K., and Australia. Notably, that’s before these add-on plans became available. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news of the new subscription follows Spotify’s announcement on Monday that its subscription prices are increasing from €10,99 to €11,99 across markets in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify says it will experiment with other options for book fans in the future, including direct sales.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said it is “actively investigating these incidents to determine whether they are connected to a previously disclosed vulnerability or if a new vulnerability may be responsible.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s alert comes as security researchers say they have identified hackers targeting SonicWall devices to gain initial access to a victim’s network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hackers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/a-brief-history-of-mass-hacks/\">increasingly targeting enterprise products</a>, like firewalls and VPNs, which work as digital gatekeepers, allowing legitimate employees access to the company’s network. But security flaws in these products can allow malicious hackers in, enabling attackers to launch data-stealing or destructive attacks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Security firm Arctic Wolf <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/arctic-wolf-observes-july-2025-uptick-in-akira-ransomware-activity-targeting-sonicwall-ssl-vpn/\">said it has seen intrusions</a> targeting SonicWall customers as far back as mid-July. The company said “available evidence points to the existence of a zero-day vulnerability,” referring to a security bug that was discovered and exploited before the vendor could patch the issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers said they witnessed a short gap between the exploitation of the SonicWall firewall and the subsequent deployment of file-encrypting malware, or ransomware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huntress Labs, another cybersecurity firm, said it <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/exploitation-of-sonicwall-vpn\">is “likely” that a zero-day bug in SonicWall firewalls is to blame</a> for the attacks, and warned that the hackers exploiting the bug have been seen gaining access to a company’s domain controllers, which manages the devices and users on that network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its blog, Huntress said it believes the Akira ransomware gang is behind some of the attacks targeting SonicWall customers. Akira has been known to target enterprise products, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/hackers-are-exploiting-a-new-fortinet-firewall-bug-to-breach-company-networks/\">like Fortinet firewalls</a>, to break into large networks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a critical, ongoing threat,” wrote Huntress.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This forced Duraisamy to cover significant travel expenses out of pocket and file endless expense reports. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was a constant pain,” Duraisamy explained on the call. “I’d spend my weekends uploading receipts, reconciling every expense manually.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Alaan, the company he launched with fellow McKinsey alumnus <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ae.linkedin.com/in/karun-kurien-3020504b\">Karun Kurien</a>, is the Middle East’s leading spend management platform. It just announced that it raised $48 million in Series A funding led by Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India &amp; SEA) with participation from others like founders of 885 Capital, Y Combinator, 468 Capital, and Pioneer Fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders of some of Alaan’s unicorn customers, like Hosam Arab (Tabby), Mudassir Sheikha (Careem), and Khalid Al Ameri, a well-known YouTuber in the region, also invested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is one of the largest Series A rounds for a fintech in the region, compared to Saudi Arabia’s buy now, pay later platform Tamara, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tamara.co/en-SA/press-release-2\">which raised $110 million</a> a couple of years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The category has demonstrated strong product-market fit in the MENA region, and Alaan stands out as the category leader,” said GV Ravishankar, Managing Director at Peak XV. “Their customer-centric and product-led mindset has enabled them to build solutions tailored to modern finance teams.” (Peak XV also participated in a large Series B round last month, backing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/uae-proptech-huspy-raises-59m-to-scale-in-europe/\">UAE’s proptech Huspy</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alaan’s path to category leadership wasn’t without challenges, however.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the fintech raised a $2.5 million seed round in mid-2021, it couldn’t launch for nearly a year, largely due to regulatory complexities and the need for banking partnerships in the UAE. Its recent expansion into Saudi Arabia posed similar hurdles, taking years to secure approvals from the country’s apex bank before finally launching this January. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The biggest challenge we faced, both in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, was simply going live,” the CEO shared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet, Duraisamy said the fintech was able to move fast in other ways such as in Alaan’s pioneering move to integrate Apple Pay into its B2B offerings, something previously unavailable to finance teams in the region. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early 2023, the company also claimed to be the first in the Middle East to integrate OpenAI into its services, a move Duraisamy says shaped the company’s current product strategy. Initially, Alaan rolled out a chatbot, anticipating that users would enjoy conversational interactions around their spending. But the feature failed to gain traction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lesson learned, the fintech shifted focus, realizing customers got more value when AI worked in the background. Alaan began using AI to help streamline  processes like receipt matching, reconciliation, and VAT extraction—a particularly valuable use case in the region, where the platform helps businesses navigate complex VAT regulations and reclaimable tax.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims its spend management platform has already saved finance teams more than 1.5 million hours of manual work. Its a number Alaan expects to grow as it continues to invest in automation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching in 2022, Alaan has processed over 2.5 million transactions for more than 1,500 finance teams across major regional enterprises, including G42, Careem, Tabby, and Lulu Group.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, the company is profitable, Duraisamy says, noting that it spent $5 million to generate $10 million in revenue. Duraisamy credits YC and his mentors for instilling a disciplined approach in a market where many fintechs are focused on payment volumes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Alaan is looking to replicate its growth in Saudi Arabia, where it launched earlier this year and has been doubling transaction volumes month over month for the past six months, according to the startup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series A will accelerate this expansion, allowing the company to scale hiring across sales, customer success, and compliance, while also doubling down on AI-driven finance automation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the four-year-old fintech, which is equipping MENA finance teams with AI agents, has now raised one of the largest Series A rounds in MENA, I asked Duraisamy if Ramp’s explosive growth—its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/ramp-hits-22-5b-valuation-just-45-days-after-reaching-16b/\">valuation has doubled this year after raising three rounds</a>—played a role in investors betting big on Alaan.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you talk to investors, what really matters for a company at our stage is the fundamentals: how capital-efficient we are, how much revenue we generate, how strong our go-to-market motion is,” he said. “We are not in a market where you know size is an advantage, like the US or Europe. So, regardless of whether Ramp was able to raise or not, I think we would have raised this much because our fundamentals were very strong.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In the first half of 2025 alone, the startup recorded $250 million in gross merchandise value (GMV), up nearly 1.5 times year-over-year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its digital banking arm, Uzum Bank, launched a co-branded Visa debit card with pre-approved credit limits in August last year. That product has already issued 2 million cards and is on track to surpass 5 million by year-end.

He believes that understanding the country’s culture, consumer behavior, and business environment — and pairing that with the technical and operational expertise that global companies have developed — has been critical to building a business that can scale quickly and sustainably.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built its digital and physical infrastructure from scratch to kick off its business in Uzbekistan.

It has since expanded to include fulfillment-by-seller and delivery-by-seller options, with a goal of routing 20–30% of deliveries through these new models. These new delivery models will also help Uzum expand its stock-keeping units, which are currently over 1.5 million available for its next-day delivery service, up from over 600,000 SKUs at the time of its last funding announcement in March 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked what brought Tencent onto its cap-table this time, Uzum’s chief strategy and business development officer, Nikolay Seleznev, told TechCrunch the startup’s strong growth metrics convinced the Chinese investor to come on board after several quarters of ongoing discussions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uzum plans to grow its fintech business by introducing a deposit product in September and a long-term (more than 12 months in maturity) credit facility for its B2C customers. The startup also plans to expand its merchant base and help its existing and new merchants with its QR code payment processing system, expand its Visa debit card program, and build new products to support small and medium enterprises in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, the startup plans to introduce new products adding value-added services to its e-commerce business, including those helping to generate advertisement revenues. It is also working toward scaling its financial infrastructure further with AI increasingly embedded across credit scoring, fraud protection, and personalized user experiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Furthermore, Uzum plans to open up its e-commerce marketplace for international merchants, beginning with those in China and Turkey in September.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are expecting 10 to 15% of cross-border activity coming from these countries,” Seleznev said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has over 12,000 people in its workforce, including blue-collar workers at its pickup points, as well as tech, engineering, and product teams across all its business verticals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to other businesses of its sort, which are profitable and have multiple avenues to generate continuous income over time, Uzum has plans to become public in the medium term. But before that, it aims to raise a Series B round of $250–$300 million in the first half of 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the startup has so far raised $137 million in equity, including the latest round.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With the infusion of the new capital, Jeh Aerospace has raised about $15 million in total from institutional venture capital firms. The VC fresh funding comes less than a month after the startup received an undisclosed strategic investment from IndiGo Ventures, a corporate venture capital arm of Indian carrier IndiGo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ashray Iyengar, principal at Elevation Capital, said the company “built a truly differentiated approach to aerospace manufacturing.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-aircraft-production-bottleneck\">Aircraft production bottleneck</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global air traffic demand rose 10.4% year-over-year in 2024, surpassing 2019 levels by 3.8%, per the International Air Transport Association data <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2025-releases/2025-01-30-01/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released</a> earlier this year. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rebound has spurred airlines to expand fleets, pushing up orders even as the industry grapples with talent and production bottlenecks, as Deloitte <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">notes</a> in a recent report.

Sanghavi said each of these customers is a “high dollar, high ARR customer,” and they have the potential to become large accounts in the next one to two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we believe is that to work with lesser, but better customers, not to have a transactional relationship, but a far deeper and meaningful relationship. So, we are also very, very focused on not having too many customers,” he said. “The business doesn’t need too many customers because you can really scale with few customers very fast and very quickly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also assembled an advisory team with deep ties to commercial aircraft OEMS. The startup counts former Boeing India president Pratyush (Prat) Kumar and former Airbus India CEO and managing director Dwaraka Srinivasan among its early advisers and backers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jeh Aerospace has made notable manufacturing and financial progress in its short life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its $2.75 million seed round in January last year, Jeh Aerospace says it has delivered more than 100,000 flight-critical components and tools on time. The startup has also established a machine capacity exceeding 250,000 hours annually.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the last financial year, the startup reached $6 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and achieved profitability after taxes.

Starting in September 2024, Dribbble began pivoting to a marketplace that connected designers and clients. Designers could communicate freely on the platform and then either share a 3.5% revenue cut on clients they converted, or they could pay for <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Pro subscription</a> to skip the rev share. In March, the company tightened the rules further, saying that anyone finding clients on Dribbble would need to offer the platform a cut of their revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It went from it was optional to use our transactional features to it was required for non-advertisers to use our transactional features, if they were on Dribbble, to find clients,” explains <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/canastasakis/\">Dribbble CEO </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/canastasakis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Constantine Anastasakis</a>, in an interview with TechCrunch. “If a user is on Dribbble to find inspiration or to get feedback on their work, or to talk shop with their peers, none of this affects them,” he added.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033928\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg 3378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1200,629 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1280,671 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=720,377 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=900,472 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=800,419 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1536,805 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=2048,1073 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=668,350 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1178,617 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=708,371 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Dribbble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec, who joined the company after working at direct-to-consumer lender Lower, video marketplace Pond5 (exited to Shutterstock), and freelancer marketplace Fiverr, was hired last April to pivot Dribbble into a marketplace. While the company is profitable under parent company <a href=\"https://www.tiny.com/companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tiny</a>, it’s still a small 20-person team and isn’t reliant on venture backing to serve its 7.5 to 10 million monthly unique visitors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Dribbble was something that really accelerated our business dramatically back in the day,” Kuznetsov told TechCrunch. Before Dribbble, there was no platform where designers could share their work with others, he says. It helped designers receive feedback that came specifically from their peers and allowed newer designers to learn from those at the top of the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov is now part of the latter group. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Milkinside, Kuznetsov has worked with companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Scandinavian Airlines, United Airlines, Honda, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, and other large companies in the Bay Area. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, he likely didn’t feel that Dribbble would risk banning him for not abiding by the new terms. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anastasakis essentially confirmed this to be true. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He told TechCrunch that Kuznetsov received 83 work inquiries since the new terms rolled out in March, and responded to 61. In each message, the site shows a warning that reminds users that contact details should not be shared before project payment. However, Kuznetsov shared his contact information in six messages, which would have displayed a stronger warning at that time. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

about his repeated terms-of-service violations, which informed him he was risking permanent suspension.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov told us he didn’t see this email initially, but Dribbble says it tracked that the email was opened three times before his suspension. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe that Dribbble — it was their goal to hurt me so I can spread that [news] so they can give a harsh lesson to everyone who tries [to break the rules],” Kuznetsov says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anastasakis confirmed as much to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s really no conceivable way in which he did not realize that what he was doing risked permanent suspension of his accounts,” Anastasakis told us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that ultimately it was that he believed that we wouldn’t take action against a designer of his caliber,” he continued. “As a side note, I actually think that he’s done us a big favor as far as getting the word out about how seriously we take the terms.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Kuznetsov, or any designer who was banned for similar reasons, the only option to come back to Dribbble is by joining as an advertiser, which requires a minimum campaign budget of $1,500 per month for at least three months. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-competitor-to-dribbble-emerges\">A new competitor to Dribbble emerges?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov has decided to forge his own path, saying that he’s hurt by Dribbble’s change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not going to be a copycat of Dribbble,” he says of his pending startup. Instead, it will be a resource for designers that will also leverage AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there has been a lot of backlash about AI models training on creatives’ work without compensation, Kuznetsov believes there’s a use case for the technology in terms of inspiration, creation, and design. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1826250\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg 6555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Gleb Kuznetsov</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a big hole right now in the market … Everybody’s doing AI startups, but nobody’s really doing AI startups for designers,” Kuznetsov notes. “AI is something that really can elevate our ability to create, and make it on a much higher level of quality.

But the simple fact that Big Sleep found these vulnerabilities is significant, as it shows these tools are starting to get real results, even if there was a human involved in this case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To ensure high quality and actionable reports, we have a human expert in the loop before reporting, but each vulnerability was found and reproduced by the AI agent without human intervention,” Google’s spokesperson Kimberly Samra told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Royal Hansen, Google’s vice president of engineering, <a href=\"https://x.com/royalhansen/status/1952424018663162235\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote on X</a> that the findings demonstrate “a new frontier in automated vulnerability discovery.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LLM-powered tools that can look for and find vulnerabilities <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/ai-slop-and-fake-reports-are-exhausting-some-security-bug-bounties/\">are already a reality</a>. Other than Big Sleep, there’s <a href=\"https://www.runsybil.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">RunSybil</a> and XBOW, among others. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">XBOW has garnered headlines after <a href=\"https://xbow.com/blog/top-1-how-xbow-did-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it reached the top</a> of one of the U.S. leaderboards at bug bounty platform HackerOne. It’s important to note that in most cases, these reports have a human at some point of the process to verify that the AI-powered bug hunter found a legitimate vulnerability, as is the case with Big Sleep.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vlad Ionescu, co-founder and chief technology officer at RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch that Big Sleep is a “legit” project, given that it has “good design, people behind it know what they’re doing, Project Zero has the bug finding experience and DeepMind has the firepower and tokens to throw at it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is obviously a lot of promise with these tools, but also significant downsides. Several people who maintain different software projects have complained of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/ai-slop-and-fake-reports-are-exhausting-some-security-bug-bounties/\">bug reports that are actually hallucinations</a>, with some calling them the bug bounty equivalent of AI slop. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s the problem people are running into, is we’re getting a lot of stuff that looks like gold, but it’s actually just crap,” Ionescu previously told TechCrunch.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The iPhone-maker once promised to build a giant LCD factory in Wisconsin — a project that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called the “eighth wonder of the world” during his first term</a> — and wound up underdelivering to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/12/nx-s1-5359422/what-wisconsins-foxconn-plant-can-tell-us-about-the-future-of-manufacturing-in-the-u-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an extreme degree</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn says the buyer is an “existing business partner” named “Crescent Dune LLC,” an entity that was created in Delaware just 12 days ago, according to records filed with the state. Matt Dewine, a spokesperson for Foxconn, declined to say more about the buyer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn sold the factory and land for around $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million, Taiwan stock exchange filings show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Foxconn representative told <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/an-foxconn-sells-lordstown-plant-hon-hai-ev-taiwan-0804/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Automotive News</a> the company will remain “involved in the manufacturing of products for customers at the Lordstown facility” and claimed it is “committed to customers and suppliers” in the automotive industry. But The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/lordstown-ev-plant-to-be-converted-into-ai-hardware-factory-849eadfa?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiFSyhoRht1TX_V-H1hGJ-jYkL4PNPMup93UlW2B1LohiFNj2V8HlnJY-DNsiA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689100d9&amp;gaa_sig=b44CP77AVuyIDZIOMSJofm2H-hAYI5BihC3_VZ0kzZ_wOmAZt2UOE4hq7xWWnrVET72dkBxzBZpZWMX13qIzsQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported Monday</a> that Foxconn now plans to build AI servers at the factory. Dewine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn announced the deal to buy the former GM plant in 2021 for $230 million, when it was still owned by EV startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said it was going to be the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&amp;D hub in North America.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Foxconn was developing EVs of its own in Asia, it was also focused on contract manufacturing in the United States. And, in short order, three of the electric vehicle companies Foxconn hoped would occupy the factory went bankrupt.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn actually built a few EVs at the factory for the now-defunct Lordstown Motors. But the Taiwanese electronics giant wound up in a bitter fight with that troubled EV startup. Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy in June 2023, and accused Foxconn — which had become an investor in the startup — of “starving it of cash,” and said it “maliciously and in bad faith destroyed that business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn also took a flier on a small EV startup called IndiEV, claiming it would build its electric SUV at the Ohio factory. IndiEV filed for bankruptcy in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-03/second-us-foxconn-ev-customer-files-for-bankruptcy-protection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">October 2023</a> with less than $3 million in the bank. Foxconn was supposed to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/foxconn-will-build-evs-for-lordstown-motors-and-fisker-at-ohio-plant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">build EVs for Fisker Inc.</a> as well. Fisker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/fisker-bankruptcy-failure-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed for bankruptcy in June 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A fourth company, Monarch Tractor, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/monarch-tractor-lays-off-10-in-restructuring-towards-software-and-licensing-av-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not had much of an impact</a>, with Foxconn making no more than a few hundred electric tractors. Monarch’s CEO, Praveen Penmetsa, did not respond to an emailed request for comment about whether its tractors will continue to be built in Ohio.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
