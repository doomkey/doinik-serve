The judges repeatedly asked the company how users can meaningfully consent to data-sharing practices in a market where the app is pretty much the default communications platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With more than 500 million users, India is WhatsApp’s largest market and a key growth area for Meta’s advertising business. Judges in the case question the potential commercial value of metadata generated by the platform, and how such data could be monetized across Meta’s wider advertising and AI functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the hearing, Chief Justice Surya Kant said the Supreme Court would not allow Meta and WhatsApp to share even “a single piece of information” while the appeal was pending, arguing that users faced little real choice in accepting WhatsApp’s privacy policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling the messaging service a monopoly in practice, Kant questioned how “a poor woman selling fruits on the street” or a domestic worker could be expected to grasp how their data was being used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other judges also pressed Meta on how user data was analyzed beyond message content. Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the court wanted to examine the commercial value of behavioral data and how it was used for targeted advertising, arguing that even anonymized or siloed information carried economic worth. Government lawyers added that personal data was not only collected but also commercially exploited.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s lawyers said the platform’s messages are end-to-end encrypted and inaccessible even to the company, arguing that the privacy policy in question did not weaken user protections or allow chat content to be used for advertising.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case stems from a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2021 update</a> to WhatsApp’s privacy policy that required users in India to accept broader data-sharing terms with Meta or stop using the service. India’s competition regulator later imposed a ₹2.13 billion (around $23.6 million) penalty, finding that the policy abused WhatsApp’s dominant position in the messaging market. That ruling was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/22/whatsapp-wins-reprieve-in-india-over-user-data-sharing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">upheld</a> on appeal before Meta and WhatsApp moved the Supreme Court to challenge it. Meta’s lawyers told the court the penalty had already been paid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Supreme Court has adjourned the matter until February 9, allowing Meta and WhatsApp to explain their data practices in greater detail. At the suggestion of the competition regulator, the court also agreed to add the IT ministry as a party to the case, widening the scope of the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta declined to comment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp has been facing heightened scrutiny over its  data privacy across the world. Authorities in the U.S. have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/us-has-investigated-claims-that-whatsapp-chats-aren-t-private\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">examined claims</a> that WhatsApp chats may not be as private as the company asserts, adding to broader questions about how encrypted messaging platforms handle user data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In India, WhatsApp is also navigating new regulatory constraints, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/14/whatsapps-biggest-market-is-becoming-its-toughest-test/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent SIM-binding rules</a> aimed at curbing fraud, which could limit how widely small businesses use the messaging service.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Vema then draws the hydrogen to the surface and sells it to industrial users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To supply the Quebec local market, which is about 100,000 tons per year, you would need 3 square kilometers, which is nothing,” Pierre Levin, CEO of Vema, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vema’s first pilot well will produce several tons of hydrogen per day, and next year, it plans to drill its first commercial well, which will reach 800 meters into the Earth. Vema expects to produce hydrogen from the first wells for less than $1 per kilogram, a widely used benchmark for clean hydrogen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most hydrogen today is made by a process known as steam reformation of methane (SMR), in which steam is used to break hydrogen molecules off methane from natural gas. It’s energy intensive, and both the process to make steam and the chemical reaction itself release carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Less polluting sources of hydrogen exist, but they tend to cost more. Hydrogen from SMR costs between 70 cents and $1.60 per kilogram, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-average-levelised-cost-of-hydrogen-production-by-energy-source-and-technology-2019-and-2050\">according</a> to the IEA. Capturing carbon from SMR can add around 50% to those prices, while the cleanest process, which uses zero carbon electricity to power an electrolyzer, drives costs up several fold.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stimulated geologic hydrogen, or “engineered mineral hydrogen,” as Vema calls it, promises to be one of the cleanest sources of hydrogen, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Insight-169-Stimulated-Geologic-Hydrogen-Production.pdf\">according</a> to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once Vema has refined its techniques, Levin expects it to produce hydrogen for less than 50 cents per kilogram. At that price, Vema’s hydrogen would be cheaper than any other source on the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the rocks that Vema is targeting are widely distributed, Levin said the company will drill wells close to companies that need power, including data centers. California, for example, has some of the largest formations of ophiolite, an iron-rich type of rock that was pushed up from the ocean bottom by plate tectonics. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Vema can deliver hydrogen at the price it’s forecasting, then a quirk of geology could turn California into a mecca for data centers. “You have a ton of data centers who are trying to get some baseline, decarbonized electricity,” Levin said. “We have very strong traction with them.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Avalanche co-founder and CEO Robin Langtry thinks smaller is better. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the last several years, Langtry and his colleagues at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.avalanchefusion.com/\">Avalanche</a> have been working on what’s essentially a desktop version of nuclear fusion. “We’re using the small size to learn quickly and iterate quickly,” Langtry told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion power promises to supply the world with large amounts of clean heat and electricity, if researchers and engineers can solve some vexing challenges. At its core, fusion power seeks to harness the power of the Sun. To do that, fusion startups must figure out how to heat and compress plasma for long enough that atoms inside the mix fuse, releasing energy in the process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion is a famously unforgiving industry. The physics is challenging, the materials science is cutting edge, and the power requirements can be gargantuan. Parts need to be machined with precision, and the scale is usually so large as to obviate rapid fire experimentation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) are using large magnets to contain the plasma in a doughnut-like tokamak, others are compressing fuel pellets by shooting them with powerful lasers. Avalanche, though, uses electric current at extremely high voltages to draw plasma particles into an orbit around an electrode. (It also uses some magnets to keep things orderly, though they’re not nearly as powerful as a tokamak’s.) As the orbit tightens and the plasmas speed up, the particles begin to smash into each other and fuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The approach has won over some investors. Avalanche recently added another $29 million in an investment round led by R.A. Capital Management with participation from 8090 Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Founders Fund, Lowercarbon Capital, Overlay Capital, and Toyota Ventures. To date, the company has raised $80 million from investors, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">relatively small amount in the fusion world</a>. Other companies have raised several hundred to a few billion dollars. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-space-based-inspiration\">Space-based inspiration</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Langtry’s time at the Jeff Bezos-backed space tech company Blue Origin influenced how Avalanche is tackling the problem. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve figured out that using this sort of SpaceX ‘new space’ approach is that you can iterate really quickly, you can learn really quickly, and you can solve some of these challenges.” said Langtry, who worked with co-founder Brian Riordan at Blue Origin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Going smaller allowed Avalanche to speed up. The company has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/avalanche-energy-hits-key-milestone-on-the-road-to-a-desktop-fusion-reactor/\">testing changes</a> to its devices “sometimes twice a week,” something that would be challenging and costly with a large device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Avalanche’s reactor is only nine centimeters in diameter, though Langtry said a new version grow to 25 centimeters and is expected to produce about 1 megawatt. That, he said, “is going to give us a significant bump in confinement time, and that’s how we’re actually going to get plasmas that have a chance of being Q&gt;1.” (In fusion, Q refers to the ratio of power in to power out. When it’s greater than one, the fusion device is said to be past the breakeven point.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those experiments will be carried out at Avalanche’s FusionWERX, a commercial testing facility the company also rents out to competitors. By 2027, the site will be licensed to handle tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that’s used as fuel and is crucial to many fusion startup’s plans for producing power for the grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Langtry wouldn’t commit to a date when he hopes Avalanche will be able to generate more power than its fusion devices consume, a key milestone in the industry. But he’s thinks the company is on a similar timeline as competitors like CFS and the Sam Altman-backed Helion. “I think there’s going to be a lot of really exciting things happening in fusion in 2027 to 2029,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company was founded in 2022, and offers participating firms the opportunity to earn ongoing revenue streams via partner affiliate sales, Axios <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/fintech-deals/2024/11/19/rewards-startup-kalder-seed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Güven was featured in last year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 list.

Other brands “had no agreement with Kalder whatsoever—not even for free services,” officials said in a press release announcing the indictment. The pitch deck also “falsely reported that Kalder’s recurring revenue had steadily grown month over month since February 2023 and that by March 2024, Kalder had reached $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also accuses Güven of having kept two separate sets of financial books. One of those sets included “false and inflated numbers,” and was presented to investors or potential investors to hide the “true financial condition of the company,” the government claims. The DOJ also alleges that Güven used lies about Kalder as well as forged documents to obtain a category of visa reserved for individuals of “extraordinary ability,” that would allow her to live and work in the United States. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch reached out to Güven through her personal website.

Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round also included significant investments from Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala Capital, as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Additional investors included BDT &amp; MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said the funds will be used to fuel its growth, which has accelerated over the past year and doesn’t appear to be slowing. The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-sfo-airport-robotaxis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recently secured rides</a> to and from San Francisco International Airport and has expanded its robotaxi service throughout Northern California and several major metropolitan areas in the U.S., including Los Angeles, Austin, and Miami.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, the former Google self-driving project slowly progressed forward, testing its autonomous vehicle tech on public roads in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area and providing the occasional public or media demo. In 2016, it made its first geographic leap forward and began testing in Phoenix, where it eventually pulled its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/18/waymo-is-expanding-its-driverless-program-in-phoenix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">human safety driver</a> out of the vehicles. Phoenix became Waymo’s first robotaxi market, in which the public could hail driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo pushed down the accelerator in August 2023 after receiving the final necessary permit to operate a robotaxi service — and charge for rides — in California. It launched a limited service in San Francisco, later expanding to much of the greater Bay Area, Silicon Valley, and more recently to the freeways that connect the dozens of towns in the area. It also expanded to Los Angeles. The company launched in Austin and Atlanta in 2025 through a partnership with Uber.

Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” he wrote. (xAI has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/memphis-xai-colossus-elon-musk-chamber-messaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">imposing some of that hardship</a> on the communities near its data centers in Memphis, Tennessee.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up values the combined company at $1.25 trillion, according to Bloomberg News, which was first to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/elon-musk-s-spacex-said-to-combine-with-xai-ahead-of-mega-ipo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report the completed deal</a>.

It’s unclear whether the merger will affect that timeline. Musk did not address the IPO in his public memo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The merger brings together two of Musk’s companies, each with its own financial challenges. xAI is currently burning around $1 billion per month, according to Bloomberg. SpaceX, meanwhile, generates as much as 80% of its revenue from launching its own Starlink satellites, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/spacex-generated-about-8-billion-profit-last-year-ahead-ipo-sources-say-2026-01-30/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Reuters</a>.

(That revenue loop likely looks even more attractive when you consider that satellites are required to be de-orbited every five years by the Federal Communications Commission.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While space data centers may be the stated goal, SpaceX and xAI have very different near-term objectives. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX is currently trying to prove that its Starship rocket is capable of bringing astronauts to the moon and Mars, while xAI is competing with leading artificial intelligence companies like Google and OpenAI.

The new rules, which go in effect January 1, 2027, will prohibit the hidden, electronically actuated door handles popularized by Tesla — and now found on numerous other electric vehicles in China.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new rule dictates that each door (excluding the tailgate) should be equipped with a mechanically released external door handle. Vehicles must also have a mechanical release on the interior of the vehicle. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/china-bans-hidden-car-door-handles-in-world-first-safety-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously reported</a> on the new safety policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Numerous high-profile fatal incidents, in which occupants have become trapped in their vehicles, have raised concerns among safety regulators and advocates globally. China is the first country to issue a ban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-dangerous-doors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investigation by Bloomberg</a> last September uncovered problems with the concealed door handles on Tesla vehicles, citing several crashes in which first responders or occupants were unable to open the doors because the electronic door locks weren’t getting enough power from the vehicle’s battery system to work properly. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration then opened a <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE25010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">defect investigation</a> into certain Tesla Model Y and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-24/tesla-faces-new-nhtsa-probe-over-model-3-emergency-door-handles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Model 3</a> door handles. While Tesla does have manual releases inside its vehicles, federal investigators noted that the releases can be hard for children to access, and many owners are unaware of their existence. Some U.S. lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/us-lawmaker-readies-bill-requiring-manual-door-handles-in-cars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">proposed regulation</a> requiring manual door releases in all new vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fatal incidents in China, including a crash involving a Xiaomi SU7 electric sedan, prompted regulators there to propose changes to EV door handles last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Chinese government began the process in May 2025 with more than 40 domestic vehicle manufacturers, parts suppliers, and testing institutions participating in the initial research. More than 100 industry experts held multiple rounds of discussions to determine the standard framework and form a draft standard of what would become the <a href=\"https://std.samr.gov.cn/gb/search/gbDetailed?id=4984F354F9F8CAD1E06397BE0A0AA46C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Safety Technical Requirements for Automobile Door Handles</a> rule, according to the Chinese government’s standards agency.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That included dozens of automakers, including Chinese companies such as BYD, Geely Holdings, SAIC, and Xiaomi, as well as foreign automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Hyundai, Nissan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.

On Monday, Adobe issued an <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/release-notes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">update</a> to the company’s support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing Adobe Animate will be discontinued on March 1, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprise customers can continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition. Other customers will have support through March of next year, the company said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision has been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1qu41ca/adobe_is_planning_to_discontinue_animate_next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">met</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=adobe%20animate&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with</a> incredulity, disappointment, and anger among Adobe Animate users, who are concerned about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One customer, <a href=\"https://x.com/TylerGlaiel/status/2018394595340771653\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posting on X</a>, pleaded with Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things <a href=\"https://x.com/ThisIsWronchi/status/2018404802510630914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like</a> “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” <a href=\"https://x.com/Ari4472/status/2018406974589722819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and</a> “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/animate/kb/end-of-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FAQ</a>, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reading between the lines, it sounds as if Adobe is saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s surprising is that Adobe can’t even recommend software that will fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it says customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, it suggests that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction after Animate was ignored at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software will continue to work for those who have it downloaded, Adobe noted. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some users are recommending other animation programs to use instead, including <a href=\"https://moho.lostmarble.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Moho Animation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.toonboom.com/products/harmony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Toon Boom Harmony.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Adobe for comment.

Scott said what makes their accelerator different is that it is specifically built “for student founders by student founders.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Student programs like this aren’t new. UC Berkeley offers a similar program called Free Ventures for students seeking pre-seed funding, and MIT has its own Sandbox Innovation Fund. Even Stanford has some accelerator programs, both run by or affiliated with the school, such as StartX, LaunchPad, and Cardinal Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Students have enjoyed how we’ve brought together so many others from different American colleges,” Nafi said of his program, comparing it to Stanford’s Treehacks hackathon. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Breakthrough’s purpose is to fill in the funding and opportunity gap that exists in many of these ecosystems because students have historically lacked access to capital and the networks required to launch their entrepreneurial pursuits,” Scott added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Breakthrough will have a hybrid model, with in-person meetups at local powerhouse VC firms, culminating in a Demo Day at Stanford. Those participating in the program get access to grant funding (up to $10,000), compute credits (through Microsoft and the Nvidia Inception program), legal support, mentorship, “along with the opportunity to receive a $50,000 follow-on investment at the conclusion of the program,” Nafi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve nailed the student-founder experience to a T,” Nafi said. “Hence why we offer the resources we do and have structured the program in this way. Students really feel like we get them, and that’s because we are students.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The duo hopes to deploy the fund over three years, aiming to incubate at least 100 companies. Overall, Nafi hopes this fund will help grow Breakthrough into “the hub for Gen Z entrepreneurship and thought leadership,” specifically given the anxiety many young people feel about their economic future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Applications for the latest cohort open today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We hope that by supporting young entrepreneurs, we’re able to uplift as many stories as possible to then inspire many more across the world to use the tools and knowledge around them to pursue entrepreneurship not only to change their communities, but also gain economic stability for themselves and their families,” Nafi said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to correct the name of one of the investment firms. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Together, we’re setting a new standard for AI innovation, helping businesses transform with confidence, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI declined to share information on the deal beyond the press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If this deal feels familiar, it should. Snowflake announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/anthropic-signs-200m-deal-to-bring-its-llms-to-snowflakes-customers/\">$200 million enterprise deal with AI research lab Anthropic</a> at the beginning of December. At the time, Ramaswamy was quoted making very similar comments about how the partnership with Anthropic would give its customers access to powerful AI models on top of their existing data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our partnership with OpenAI is a multi-year commercial commitment focused on reliability, performance, and real customer usage. At the same time, we remain intentionally model-agnostic. Enterprises need choice, and we do not believe in locking customers into a single provider,” Baris Gultekin, vice president of AI at Snowflake, told TechCrunch over email. “OpenAI is an important partner, and it is one of several frontier model providers available on Snowflake today, alongside Anthropic, Google, Meta, and others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snowflake isn’t the only enterprise signing sizable deals with multiple AI companies.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, workflow automation platform ServiceNow <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/servicenow-inks-another-ai-partnership-this-time-with-anthropic/\">announced multi-year deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic</a> for very similar reasons as Snowflake. ServiceNow president, COO, and CPO Amit Zavery told TechCrunch at the time that working with both AI labs was deliberate because they wanted to give their customers and employees the ability to choose which model they wanted based on the task at hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to pinpoint which AI companies are seeing the most enterprise adoption success thus far. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Menlo Ventures survey</a> from late 2025 shows its portfolio company Anthropic holds a commanding market lead; an <a href=\"https://a16z.com/leaders-gainers-and-unexpected-winners-in-the-enterprise-ai-arms-race/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Andreessen Horowitz report</a> from last week naturally found its portfolio company OpenAI is leading the pack.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These conflicting surveys make it difficult to accurately track enterprise AI usage trends. However, this latest string of deals does provide a short-term view of what enterprise AI adoption will look like. The upshot: Enterprises will continue to strike partnerships with multiple AI companies because each one offers large language models with varying strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprises are likely going to partner with multiple AI players because different AI companies and their large language models come with their own strengths and weaknesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprise AI could easily become a market that contains several winners with an overlapping customer base, similar to how many ride-hail users swap between Lyft and Uber based on what makes the most sense for that moment. Case in point: Employees of these enterprises already use their preferred model regardless of their company contracts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> Or maybe there will be a clear winner after all. But for now, it’s likely we are going to see enterprises ink deals with multiple players as they continue to hunt for where AI can deliver tangible value.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, Mozilla <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-controls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> that Firefox will soon let users block all current and future generative AI features. Users will also have the option to block certain AI features in Firefox, while keeping others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starting with Firefox 148, which is rolling out on February 24, users will find a new AI controls section within the desktop browser settings. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People who don’t want access to any AI features from Firefox can turn on the “Block AI enhancements” toggle. When this setting is turned on, they won’t see pop-ups or reminders to use existing or upcoming AI features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new AI controls will also let users manage AI features individually. These features include “Translations,” which allows you to browse the web in your preferred language, Alt text in PDFs, AI-enhanced tab grouping, link previews, and Firefox’s AI chatbot in the sidebar, which lets you use your chosen chatbot as you browse, including services like Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is changing the web, and people want very different things from it,” the company wrote in a blog post. “We’ve heard from many who want nothing to do with AI. We’ve also heard from others who want AI tools that are genuinely useful. Listening to our community, alongside our ongoing commitment to offer choice, led us to build AI controls.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement comes as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/mozillas-new-ceo-says-ai-is-coming-to-firefox-but-will-remain-a-choice/\">Mozilla appointed Anthony Enzor-DeMeo</a> as its CEO back in December. Enzor-DeMeo said at the time that Mozilla would be investing in AI and would add AI features to Firefox, but that the company would make these features optional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it,” he wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enzor-DeMeo’s comments come as Mozilla scrambles to adapt in a rapidly changing browser market. Although browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome dominated the browser space for more than a decade, they are facing renewed competition from companies such as Perplexity, Arc, OpenAI, and Opera.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Mozilla plans to invest in new AI features, it’s also focused on transparency. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/27/mozilla-building-an-ai-rebel-alliance-to-take-on-openai-anthropic-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC reported</a> last week that Mozilla President Mark Surman said he’s building “a rebel alliance of sorts” made up of tech startups, developers, and public-interest technologists committed to making AI more trustworthy and to checking the power of players like OpenAI and Anthropic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mozilla will deploy around $1.4 billion worth of reserves to support tech businesses and nonprofits, including its own, CNBC reports. The company is pursuing investments that promote AI transparency and push back against companies growing at historic speeds with limited oversight. <br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This initiative could deliver significant cost savings for customers and may increase Grubhub’s appeal in a fiercely competitive market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Super Bowl advertisement stars actor George Clooney at an extravagant dinner party. As the host dramatically asks, “Who will eat the fees?” Clooney responds, “Grubhub will eat the fees.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyvGh2-Gsdg?si=7VG2PpbF_ErYbURE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Grubhub says this is a permanent offering aimed at putting more money back in customers’ pockets amid challenging economic times. The company notes that delivery and service fees on orders over $50 usually average about $13 per transaction across food delivery apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Grubhub’s move to permanently eliminate fees on all orders over $50 stands out as a unique offer in the food delivery space. Neither DoorDash nor Uber Eats offers a permanent waiver of delivery and service fees on large orders. Their promotions are typically limited-time offers or tied to paid subscription services (such as DashPass or Uber One), which often apply only to select restaurants or are subject to other restrictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, this new offering comes as Grubhub faces challenges in user growth and trails behind its competitors.

But as developers experiment with new interfaces and form factors for human-AI collaboration, it’s become hard for even the most advanced AI labs to keep up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The current trend is for agentic software development — systems where AI agents can work independently on coding tasks — epitomized by the Claude Code and Cowork apps. In the meantime, OpenAI has been gradually building out its Codex tool, which launched as <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/codex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a command line tool</a> last April and <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded to a web interface</a> one month later.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now OpenAI is taking a major step toward catching up. On Monday, the company launched a new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">macOS app</a> for Codex, integrating many of the agentic practices that have become popular in the past year. The new app is designed to work with multiple agents in parallel, integrating <a href=\"https://agentskills.io/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">agent skills</a> and other state-of-the-art workflows. The launch also comes less than two months after <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2-codex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the launch of GPT-5.2-Codex</a>, OpenAI’s most powerful coding model, which the company hopes will be enough to tempt over Claude Code users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you really want to do sophisticated work on something complex, 5.2 is the strongest model by far,” CEO Sam Altman told reporters on a press call. “However, it’s been harder to use, so taking that level of model capability and putting it in a more flexible interface, we think is going to matter quite a bit.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Altman’s confidence in GPT-5.2 is understandable, coding benchmarks tell a more complicated story. GPT-5.2 does hold <a href=\"https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the top spot on TerminalBench</a> (a test measuring how well AI handles command-line programming tasks), at least as of press time. But agents from Gemini 3 and Claude Opus have logged roughly equivalent scores — lower, but within the margin of error of the benchmark. Results from <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SWE-bench</a>, another coding benchmark that tests AI’s ability to fix real-world software bugs, are similar, showing no clear advantage for GPT-5.2. However, agentic use cases have been difficult to benchmark effectively, and state-of-the-art models can vary significantly in user experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Codex app also comes with a range of new features that OpenAI says will help it achieve parity or, in some cases, outpace the various Claude apps. The Codex app will allow for automations that can be set to run in the background on an automatic schedule, with results placed in a queue to be reviewed when the user returns. Users can also select different personalities for the agent — from pragmatic to empathetic — depending on their working style.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But for the company, the biggest selling point is the sheer speed of development that’s made possible by AI. “You can use this from a clean sheet of paper, brand new, to make a really quite sophisticated piece of software in a few hours,” Altman said. “As fast as I can type in new ideas, that is the limit of what can get built.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Ho said this “would explain the highly selective targeting” seen during the campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rapid7, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">investigated the incident</a>, attributed the hacking to Lotus Blossom, a long-running espionage group known to work for China, and said the hacks targeted government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notepad++ is one of the longest-running open source projects, spanning more than two decades, and it counts at least tens of millions of downloads to date, including by employees at organizations around the world.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who <a href=\"https://doublepulsar.com/small-numbers-of-notepad-users-reporting-security-woes-371d7a3fd2d9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first discovered the cyberattack and wrote up his findings</a> in December, the hackers compromised a small number of organizations “with interests in East Asia” after someone unwittingly used a tainted version of the popular software. Beaumont said that the hackers were able to gain “hands-on” access to the computers of victims who were running hijacked versions of Notepad++. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ho said that the “exact technical mechanism” of how the hackers broke into his servers remains under investigation, but provided some details as to how the attack went down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the blog, Ho said that Notepad++’s website was hosted on a shared hosting server. The attackers “specifically targeted” Notepad++’s web domain with the goal of exploiting a bug in the software to redirect some users to a malicious server run by the hackers. This allowed the hackers to deliver malicious updates to certain users who had requested a software update, until the <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/v889-released/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bug was fixed in November</a> and the hackers’ access was terminated in early December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented,” wrote Ho. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an email, Ho told TechCrunch that his hosting provider confirmed his shared server was compromised but that the provider did not say how the hackers initially broke in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ho apologized for the incident, and urged users to download the <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.9.1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most recent version</a> of his software, which contains a fix for the bug.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cyberattack targeting Notepad++ users is somewhat reminiscent of the 2019-2020 cyberattack affecting customers of SolarWinds, a software company that makes IT and network management tools for large Fortune 500 organizations, including government departments. Russian government spies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/\">hacked into the company’s servers</a> and secretly planted a backdoor in its software, allowing the Russian spies to access data on those customers’ networks once the update had rolled out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The SolarWinds breach affected several government agencies, including Homeland Security and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice, and State.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated with a response from Ho and with additional details from Rapid7.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This model recognizes plant species instantly and allows farmers to target new weeds without needing to retrain the robots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The LPM is trained on more than 150 million photos and data points collected by the company’s machines across the more than 100 farms in 15 countries where the robots currently operate. The model now powers Carbon AI, the AI system that serves as the brains inside the company’s autonomous weed-killing robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paul Mikesell, the founder and CEO of Carbon Robotics, told TechCrunch that prior to LPM, every time a new type of weed would show up on a farm — or even the same type of weed in different soil or with a slightly different appearance — the company would have to create new data labels to retrain its machines to recognize the plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This process took about 24 hours each time, Mikesell said. Now, LPM can learn a new weed instantly, even if it’s never seen it before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The farmer can live in real time and say, ‘Hey, this is a new weed. I want you to kill this,’ and that was something that had never been done before,” Mikesell said. “There’s no new labeling or retraining because the Large Plant Model understands, at a much deeper level, what it’s looking at and the type of plant.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mikesell said that the company, which was founded in 2018, started developing this model shortly after it began shipping its first machines in 2022. Mikesell has years of experience building these types of neural networks from previous roles at Uber and working on Meta’s Oculus virtual reality headsets.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new model will reach the company’s existing systems through a software update. From there, farmers can tell the machine what to kill and what to protect by selecting photos that the machine has collected in the robot’s user interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Carbon Robotics has raised more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/11/carbons-laser-weeding-robots-score-another-30-million/\">$185 million in venture capital</a> from backers including Nvidia NVentures, Bond, and Anthos Capital, among others. Now, the company will look to continue to fine-tune the model as the machines continue to feed the LPM new data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have over 150 million labeled plants now in our training set,” Mikesell said. “We have enough data now that we should be able to look at any picture and decide what kind of plant that is, what species it is, what it’s related to, what its structure is like, without having ever even seen that particular plant before, because we have so much data going into the neural net.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to some reports, Grok generated <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">thousands</a> of nonconsensual explicit images every hour, which were then disseminated at scale on X, Musk’s social media platform that’s owned by xAI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is deeply concerning that the federal government would continue to deploy an AI product with system-level failures resulting in generation of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material,” the letter, signed by advocacy groups like Public Citizen, Center for AI and Digital Policy, and Consumer Federation of America, reads. “Given the administration’s executive orders, guidance, and the recently passed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/trump-signs-bill-criminalizing-revenge-porn-and-explicit-deepfakes/\">Take It Down Act</a> supported by the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/icymi-president-trump-signs-take-it-down-act-into-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">White House</a>, it is alarming that [Office of Management and Budget] has not yet directed federal agencies to decommission Grok.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI reached an agreement last September with the General Services Administration (GSA), the government’s purchasing arm, to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/elon-musks-xai-offers-grok-to-federal-government-for-42-cents/\">sell Grok to federal agencies</a> under the executive branch. Two months before, xAI — alongside Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI — secured a contract worth up to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/14/xai-pentagon-grok-contract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$200 million</a> with the Department of Defense. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid the scandals on X in mid-January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Grok will join Google’s Gemini in <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pentagon-embraces-musks-grok-ai-chatbot-as-it-draws-global-outcry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">operating inside the Pentagon network</a>, handling both classified and unclassified documents, which experts say is a national security risk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter’s authors argue that Grok has proven itself incompatible with the administration’s requirements for AI systems. According to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-22-Driving-Efficient-Acquisition-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Government.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OMB’s guidance</a>, systems that present severe and foreseeable risks that cannot be adequately mitigated must be discontinued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our primary concern is that Grok has pretty consistently shown to be an unsafe large language model,” JB Branch, a Public Citizen Big Tech accountability advocate and one of the letter’s authors, told TechCrunch. “But there’s also a deep history of Grok having a variety of meltdowns, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/18/grok-says-its-skeptical-about-holocaust-death-toll-then-blames-programming-error/\">antisemitic</a> rants, sexist rants, sexualized images of women and children.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several governments have demonstrated an unwillingness to engage with Grok following its behavior in January, which builds on a series of incidents including the generation of antisemitic posts on X and calling itself “MechaHitler.” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/\">Indonesia, Malaysia</a>, and the Philippines all blocked access to Grok (they’ve <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/indonesia-conditionally-lifts-ban-on-grok/\">subsequently lifted those bans</a>), and the European Union, the U.K., South Korea, and India are actively investigating xAI and X regarding data privacy and the distribution of illegal content. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter also comes a week after Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews media and tech for families, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/among-the-worst-weve-seen-report-slams-xais-grok-over-child-safety-failures/\">published a damning risk assessment</a> that found Grok is among the most unsafe for kids and teens. One could argue that, based on the findings of the report — including Grok’s propensity to offer unsafe advice, share information about drugs, generate violent and sexual imagery, spew conspiracy theories, and generate biased outputs — Grok isn’t all that safe for adults either.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you know that a large language model is or has been declared unsafe by AI safety experts, why in the world would you want that handling the most sensitive data we have?” Branch said. “From a national security standpoint, that just makes absolutely no sense.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Christianson, a former National Security Agency contractor and current founder of <a href=\"https://gobii.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gobii AI</a>, a no-code AI agent platform for classified environments, says that using closed-source LLMs in general is a problem, particularly for the Pentagon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Closed weights means you can’t see inside the model, you can’t audit how it makes decisions,” he said. “Closed code means you can’t inspect the software or control where it runs. The Pentagon is going closed on both, which is the worst possible combination for national security.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These AI agents aren’t just chatbots,” Christianson added. “They can take actions, access systems, move information around. You need to be able to see exactly what they’re doing and how they’re making decisions. Open source gives you that. Proprietary cloud AI doesn’t.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The risks of using corrupted or unsafe AI systems spill out beyond national security use cases. Branch pointed out that an LLM that’s been shown to have biased and discriminatory outputs could produce disproportionate negative outcomes for people as well, especially if used in departments involving housing, labor, or justice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the OMB has yet to publish its consolidated 2025 federal AI use case inventory, TechCrunch has reviewed the use cases of several agencies — most of which are either not using Grok or are not disclosing their use of Grok. Aside from the DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services also appears to be actively using Grok, mainly for scheduling and managing social media posts and generating first drafts of documents, briefings, or other communication materials. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Branch pointed to what he sees as a philosophical alignment between Grok and the administration as a reason for overlooking the chatbot’s shortcomings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Grok’s brand is being the ‘anti-woke large language model,’ and that ascribes to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-anti-woke-ai-order-could-reshape-how-us-tech-companies-train-their-models/\">this administration’s philosophy,</a>” Branch said. “If you have an administration that has had multiple <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/stephen-miller-trump-white-house/685516/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">issues with folks</a> who’ve been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/17/thousands-protest-elon-musks-doge-in-nyc-on-presidents-day/\">accused of being Neo Nazis</a> or <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/dhs-white-nationalist-anti-immigrant-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">white supremacists</a>, and then they’re using a large language model that has been tied to that type of behavior, I would imagine they might have a propensity to use it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the coalition’s third letter after writing with similar concerns in <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/news/new-letter-calls-on-omb-to-block-grok-implementation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">August</a> and <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/article/omb-urged-again-to-suspend-federal-use-of-grok-ai-over-accuracy-and-bias-violations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">October</a> last year. In August, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/grok-imagine-xais-new-ai-image-and-video-generator-lets-you-make-nsfw-content/\">xAI launched “spicy mode” </a>in Grok Imagine, triggering mass creation of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes. TechCrunch also reported in August that private Grok conversations had been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/20/thousands-of-grok-chats-are-now-searchable-on-google/\">indexed by Google Search</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to the October letter, Grok was accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/05/elon-musk-harris-grok-misinformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">providing election misinformation</a>, including false deadlines for ballot changes and political deepfakes. xAI also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/28/elon-musk-grokipedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched Grokipedia</a>, which researchers found to be legitimizing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/17/grokipedia-elon-musk-far-right-racist#:~:text='Policies%20preserving%20demographic%20uniformity',commitments%20to%20human%20genetic%20uniformity%E2%80%9D.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">scientific racism</a>, HIV/AIDS skepticism, and vaccine conspiracies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from immediately suspending the federal deployment of Grok, the letter demands that the OMB formally investigate Grok’s safety failures and whether the appropriate oversight processes were conducted for the chatbot. It also asks the agency to publicly clarify whether Grok has been evaluated to comply with President Trump’s executive order requiring LLMs to be truth-seeking and neutral and whether it met OMB’s risk mitigation standards.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The administration needs to take a pause and reassess whether or not Grok meets those thresholds,” Branch said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI and OMB for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>A previous version of this article misspelled Gobii.

The company says that it allows for all kinds of content and doesn’t shadowban or censor people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his speech, Hijazi called out big tech companies for being unethical and selling user data for profit, and accused social networks of suppressing pro-Palestinian content and choosing to censor users selectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They don’t care about selling your data to someone else if that means profit for them.

But users can always tell when they’re talking to a business — the texts are displayed in gray, and the branding is often obvious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq’s customers wanted to be able to send blue-bubble messages to their customers, not green or gray, to lend an air of authenticity to their communications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, founded by former Shipt executives <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/RzgMCxo0l0UPwl3oTWuAHyfj3i?domain=de7f9591.streaklinks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elliott Potter</a> (CEO), <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/HRluCyp4m4hAk1R5iPC7Hx3Kvf?domain=de7f9591.streaklinks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Patrick Sullivan</a> (CTO), and <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/9dBxCzq8n8HO91AoCMFpH9dR_D?domain=de7f9591.streaklinks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jared Mattsson</a> (president), heard that feedback and launched an API in February 2025 that lets companies message their customers natively within iMessage, leveraging all the capabilities Apple’s platform offers to iPhone users, like group chats, emojis, threaded replies, images, and voice notes. Within eight months, Linq had doubled its annual recurring revenue it had built over four years, Potter told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq was not content with its newfound product-market fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called <a href=\"https://poke.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Poke</a>, which can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don’t have a CRM, but we really want to use your API’,” Potter told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poke <a href=\"https://x.com/interaction/status/1965093198482866317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">went viral</a> at launch last September, which, Potter says, led to his team being inundated with requests for tapping their messaging API. All of a sudden, a slew of AI companies wanted to offer their chatbots and assistants directly through iMessage, RCS, and SMS.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq now had a decision to make: stick with its original, steady revenue stream from serving B2B clients, or pivot once again to leverage its tech stack and become an infrastructure layer for a new segment of the AI market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We still love our sales customers, and we love that use case, but our choices were, do we stay a spoke of this wheel, or do we build the hub? Do we focus on being the infrastructure layer for all these different applications of programmatic messaging?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Potter thinks that consumers are suffering from app fatigue; but with Linq’s technology, there’s no need to use another app to interact with AI assistants as they can all live within their messaging app. Also, developers won’t have to worry about building an app since they can just build for a messaging-native interface instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Poke.com, along with others, have proved that AI has gotten good enough,” Potter said. “You don’t need a traditional app anymore to do things. Really, you just need an interface that will let you talk to an intelligent enough AI, maybe connect it to some of your systems, and just tell it what to do, and give it feedback.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq ended up pivoting, and it says its customer base has expanded by 132% from the previous quarter, and on average its customer accounts have expanded by 34%. Its customers’ AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/dont-trust-averages-how-to-assess-and-strengthen-the-health-of-your-business/\">net revenue retention</a> of 295% with zero churn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rosy outlook aside, the reality is that Linq is still building on top of Apple’s platform — at least for now. There’s no telling if Apple will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/whatssapp-changes-its-terms-to-bar-general-purpose-chatbots-from-its-platform/\">pull a Meta</a> and bar third parties from offering AI chatbots on its platform. Besides, iMessage is popular in the U.S., but the rest of the world also uses other messaging services like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Potter, however, says Linq’s eventual goal lies beyond messaging. “Our vision for the platform is everything you need to build conversational tech, and that’s not limited to a few channels. Right now, we have programmatic voice, we have iMessage, RCS, SMS. That’s just the beginning. Our ambition is, wherever your customers are, you should be able to talk to them, be it Slack, be it email, be it Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, anywhere your customers are, and can converse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By making AI-to-human communication as frictionless as texting a friend, Linq is enabling an entirely new category of companies,” Andrew Marks, co-founding partner of TQ Ventures, said in a statement. “Linq’s founding team is extraordinary, and we have no doubt in their ability to execute on this massive opportunity.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
