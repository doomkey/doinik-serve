The app offers access to micro dramas, which are essentially bite-sized TV shows that can be watched in a series of one-minute episodes. Think TikTok, but every single video you come across is a short episode of a fictional story. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PineDrama is available on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pinedrama/id6754134922\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ttmd.video&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Android</a>. It’s free and currently ad-free, though that could change in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-launches-a-new-micro-drama-app-called-pinedrama-2026-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Business Insider</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can find content through the app’s “Discover” tab, where you can sort through “All” or “Trending dramas, or through endless vertical recommendations that are tailored to your taste. PineDrama features a variety of genres, including thriller, romance, family, and more. Examples of popular shows include “Love at First Bite” and “The Officer Fell For Me.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app features a “Watch history” section where you can jump back into the various series you’re watching. There’s also a “Favorites” section where you can save the dramas you like the most. You can also share thoughts with other viewers in the comment section, and enter a full-screen viewing experience that gets rid of the caption and sidebar. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?w=668\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083524\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png 1660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=147,150 147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=295,300 295w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=768,782 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=668,680 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=1179,1200 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=1257,1280 1257w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=422,430 422w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=707,720 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=884,900 884w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=786,800 786w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=1509,1536 1509w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=656,668 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=368,375 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=606,617 606w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=522,531 522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-3.59.54-PM.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TikTok</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as TikTok launched <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-jumps-into-micro-dramas-buzzy-bite-sized-soaps-2025-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a “TikTok Minis”</a> section in its app late last year, where users can watch micro dramas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the launch of PineDrama, TikTok is taking on popular micro drama platforms like ReelShort and DramaBox. While the micro drama industry wasn’t that popular until recent years, it’s racing toward $26 billion in annual revenue by 2030, as reported by <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/global-microdrama-boom-1236560947/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Variety</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Short-form storytelling hasn’t always found success, even with notable backing. In 2020, DreamWorks co-founder and former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg launched a short-form streaming platform called Quibi with $1.75 billion in funding. The platform offered episodes under 10 minutes featuring popular Hollywood actors, but failed to gain traction and was shut down six months later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ReelShort and DramaBox succeeded where Quibi failed because while Quibi tried to compress Hollywood TV into shorter episodes, ReelShort and DramaBox created low-budget stories that hook viewers within the first few seconds, followed by continuous cliffhangers, all featuring non-union talent. Additionally, they target fans of soapy romance and revenge thriller stories, while Quibi tried to target everyone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok is now looking to replicate this success with PineDrama. The company already dominates the short-form social media space and is now aiming to take on another media category.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Traditional techniques, like <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/an-overview-of-high-throughput-screening-71561\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">high-throughput screening</a>, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/openai-backed-biotech-firm-chai-discovery-raises-130m-series-b-at-1-3b-valuation/\">completed its Series B</a>, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260108131261/en/Chai-Discovery-Announces-Collaboration-with-Eli-Lilly-and-Company-to-Accelerate-Biologics-Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">deal</a> in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of “computer-aided design suite” for molecules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-eli-lilly-announce-1-billion-investment-in-ai-drug-discovery-lab-163446796.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">on a $1 billion partnership</a> to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry isn’t <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/20/schrodinger-ramy-farid-drug-discovery-ai-physics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">without its detractors</a>. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uQDgLakjns4?si=xcf5QX0phrLqu5uG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unlikely to have a major impact</a>. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of <a href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/stories/our-investment-in-chai-discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chai’s major backers</a> — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chai may have been founded less than two years ago, but the startup’s origins began around six years ago, amid conversations between its co-founders and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. One of those founders, Josh Meier, previously worked for OpenAI in 2018 on its research and engineering team. After he left the company, Altman messaged Meier’s old college friend, Jack Dent, to ask about a potential business opportunity. Meier and Dent had originally met in computer science classes at Harvard but, at the time, Dent was a Stripe engineer (another company Altman was an early backer of). Altman asked him if he thought Meier would be open to collaborating on a proteomics startup — that is, a company focused on the study of proteins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman “messaged me to say that everyone at OpenAI thought highly of him and asked if I thought he’d be open to working with them on a proteomics spinout,” Dent said. Dent told Altman “of course,” but there was just one hitch: Meier didn’t feel like the technology was quite “there” yet. The AI tech behind such firms — which leverage powerful algorithms — was still a growing field and far from where it needed to be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meier was also pretty dead set on joining Facebook’s research and engineering team, which is what he would go on to do. At Facebook, Meier helped to develop <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/622803v4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ESM1</a>, the first transformer protein-language model — an important precursor to the work Chai is currently doing. After Meier’s time at Facebook, he would spend three years at Absci, another AI biotech firm based around drug creation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2024, Meier and Dent finally felt prepared to tackle the proteomics company they had originally discussed with Altman. “Josh and I reached back out to Sam and told him we should pick up that conversation where we left off — and that we were starting Chai together,” Dent said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI ended up becoming one of Chai’s first seed investors. Meier and Dent actually founded Chai — along with their co-founders, Matthew McPartlon and Jacques Boitreaud — while working out of the AI giant’s offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. “They were kind enough to give us some office space,” Dent revealed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, a little over a year later, as Chai basks in the glow of its newfound partnership with Eli Lilly, Dent says that the key to the company’s fast growth has been assembling a team of hugely talented people. “We really just put our heads down and pushed the frontier of what these models are capable of,” said Dent. “Every line of code in our codebase is homegrown. We’re not taking LLMs off the shelf that are in the open source [ecosystem] and fine-tuning them. These are highly custom architectures.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Catalyst’s Viboch told TechCrunch that she felt Chai was ready to hit the ground running. “There are no fundamental barriers to deployment of these models in drug discovery,” she said. “Companies will still need to take drug candidates through testing and clinical trials, but we believe there’ll be significant advantages to those who adopt these technologies — not just in compressing discovery timelines, but also in unlocking classes of medicines that have historically been difficult to develop.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Well, there’s one surefire way to do that, and that is through advertising. In the near term, that seems to be the AI giant’s plan, as it announced this week that limited ads are headed to certain ChatGPT users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a> published Friday, OpenAI said that it will begin testing ads in the U.S. for both its free and Go tiers. (Go accounts, which cost $8 a month, were <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced globally</a> on Friday.) The company frames this as a way to sustain free access while generating revenue from people who aren’t ready to commit to a paid subscription. For the time being, the company’s more expensive paid tiers — Pro, Plus, Business, and Enterprise — will not be getting any ads.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ads will appear at the bottom of a user’s conversation and will be targeted to the topic of discussion. Users will have some control over this situation, as they’ll be able to dismiss ads, see explanations for why they’re being shown particular ones, and also turn off personalization, which should defeat the ads’ targeted nature. The company has also made a commitment not to serve ads to users it believes are under the age of 18.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083447\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png 2070w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=2048,1154 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=1095,617 1095w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch (Screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says that ChatGPT will maintain “answer independence,” meaning that, despite the incorporation of advertising, those ads will not influence the answers that the chatbot serves to users.

For users of the free and Go tiers, the company obviously stands to make a significant amount of ad revenue.

The administration said it wants tech companies to bid on the contracts even if they don’t ultimately need the power for their data centers. Demand from data centers is expected to increase <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\">nearly threefold over the next decade</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PJM <a href=\"https://x.com/pjminterconnect/status/2012221538842329178?s=46&amp;t=b2YonHu0g__-GD-7lQoLAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> it was reviewing the “statement of principles” and that it would soon release the results of a months-long planning process that is looking to add new capacity to the grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The statement is nonbonding, though, and behind the scenes, PJM doesn’t appear to be jazzed about the administration attempting to force its hand. “We don’t have a lot to say on this,” PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/trump-to-direct-key-us-grid-operator-to-hold-emergency-auction?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told</a> Bloomberg yesterday. “We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, serves more than 65 million people and includes the data center hotspot of northern Virginia. Electricity rates in 2025 were up about 10% to 15% in the region compared with the year before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the last decade, PJM’s peak load has <a href=\"https://www.monitoringanalytics.com/reports/presentations/2026/IMM_MC_Market_Monitor_Report_20260122.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">increased 10%</a>, according to Monitoring Analytics, and it’s expected to increase another 6.5% in 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the blame has been laid at the feet of tech companies and data center operators, which have been using increasing amounts of power for AI.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The price of natural gas is also to blame. PJM is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel, and the price has soared recently. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent monitor, says that about 60% of 2025’s price increases are the result of high prices for fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grid operators have been put in a bind as data centers have ramped up demand for electricity after more than a decade of zero growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building new fossil fuel power plants is a years-long proposition costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Many utilities and power providers are hesitant to commit to those timelines and outlays. If the AI boom fizzles, they could be left with unprofitable power plants that are built to operate for decades. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech companies, which haven’t traditionally been in the power business, have instead been turning to renewables, which are cheaper, more modular, and faster to deploy. Solar and batteries have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/30/data-centers-love-solar-heres-a-comprehensive-guide-to-deals-over-100-megawatts/\">an early winner</a>. A typical solar farm can be built in about 18 months, and because it can be built in phases, can start delivering power before it’s complete. That aligns more closely with data center construction, allowing companies to manage risk on similar timelines.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The activist, who is following the digital side of the Iranian protests from afar, said the campaign targeted people involved in Iran-related activities, such as himself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This hacking campaign comes as Iran grapples with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/irans-internet-shutdown-is-now-one-of-its-longest-ever-as-protests-continue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the longest nationwide internet shutdown in its history</a>, as anti-government protests — and violent crackdowns — rage across the country. Given that Iran and its closest adversaries are highly active in the offensive cyberspace (read: hacking people), we wanted to learn more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gharib shared the full phishing link with TechCrunch soon after his post, allowing us to capture a copy of the source code of the phishing web page used in the attack. He also <a href=\"https://github.com/narimangharib/irgc-whatsapp-phishkit/blob/main/threat-report.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared a write-up of his findings</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch analyzed the source code of the phishing page, and with added input from security researchers, we believe the campaign aimed to steal Gmail and other online credentials, compromise WhatsApp accounts, and conduct surveillance by stealing location data, photos, and audio recordings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is unclear, however, if the hackers were government-linked agents, spies, or cybercriminals — or all three. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch also identified a way to view a real-time copy of all the victims’ responses saved on the attacker’s server, which was left exposed and accessible without a password. This data revealed dozens of victims who had unwittingly entered their credentials into the phishing site and were subsequently likely hacked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The list includes a Middle Eastern academic working in national security studies; the boss of an Israeli drone maker; a senior Lebanese cabinet minister; at least one journalist; and people in the United States or with U.S. phone numbers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch is publishing our findings after validating much of Gharib’s report. The phishing site is now down.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-inside-the-attack-chain\">Inside the attack chain</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Gharib, the WhatsApp message he received contained a suspicious link, which loaded a phishing site in the victim’s browser.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg\" alt=\"two screenshots side by side of a WhatsApp message, showing a malicious link to whatsapp-meeting.duckdns.org.\" class=\"wp-image-3083386\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=430,237 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=720,397 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=900,496 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=800,441 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=668,368 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=708,390 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Nariman Gharib</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The link shows that the attackers relied on a dynamic DNS provider called DuckDNS for their phishing campaign. Dynamic DNS providers allow people to connect easy-to-remember web addresses — in this case, a <code>duckdns.org</code> subdomain — to a server where its IP address might frequently change. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear whether the attackers shut down the phishing site of their own accord or were caught and cut off by DuckDNS. We reached out to DuckDNS with inquiries, but its owner Richard Harper requested that we send an abuse report instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From what we understand, the attackers used DuckDNS to mask the real location of the phishing page, presumably to make it look like a genuine WhatsApp link. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phishing page was actually hosted at <code>alex-fabow.online</code>, a domain that was first registered in early November 2025. This domain has several other, related domains hosted on the same dedicated server, and these domain names follow a pattern that suggests the campaign also targeted other providers of virtual meeting rooms, like <code>meet-safe.online</code> and <code>whats-login.online</code>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re not sure what happens while the DuckDNS link loads in the victim’s browser, or how the link determines which specific phishing page to load. It may be that the DuckDNS link redirects the target to a specific phishing page based on information it gleans from the user’s device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phishing page would not load in our web browser, preventing us from directly interacting with it. Reading the source code of the page, however, allowed us to better understand how the attack worked.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gmail credential and phone number phishing</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Depending on the target, tapping on a phishing link would open a fake Gmail login page, or ask for their phone number, and begin an attack flow aimed at stealing their password and two-factor authentication code. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the source code of the phishing page code had at least one flaw: TechCrunch found that by modifying the phishing page’s URL in our web browser, we could view a file on the attacker’s servers that was storing records of every victim who had entered their credentials. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The file contained over 850 records of information submitted by victims during the attack flow. These records detailed each part of the phishing flow that the victim was in. This included copies of the usernames and passwords that victims had entered on the phishing page, as well as incorrect entries and their two-factor codes, effectively serving as a keylogger. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The records also contained each victim’s user agent, a string of text that identifies the operating system and browser versions used to view websites. This data shows that the campaign was designed to target Windows, macOS, iPhone, and Android users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposed file allowed us to follow the attack flow step-by-step for each victim. In one case, the exposed file shows a victim clicking on a malicious link, which opened a page that looked like a Gmail sign-in window. The log shows the victim entering their email credentials several times until they enter the correct password. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The records show the same victim entering their two-factor authentication code sent to them by text message.

This is a long-known attack technique that abuses the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/11/24/spyware-allows-cyber-threat-actors-target-users-messaging-applications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WhatsApp device linking feature</a> and has been similarly abused to <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">target users of messaging app Signal</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We asked <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/granitt-journalist-security/\">Granitt founder Runa Sandvik</a>, a security researcher who works to help secure at-risk individuals, to examine a copy of the phishing page code and see how it functions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sandvik found that when the page loaded, the code would trigger a browser notification asking the user for permission to access their location (via <code>navigator.geolocation</code>), as well as photos and audio (<code>navigator.getUserMedia</code>). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If accepted, the browser would immediately send the person’s coordinates to the attacker, capable of identifying the location of the victim. The page would then continue to share the victim’s location data every few seconds, for as long as the page remained open. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The code also allowed the attackers to record bursts of audio and snap photos every three to five seconds using the device camera. However, we did not see any location data, audio, or images that had been collected on the server.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thoughts on victims, timing, and attribution</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We do not know who is behind this campaign. What is clear is that the campaign was successful in stealing credentials from victims, and it is possible that the phishing campaign could resurface. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite knowing the identities of some of the people in this cluster of victims who were targeted, we don’t have enough information to understand the nature of the campaign. The number of victims hacked by this campaign (that we know of) is fairly low — fewer than 50 individuals — and affects seemingly ordinary people across the Kurdish community, as well as academics, government officials, business leaders, and other senior figures across the broader Iranian diaspora and Middle East.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It may be that there are far more victims than we are aware of, which could help us understand who was targeted and potentially why.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-case-that-this-could-be-a-government-backed-actor\">The case that this could be a government-backed actor</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is unclear what motivated the hackers to steal people’s credentials and hijack their WhatsApp accounts, which could also help identify who is behind this hacking campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A government-backed group, for example, might want to steal the email password and two-factor codes of a high-value target, like a politician or journalist, so they can download private and confidential information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That could make sense since Iran is currently almost entirely cut off from the outside world, and getting information in or out of the country presents a challenge. Both the Iranian government, or a foreign government with interests in Iran’s affairs, could plausibly want to know who influential Iranian-linked individuals are communicating with, and what about.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As such, the timing of this phishing campaign and who it appears to be targeting could point to an espionage campaign aimed at trying to collect information about a narrow list of people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We asked Gary Miller, a security researcher at Citizen Lab and mobile espionage expert, to also review the phishing code and some of the exposed data from the attacker’s server. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Miller said the attack “certainly [had] the hallmarks of an IRGC-linked spearphishing campaign,” referring to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#phishing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">highly targeted email hacks</a> carried out by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a faction of Iran’s military known for carrying out cyberattacks. Miller pointed to a mix of indications, including the international scope of victim targeting, credential theft, the abuse of popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#social-engineering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">social engineering techniques</a> used in the phishing link.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-case-that-this-might-be-a-financially-motivated-actor\">The case that this might be a financially motivated actor</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the other hand, a financially motivated hacker could use the same stolen Gmail password and two-factor code of another high-value target, such as a company executive, to steal proprietary and sensitive business information from their inbox. The hacker could also forcibly reset passwords of their victim’s cryptocurrency and bank accounts to empty their wallets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The campaign’s focus on accessing a victim’s location and device media, however, is unusual for a financially motivated actor, who might have little use for pictures and audio recordings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We asked Ian Campbell, a threat researcher at DomainTools, which helps analyze public internet records, to look at the domain names used in the campaign to help understand when they were first set up, and if these domains were connected to any other previously known or identified infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Campbell found that while the campaign targeted victims in the midst of Iran’s ongoing nationwide protests, its infrastructure had been set up weeks ago. He added that most of the domains connected to this campaign were registered in early November 2025, and one related domain was created months back in August 2025. Campbell described the domains as medium to high risk and said they appear to be linked to a cybercrime operation driven by financial motivations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An additional wrinkle is that Iran’s government has been known to outsource cyberattacks to criminal hacking groups, presumably to shield its involvement in hacking operations against its citizens. The U.S. Treasury has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2292\">sanctioned Iranian companies in the past</a> for acting as fronts for Iran’s IRGC and conducting cyberattacks, such as launching targeted phishing and social engineering attacks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Miller notes, “This drives home the point that clicking on unsolicited WhatsApp links, no matter how convincing, is a high-risk, unsafe practice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>To securely contact this reporter, you can reach out using Signal via the username: zackwhittaker.1337</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai contributed reporting.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The country will initially cap annual imports at 49,000 vehicles. That cap will slowly increase to about 70,000 in around five years, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-canada-carney-xi-beijing-b71c1b67d3489a8b4058c650152b0cb9#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the Associated Press</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a major shift that comes at a time when China is looking to boost EV exports, especially as the European Union weighs <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-weighs-minimum-price-plan-175557306.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lowering its own tariffs on the vehicles</a>. The U.S. remains a holdout on that front, though this week President Trump said he’d be <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/784461/let-china-come-in-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open to Chinese automakers</a> building factories in the U.S. that produce EVs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">China has already been exporting gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles to Mexico, with the latter <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/783051/chinese-ev-export-numbers-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">especially booming in 2025</a>. Many of the leading EV-makers in China have been agitating to enter the U.S. market, including Geely, which held a drive event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. While the company was showcasing a number of models ostensibly meant for the Mexican market, one of its communications executives implied the conglomerate <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/783515/geely-lynk-zeekr-coming-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is aiming to announce an entry</a> into the U.S. in the next two-to-three years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Automotive journalists, influencers, and even some executives — most notably Ford CEO Jim Farley — have praised the quality of Chinese EVs over the last few years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the 100% tariff on Chinese cars has so far made the idea of exporting them to the U.S. a non-starter. That’s despite the fact that Chinese EVs are sold at far lower prices than the average car in the U.S. — a feat typically achieved through a combination of extremely low cost of capital, labor, and a willingness to burn money to gain market share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">China’s ability to undercut other automakers on price is just one concern. The U.S. has spent the last few years trying to separate itself from China’s EV supply chain for national security reasons, under both Presidents Biden and Trump. There are other legal hurdles too. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule restricting the import and sale of <a href=\"https://www.bis.gov/connected-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">certain connected vehicles</a> and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Avery Ash, the CEO of nonprofit Securing America’s Future Energy, cautioned against Trump’s idea of allowing Chinese automakers to build cars in the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere—it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure,” he said in a statement. “We urge the President to stay tough against China and protect American auto manufacturers and workers.” <br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These controversial topics include self-harm, abortion, suicide, and domestic and sexual abuse. YouTube notes that content on child abuse or eating disorders will remain ineligible for full monetization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjX4RqqyCx4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the change this week in a video on its Creator Insider channel.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the past, the degree of graphic or descriptive detail was not considered a significant factor in determining advertiser friendliness, even for some dramatized material,” YouTube explained. “Consequently, such uploads typically received a yellow dollar icon, which restricted their ability to be fully monetized. With this week’s update, our guidelines are becoming more permissive, and creators will be able to earn more ad revenue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Google-owned company says it’s making the change in response to creator feedback that YouTube’s guidelines were leading to limited ad revenue on dramatized and topical content. YouTube notes that it wants to ensure that creators who are telling sensitive stories or producing dramatized content have the opportunity to earn ad revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We took a closer look and found our guidelines in this area had become too restrictive and ended up demonetizing uploads like dramatized content,” YouTube said. “This content might reference topics that advertisers find controversial, but are ultimately comfortable running their ads against. For example, content may be in a fictional context or voiced from personal experiences in passing or in a non-graphic manner. So, as long as the content steers clear of very descriptive or graphic scenes or segments, creators can now earn more ad revenue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as YouTube has been easing up on how it polices content on its platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company told moderators last year to leave up videos that may violate platform rules if they are considered to be in the public interest. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/technology/youtube-videos-content-moderation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The New York Times</a> reported at the time that these videos included discussions of political, social, and cultural issues. The policy shift came at a time when social media platforms were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/meta-officially-says-goodbye-to-its-us-fact-checkers-on-monday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rolling back online speech moderation</a> after President Donald Trump returned to office. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube notes that there are still some areas where ads will remain restricted, as topics like child abuse, including child sex trafficking and eating disorders, are not included in this update. Descriptive segments of those topics or dramatized content around them remain ineligible for ad revenue.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This week, California’s attorney general <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">opened an investigation</a> into xAI’s chatbot over the proliferation of the “nonconsensual sexually explicit material.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the wake of the controversy, Bluesky saw its downloads surge in the U.S. According to new data from market intelligence provider <a href=\"http://appfigures.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Appfigures</a>, daily downloads of Bluesky’s iOS app have jumped nearly 50% from the period before news of the deepfakes reached critical mass.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083344\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bluesky-downloads-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Appfigures</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm says Bluesky typically sees around 4,000 installs in the U.S. per day, but from December 30, 2025, through January 6, 2026, Bluesky’s iOS downloads in the U.S. totaled around 19,500. From January 7, 2026, through January 14, downloads grew to 29,000 — a 49% increase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, cashtags will allow the app to catch up to one of X’s more popular use cases: discussing stocks. To create a cashtag, you place a dollar symbol before the stock ticker symbol (e.g., $AAPL for Apple).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea for cashtags was first introduced by stocks-focused social network Stocktwits, which now has over 10 million users, before the tags were later adopted by Twitter in 2012.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Bluesky says it’s expanding access to the “Live Now” experimental feature that lets users add a temporary “LIVE” badge to their avatar to indicate when they’re streaming online. Currently, this feature only supports Twitch and doesn’t allow anyone to go live directly on Bluesky itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The boost in activity on Bluesky comes after the network saw declines in downloads and usage last year. In April 2025, Appfigures noted that the social networking startup’s downloads <a href=\"https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/20250418?f=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped </a>to new lows, and daily average users on mobile devices had <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/11/07/bluesky-and-x-users-plummet-year-after-trumps-election-win-truth-social-makes-small-gains/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declined nearly 40%</a> by the end of October, per Similarweb data. <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/05/29/bluesky-has-caught-on-with-many-news-influencers-but-x-remains-popular/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pew Research reported last year</a> that a number of influencers now have Bluesky accounts, but they still tend to post more regularly on X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This suggests that the switching costs are higher than some would expect when it comes to swapping out one real-time social network for another. Adding new features will only be part of the battle for Bluesky; it will also have to find a way to get users to change years of ingrained behavior.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Italy has launched two investigations into Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard, alleging the company has engaged in “misleading and aggressive” sales practices for its popular smartphone games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The country’s competition regulator, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza E Del Mercato (AGCM), said the investigations focus on the use of design elements to induce users, particularly children, into playing for long periods, and make in-game purchases by urging them to not miss out on rewards.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers — including minors — leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved,” the AGCM <a href=\"https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2026/1/PS13020-PS13039\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AGCM said the games are advertised as free-to-play but offer in-game purchases. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That isn’t particularly surprising, however, as, unlike full-priced games, free-to-play games have long relied on loot boxes and sales of in-game cosmetics for monetization. Diablo Immortal, for example, offers in-game cosmetics, as well as currency that allows players to accelerate their progression and gain items for crafting, for as much as $200. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the nature of the game, it’s not unusual for many users to repeatedly spend on such items in the course of play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile have player bases in the hundreds of thousands. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The authority is also looking into the games’ parental control features, as the default settings lets minors make in-game purchases, play for long periods without restraints, and allow them to chat with others in-game. The AGCM also highlighted privacy concerns, as the games appear to lead users to select all consent options when signing up, and said it would look into the company’s consent process for harvesting and using personal data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the Authority’s view, the company may be acting in breach of consumer protection rules and, in particular, the duty of professional diligence required in a sector that is particularly sensitive to the risks of gaming-related addiction,” the regulator said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Most are coding web applications, though they are also increasingly vibe coding mobile apps intended to run only on their own personal phones and devices. Some who are already registered as Apple developers are leaving their personal apps in beta on TestFlight.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is a new era of app creation that is sometimes called micro apps, personal apps, or fleeting apps because they are intended to be used only by the creator (or the creator plus a select few other people) and only for as long as the creator wants to keep the app. They are not intended for wide distribution or sale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, founder Jordi Amat told TechCrunch that he built a fleeting web gaming app for his family to play over the holidays and simply shut it down once the vacation was over.   </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s Shamillah Bankiya, a partner at Dawn Capital, who is building a podcast translation web app for personal use. Interestingly enough, Darrell Etherington, a former TechCrunch writer, now a vice president at SBS Comms, is also building his own personal podcast translation app. “A lot of people I know are using Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable to build apps for specific use cases,” he said.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One artist told TechCrunch that he built a “vice tracker” for himself to see how many hookahs and drinks he was consuming each weekend. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even professional developers are vibe coding personal apps. Software engineer James Waugh told TechCrunch he built a web app planning tool to help with his cooking hobby. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-web-apps-and-mobile\">Web apps and mobile</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because tools ranging from Claude Code to Lovable typically don’t require robust coding knowledge just to get to a functional app, we are witnessing the early rise of micro apps. These are apps that are extremely context-specific, address niche needs, and then “disappear when the need is no longer present,” Legand L. Burge III, a professor of computer science at Howard University, said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s similar to how trends on social media appear and then fade away,” Burge III continued. “But now, [it’s] software itself.”   </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yu said she now has six more ideas she wants to code. “It’s really exciting to be alive right now,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some ways, it was always easy for someone without much coding experience to create web apps via no-code platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/no-code-bubble-series-a/\">Bubble</a> and Adalo, which launched before LLMs became popular. What’s new is the rising ability to create personal, temporary apps for mobile devices, too. Also new: the growing realization that anyone can code just by describing, in regular language, the app they want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mobile micro apps still aren’t as easy as their web counterparts. This is because the standard way to load an app on an iPhone is to download it from the App Store, which requires a paid Apple Developer account. But increasingly mobile vibe-coding startups like <a href=\"https://www.create.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anything</a> (which <a href=\"https://www.create.xyz/blog/anything-series-a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised</a> $11 million, led by Footwork) and <a href=\"https://www.vibecodeapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">VibeCode </a>(which raised a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-coding-startup-vibecode-helps-build-apps-on-iphone-fundraise-2025-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$9.4 million seed round</a> from Seven Seven Six last year) have emerged to help people build mobile apps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Christina Melas-Kyriazi, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, compared this era of app building to social media and Shopify, “where all of a sudden it was really easy to create content or to create a store online, and then we saw an explosion of small sellers.” she said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-good-enough-for-one-nbsp\">Good enough for one </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, micro apps also have issues. Building and sharing the code with other people can become somewhat expensive given the subscriptions required, especially if all the costs are associated with just one app. Building an app also remains tedious for some. Yu, for example, said her dining app wasn’t hard to create; it was just very time-consuming. She had to lean on ChatGPT and Claude to help her understand some coding decisions. “Once I learned how to prompt and solve issues efficiently, building became much easier,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there are quality issues. Such personal apps may have bugs or critical security flaws — they can’t just be sold as-is to the masses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there is still significant potential in an era of personal app building, especially as AI and model reasoning, quality, and security become more sophisticated over time.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software engineer, Waugh, said he once built an app for a friend who had heart palpitations. He built her a logger that let her record when she was having heart issues so she could more easily show her doctor. “Great example of a one-off personal software that helps you keep track of something important,” he told TechCrunch.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another founder, Nick Simpson, told TechCrunch he was so bad at paying parking tickets — the consequence of San Francisco’s tough parking availability — that he decided to build an app that would automatically pay them after scanning the ticket. As a registered Apple developer, his app is in beta on TestFlight, but he said a bunch of his friends now want it, too.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevertheless, Burge III believes that these types of apps can open “exhilarating opportunities” for businesses and creators to create “hyper-personalized situational experiences.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etherington added to that, saying he believes a day is dawning when people stop subscribing to apps that have monthly fees. Instead, they will just build their own apps for personal use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Melas-Kyriazi, meanwhile, expects to see the use of personal, fleeting apps the same way spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel were once used.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s really going to fill the gap between the spreadsheet and a full-fledged product,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One media strategist, Hollie Krause, said she didn’t like the apps her doctor kept recommending, so she built one herself that can help her track her allergies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She had no technical experience and finished the web app in the same time it took her husband to go to dinner and back. Now, she said, they have two web apps, both built with Claude: one for allergies and sensitivities, and the other to keep tabs on chores around the house.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was like ‘wow I hate Excel but I’d love to make an app for our household,” Krause told TechCrunch. “So, I spun it up and hosted it on Tiiny.host and popped it on our cellphones.”   </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She thinks vibe coding will bring “a lot of innovation and problem solving for communities that wouldn’t have access otherwise,” and hopes to beta-test her allergy health app so she can one day release it to others.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The app will be to help others who struggle to navigate life for themselves, and for caregivers to also be able to have access,” she said. “I truly think that vibe coding means I can help people.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move underscores how India is becoming a key battleground for AI companies looking to expand beyond the U.S. for major growth markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ghose brings deep big-tech operating experience to the role. She spent 24 years at Microsoft before stepping down in December 2025. Her appointment gives Anthropic a seasoned executive with local enterprise and government relationships as it gears up to establish an on-the-ground presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing AI markets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has become one of Anthropic’s most strategically important markets, with the country already ranking as the second-largest user base for Claude and usage heavily skewing toward technical and work-related tasks, including software development. Arch-rival OpenAI is also sharpening its focus on the market with plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">open an office in New Delhi</a> — a sign India is fast becoming one of the most contested arenas in the global race to commercialize generative AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While India offers enormous scale — with more than a billion internet subscribers and over 700 million smartphone users — converting that reach into meaningful revenue has proven difficult, pushing AI companies to experiment with aggressive pricing and promotions. OpenAI last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">introduced ChatGPT Go</a>, its under-$5 plan aimed at attracting Indian users, and later made it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">available free for a year</a> in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar dynamics are playing out for Anthropic: Its Claude app recorded a 48% increase from the previous year in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs, while consumer spending surged 572% to $195,000 for the month, per Appfigures — still modest compared with the U.S., where September spending hit $2.5 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has been stepping up its engagement in India at the highest levels.

Anthropic had also explored a potential partnership with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries to broaden access to Claude, as TechCrunch reported previously. Reliance, however, ultimately struck a deal with Google to offer its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/google-partners-with-ambanis-reliance-to-offer-free-ai-pro-access-to-millions-of-jio-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gemini AI Pro plan free</a> to Jio subscribers. That move came as rival Bharti Airtel partnered with Perplexity to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/perplexity-sees-india-as-a-shortcut-in-its-race-against-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bundle access to its premium subscription</a>, underscoring how India’s telecom giants have become critical distribution gatekeepers in the race to scale consumer AI services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a LinkedIn post announcing the move, Ghose <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/irinaghose_anthropic-appoints-irina-ghose-as-managing-activity-7417774124774912000-WdV3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> she would focus on working with Indian enterprises, developers, and startups adopting Claude for “mission-critical” use cases, pointing to growing demand for what she described as “high-trust, enterprise-grade AI.” She added that AI tailored to local languages could be a “force multiplier” across sectors including education and healthcare — signaling Anthropic’s intent to deepen adoption beyond early tech users into larger institutions and the public sector.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity comes as India’s homegrown GenAI ecosystem remains relatively early-stage. While the country has a deep pool of software talent and a fast-growing base of AI users, it has produced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">few startups building large foundation models</a>, with investors instead largely backing application-layer companies rather than committing the scale of capital typically required to train frontier systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The appointment also comes ahead of India’s AI Impact Summit 2026 in February, where the Indian government is <a href=\"https://impact.indiaai.gov.in/about-summit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expected to bring</a> together AI startups, global CEOs, and industry experts to discuss the next phase of AI deployment in the country. The summit is part of New Delhi’s broader effort to signal support for domestic AI development and position India as a serious player in the global AI landscape, as competition intensifies across major markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is also building out its India team, with <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/careers/jobs?office=4051957008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">job listings</a> for roles including startup and enterprise account executives as well as a partner sales manager, signaling a push to deepen its go-to-market efforts and tap Indian businesses and startups as customers as it expands its presence in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Anthropic, the hire adds senior local leadership as it looks to turn India’s surging usage into a durable business, navigating a market where distribution partnerships, pricing pressure, and enterprise adoption will shape which AI players emerge as long-term winners.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they’ll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals. But those fuzzy feelings didn’t last — Musk left and in 2023 started his own AI company, xAI, and now claims his former partners betrayed their mission by taking billions from Microsoft and restructuring as a for-profit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The relationships have seemingly curdled across the board. OpenAI and Microsoft remain business partners but increasingly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-converts-to-public-benefit-corporation-with-microsoft-taking-27-stake-714a6c05?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcsRqjxh04JRnVv_4FKJp0gjF1PW7VU89bAHJYfBmu25SQkmKVBCVkZYaTZoy0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6969de13&amp;gaa_sig=XRV0gEFvKR3INFyaH_XNuIP7YSTJGI_SzwEFfiTehF2jA3jWLM0_1LB_d3QOEtDRlouLnKGY9CdZEpGOpdarkw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">compete head-to-head</a> in AI. Meanwhile, Musk and Altman have gone from collaborators to archenemies, with OpenAI dismissing Musk’s lawsuit as “baseless” and “harassment” and an attempt to slow it down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The judge found enough evidence to let a jury decide whether OpenAI broke its nonprofit commitments. A jury will also now decide whether Microsoft knowingly helped OpenAI break its promises, though the judge dismissed Musk’s claim that Microsoft unjustly enriched itself at his expense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

These investments will span across semiconductors, energy, and AI “production and innovation,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-restoring-american-semiconductor-manufacturing-leadership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>.

The time period of these investments is unclear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In return, the U.S. will invest in Taiwan’s semiconductor, defense, AI, telecommunications, and biotech industries. The press release did not specify a dollar amount tied to the U.S.’s side of the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes the day after the Trump administration published a proclamation that reiterated the country’s goal to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States and acknowledged the process would take time, as only 10% of semiconductors are produced stateside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated. “Given the foundational role that semiconductors play in the modern economy and national defense, a disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the United States’ industrial and military capabilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proclamation, which announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/the-us-imposes-25-tariff-on-nvidias-h200-ai-chips-headed-to-china/\">25% of tariffs on some advanced AI chips</a>, also stated that once trade talks with other countries — like this deal with Taiwan — are complete, there would be additional semiconductor tariffs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The company says it has now hit a $1.3 billion valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Higgsfield offers a tool that allows consumers, creators, and social media teams to create and edit AI-generated videos. The company was founded by Alex Mashrabov, former head of Generative AI at Snap, who landed at the company after it bought his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/snapchat-quietly-acquired-ai-factory-the-company-behind-its-new-cameos-feature-for-166m/\">previous startup, AI Factory,</a> in 2020 for $166 million. Mashrabov was a co-founder of AI Factory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Five months after Higgsfield launched its tool, it touted 11 million users and said it was a platform of choice for content creators. Nine months in, it has now reached over 15 million users and is on a $200 million annual revenue run rate, with that figure doubling from a $100 million trajectory in about two months, it says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup believes this puts it in rarified growth terrain, outpacing companies like Lovable, Cursor, OpenAI, Slack, and Zoom, according to its <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/higgsfield-announces-130m-series-a-and-reports-200m-annual-run-rate-302661805.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To position itself less as an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/microsofts-nadella-wants-us-to-stop-thinking-of-ai-as-slop/\">AI slop</a> maker and more as a business tool, Higgsfield now emphasizes that the product is primarily used by professional social media marketers, “a major sign that the platform adoption has evolved beyond casual content creation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, it’s still an AI slop engine as well. Last month, Higgsfield was used to create a video called “Island Holiday” that depicted people mentioned in the Epstein files alongside fictional characters on “vacation” on Epstein’s island. (Because of its offensive nature, we’re not going to link to the viral X post.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the other hand, its users also share plenty of projects centered on fashion and Hollywood-esque story telling, as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors in the Series A extension include Accel, AI Capital Partners, Menlo Ventures, and GFT Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
