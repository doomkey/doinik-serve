The activist, who is following the digital side of the Iranian protests from afar, said the campaign targeted people involved in Iran-related activities, such as himself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This hacking campaign comes as Iran grapples with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/irans-internet-shutdown-is-now-one-of-its-longest-ever-as-protests-continue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the longest nationwide internet shutdown in its history</a>, as anti-government protests — and violent crackdowns — rage across the country. Given that Iran and its closest adversaries are highly active in the offensive cyberspace (read: hacking people), we wanted to learn more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gharib shared the full phishing link with TechCrunch soon after his post, allowing us to capture a copy of the source code of the phishing web page used in the attack. He also <a href=\"https://github.com/narimangharib/irgc-whatsapp-phishkit/blob/main/threat-report.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared a write-up of his findings</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch analyzed the source code of the phishing page, and with added input from security researchers, we believe the campaign aimed to steal Gmail and other online credentials, compromise WhatsApp accounts, and conduct surveillance by stealing location data, photos, and audio recordings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is unclear, however, if the hackers were government-linked agents, spies, or cybercriminals — or all three. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch also identified a way to view a real-time copy of all the victims’ responses saved on the attacker’s server, which was left exposed and accessible without a password. This data revealed dozens of victims who had unwittingly entered their credentials into the phishing site and were subsequently likely hacked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The list includes a Middle Eastern academic working in national security studies; the boss of an Israeli drone maker; a senior Lebanese cabinet minister; at least one journalist; and people in the United States or with U.S. phone numbers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch is publishing our findings after validating much of Gharib’s report. The phishing site is now down.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-inside-the-attack-chain\">Inside the attack chain</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Gharib, the WhatsApp message he received contained a suspicious link, which loaded a phishing site in the victim’s browser.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg\" alt=\"two screenshots side by side of a WhatsApp message, showing a malicious link to whatsapp-meeting.duckdns.org.\" class=\"wp-image-3083386\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=430,237 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=720,397 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=900,496 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=800,441 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=668,368 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=708,390 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nariman-post-phishing.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Nariman Gharib</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The link shows that the attackers relied on a dynamic DNS provider called DuckDNS for their phishing campaign. Dynamic DNS providers allow people to connect easy-to-remember web addresses — in this case, a <code>duckdns.org</code> subdomain — to a server where its IP address might frequently change. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear whether the attackers shut down the phishing site of their own accord or were caught and cut off by DuckDNS. We reached out to DuckDNS with inquiries, but its owner Richard Harper requested that we send an abuse report instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From what we understand, the attackers used DuckDNS to mask the real location of the phishing page, presumably to make it look like a genuine WhatsApp link. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phishing page was actually hosted at <code>alex-fabow.online</code>, a domain that was first registered in early November 2025. This domain has several other, related domains hosted on the same dedicated server, and these domain names follow a pattern that suggests the campaign also targeted other providers of virtual meeting rooms, like <code>meet-safe.online</code> and <code>whats-login.online</code>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re not sure what happens while the DuckDNS link loads in the victim’s browser, or how the link determines which specific phishing page to load. It may be that the DuckDNS link redirects the target to a specific phishing page based on information it gleans from the user’s device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phishing page would not load in our web browser, preventing us from directly interacting with it. Reading the source code of the page, however, allowed us to better understand how the attack worked.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gmail credential and phone number phishing</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Depending on the target, tapping on a phishing link would open a fake Gmail login page, or ask for their phone number, and begin an attack flow aimed at stealing their password and two-factor authentication code. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the source code of the phishing page code had at least one flaw: TechCrunch found that by modifying the phishing page’s URL in our web browser, we could view a file on the attacker’s servers that was storing records of every victim who had entered their credentials. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The file contained over 850 records of information submitted by victims during the attack flow. These records detailed each part of the phishing flow that the victim was in. This included copies of the usernames and passwords that victims had entered on the phishing page, as well as incorrect entries and their two-factor codes, effectively serving as a keylogger. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The records also contained each victim’s user agent, a string of text that identifies the operating system and browser versions used to view websites. This data shows that the campaign was designed to target Windows, macOS, iPhone, and Android users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposed file allowed us to follow the attack flow step-by-step for each victim. In one case, the exposed file shows a victim clicking on a malicious link, which opened a page that looked like a Gmail sign-in window. The log shows the victim entering their email credentials several times until they enter the correct password. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The records show the same victim entering their two-factor authentication code sent to them by text message. We can tell this because Google sends two-factor codes in a specific format (usually <code>G-xxxxxx</code>, featuring a six-digit numerical code).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WhatsApp hijack and browser data exfiltration</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond credential theft, this campaign also seemed to enable surveillance by tricking victims into sharing their location, audio, and pictures from their device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Gharib’s case, tapping on the link in the phishing message opened a fake WhatsApp-themed page in his browser, which displayed a QR code. The lure aims to trick the target into scanning the code on their device, purportedly to access a virtual meeting room.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg\" alt=\"a stream of exposed records from the attacker's server, showing reams of attack-flow data, such as sign-ins and the entering of passwords on the phishing page\" class=\"wp-image-3083398\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg 1327w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=768,652 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=680,578 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=1200,1019 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=1280,1087 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=430,365 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=720,611 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=900,764 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=800,679 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=668,567 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=442,375 442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=726,617 726w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=625,531 625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-phishing-data-sample-notes.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1327px) 100vw, 1327px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gharib said the QR code was generated by the attacker, and scanning or tapping it would instantly link the victim’s WhatsApp account to a device controlled by the attacker, granting them access to the victim’s data. This is a long-known attack technique that abuses the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/11/24/spyware-allows-cyber-threat-actors-target-users-messaging-applications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WhatsApp device linking feature</a> and has been similarly abused to <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">target users of messaging app Signal</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We asked <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/granitt-journalist-security/\">Granitt founder Runa Sandvik</a>, a security researcher who works to help secure at-risk individuals, to examine a copy of the phishing page code and see how it functions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sandvik found that when the page loaded, the code would trigger a browser notification asking the user for permission to access their location (via <code>navigator.geolocation</code>), as well as photos and audio (<code>navigator.getUserMedia</code>). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If accepted, the browser would immediately send the person’s coordinates to the attacker, capable of identifying the location of the victim. The page would then continue to share the victim’s location data every few seconds, for as long as the page remained open. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The code also allowed the attackers to record bursts of audio and snap photos every three to five seconds using the device camera. However, we did not see any location data, audio, or images that had been collected on the server.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thoughts on victims, timing, and attribution</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We do not know who is behind this campaign. What is clear is that the campaign was successful in stealing credentials from victims, and it is possible that the phishing campaign could resurface. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite knowing the identities of some of the people in this cluster of victims who were targeted, we don’t have enough information to understand the nature of the campaign. The number of victims hacked by this campaign (that we know of) is fairly low — fewer than 50 individuals — and affects seemingly ordinary people across the Kurdish community, as well as academics, government officials, business leaders, and other senior figures across the broader Iranian diaspora and Middle East.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It may be that there are far more victims than we are aware of, which could help us understand who was targeted and potentially why.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-case-that-this-could-be-a-government-backed-actor\">The case that this could be a government-backed actor</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is unclear what motivated the hackers to steal people’s credentials and hijack their WhatsApp accounts, which could also help identify who is behind this hacking campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A government-backed group, for example, might want to steal the email password and two-factor codes of a high-value target, like a politician or journalist, so they can download private and confidential information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That could make sense since Iran is currently almost entirely cut off from the outside world, and getting information in or out of the country presents a challenge. Both the Iranian government, or a foreign government with interests in Iran’s affairs, could plausibly want to know who influential Iranian-linked individuals are communicating with, and what about.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As such, the timing of this phishing campaign and who it appears to be targeting could point to an espionage campaign aimed at trying to collect information about a narrow list of people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We asked Gary Miller, a security researcher at Citizen Lab and mobile espionage expert, to also review the phishing code and some of the exposed data from the attacker’s server. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Miller said the attack “certainly [had] the hallmarks of an IRGC-linked spearphishing campaign,” referring to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#phishing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">highly targeted email hacks</a> carried out by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a faction of Iran’s military known for carrying out cyberattacks. Miller pointed to a mix of indications, including the international scope of victim targeting, credential theft, the abuse of popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#social-engineering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">social engineering techniques</a> used in the phishing link.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-case-that-this-might-be-a-financially-motivated-actor\">The case that this might be a financially motivated actor</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the other hand, a financially motivated hacker could use the same stolen Gmail password and two-factor code of another high-value target, such as a company executive, to steal proprietary and sensitive business information from their inbox. The hacker could also forcibly reset passwords of their victim’s cryptocurrency and bank accounts to empty their wallets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The campaign’s focus on accessing a victim’s location and device media, however, is unusual for a financially motivated actor, who might have little use for pictures and audio recordings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We asked Ian Campbell, a threat researcher at DomainTools, which helps analyze public internet records, to look at the domain names used in the campaign to help understand when they were first set up, and if these domains were connected to any other previously known or identified infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Campbell found that while the campaign targeted victims in the midst of Iran’s ongoing nationwide protests, its infrastructure had been set up weeks ago. He added that most of the domains connected to this campaign were registered in early November 2025, and one related domain was created months back in August 2025. Campbell described the domains as medium to high risk and said they appear to be linked to a cybercrime operation driven by financial motivations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An additional wrinkle is that Iran’s government has been known to outsource cyberattacks to criminal hacking groups, presumably to shield its involvement in hacking operations against its citizens. The U.S. Treasury has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2292\">sanctioned Iranian companies in the past</a> for acting as fronts for Iran’s IRGC and conducting cyberattacks, such as launching targeted phishing and social engineering attacks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Miller notes, “This drives home the point that clicking on unsolicited WhatsApp links, no matter how convincing, is a high-risk, unsafe practice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>To securely contact this reporter, you can reach out using Signal via the username: zackwhittaker.1337</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai contributed reporting.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The country will initially cap annual imports at 49,000 vehicles. That cap will slowly increase to about 70,000 in around five years, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-canada-carney-xi-beijing-b71c1b67d3489a8b4058c650152b0cb9#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the Associated Press</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a major shift that comes at a time when China is looking to boost EV exports, especially as the European Union weighs <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-weighs-minimum-price-plan-175557306.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lowering its own tariffs on the vehicles</a>. The U.S. remains a holdout on that front, though this week President Trump said he’d be <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/784461/let-china-come-in-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open to Chinese automakers</a> building factories in the U.S. that produce EVs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">China has already been exporting gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles to Mexico, with the latter <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/783051/chinese-ev-export-numbers-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">especially booming in 2025</a>. Many of the leading EV-makers in China have been agitating to enter the U.S. market, including Geely, which held a drive event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. While the company was showcasing a number of models ostensibly meant for the Mexican market, one of its communications executives implied the conglomerate <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/783515/geely-lynk-zeekr-coming-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is aiming to announce an entry</a> into the U.S. in the next two-to-three years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Automotive journalists, influencers, and even some executives — most notably Ford CEO Jim Farley — have praised the quality of Chinese EVs over the last few years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the 100% tariff on Chinese cars has so far made the idea of exporting them to the U.S. a non-starter. That’s despite the fact that Chinese EVs are sold at far lower prices than the average car in the U.S. — a feat typically achieved through a combination of extremely low cost of capital, labor, and a willingness to burn money to gain market share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">China’s ability to undercut other automakers on price is just one concern. The U.S. has spent the last few years trying to separate itself from China’s EV supply chain for national security reasons, under both Presidents Biden and Trump. There are other legal hurdles too. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule restricting the import and sale of <a href=\"https://www.bis.gov/connected-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">certain connected vehicles</a> and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Avery Ash, the CEO of nonprofit Securing America’s Future Energy, cautioned against Trump’s idea of allowing Chinese automakers to build cars in the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere—it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure,” he said in a statement. “We urge the President to stay tough against China and protect American auto manufacturers and workers.” <br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These controversial topics include self-harm, abortion, suicide, and domestic and sexual abuse. YouTube notes that content on child abuse or eating disorders will remain ineligible for full monetization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjX4RqqyCx4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the change this week in a video on its Creator Insider channel.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the past, the degree of graphic or descriptive detail was not considered a significant factor in determining advertiser friendliness, even for some dramatized material,” YouTube explained. “Consequently, such uploads typically received a yellow dollar icon, which restricted their ability to be fully monetized. With this week’s update, our guidelines are becoming more permissive, and creators will be able to earn more ad revenue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Google-owned company says it’s making the change in response to creator feedback that YouTube’s guidelines were leading to limited ad revenue on dramatized and topical content. YouTube notes that it wants to ensure that creators who are telling sensitive stories or producing dramatized content have the opportunity to earn ad revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We took a closer look and found our guidelines in this area had become too restrictive and ended up demonetizing uploads like dramatized content,” YouTube said. “This content might reference topics that advertisers find controversial, but are ultimately comfortable running their ads against. For example, content may be in a fictional context or voiced from personal experiences in passing or in a non-graphic manner. So, as long as the content steers clear of very descriptive or graphic scenes or segments, creators can now earn more ad revenue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as YouTube has been easing up on how it polices content on its platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company told moderators last year to leave up videos that may violate platform rules if they are considered to be in the public interest. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/technology/youtube-videos-content-moderation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The New York Times</a> reported at the time that these videos included discussions of political, social, and cultural issues. The policy shift came at a time when social media platforms were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/meta-officially-says-goodbye-to-its-us-fact-checkers-on-monday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rolling back online speech moderation</a> after President Donald Trump returned to office. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube notes that there are still some areas where ads will remain restricted, as topics like child abuse, including child sex trafficking and eating disorders, are not included in this update. Descriptive segments of those topics or dramatized content around them remain ineligible for ad revenue.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

From January 7, 2026, through January 14, downloads grew to 29,000 — a 49% increase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, cashtags will allow the app to catch up to one of X’s more popular use cases: discussing stocks. To create a cashtag, you place a dollar symbol before the stock ticker symbol (e.g., $AAPL for Apple).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea for cashtags was first introduced by stocks-focused social network Stocktwits, which now has over 10 million users, before the tags were later adopted by Twitter in 2012.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Bluesky says it’s expanding access to the “Live Now” experimental feature that lets users add a temporary “LIVE” badge to their avatar to indicate when they’re streaming online. Currently, this feature only supports Twitch and doesn’t allow anyone to go live directly on Bluesky itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The boost in activity on Bluesky comes after the network saw declines in downloads and usage last year. In April 2025, Appfigures noted that the social networking startup’s downloads <a href=\"https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/20250418?f=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped </a>to new lows, and daily average users on mobile devices had <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/11/07/bluesky-and-x-users-plummet-year-after-trumps-election-win-truth-social-makes-small-gains/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declined nearly 40%</a> by the end of October, per Similarweb data. <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/05/29/bluesky-has-caught-on-with-many-news-influencers-but-x-remains-popular/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pew Research reported last year</a> that a number of influencers now have Bluesky accounts, but they still tend to post more regularly on X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This suggests that the switching costs are higher than some would expect when it comes to swapping out one real-time social network for another. Adding new features will only be part of the battle for Bluesky; it will also have to find a way to get users to change years of ingrained behavior.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Diablo Immortal, for example, offers in-game cosmetics, as well as currency that allows players to accelerate their progression and gain items for crafting, for as much as $200. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the nature of the game, it’s not unusual for many users to repeatedly spend on such items in the course of play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile have player bases in the hundreds of thousands. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The authority is also looking into the games’ parental control features, as the default settings lets minors make in-game purchases, play for long periods without restraints, and allow them to chat with others in-game. The AGCM also highlighted privacy concerns, as the games appear to lead users to select all consent options when signing up, and said it would look into the company’s consent process for harvesting and using personal data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the Authority’s view, the company may be acting in breach of consumer protection rules and, in particular, the duty of professional diligence required in a sector that is particularly sensitive to the risks of gaming-related addiction,” the regulator said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Most are coding web applications, though they are also increasingly vibe coding mobile apps intended to run only on their own personal phones and devices. Some who are already registered as Apple developers are leaving their personal apps in beta on TestFlight.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is a new era of app creation that is sometimes called micro apps, personal apps, or fleeting apps because they are intended to be used only by the creator (or the creator plus a select few other people) and only for as long as the creator wants to keep the app. They are not intended for wide distribution or sale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, founder Jordi Amat told TechCrunch that he built a fleeting web gaming app for his family to play over the holidays and simply shut it down once the vacation was over.   </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s Shamillah Bankiya, a partner at Dawn Capital, who is building a podcast translation web app for personal use. Interestingly enough, Darrell Etherington, a former TechCrunch writer, now a vice president at SBS Comms, is also building his own personal podcast translation app. “A lot of people I know are using Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable to build apps for specific use cases,” he said.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One artist told TechCrunch that he built a “vice tracker” for himself to see how many hookahs and drinks he was consuming each weekend. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even professional developers are vibe coding personal apps. Software engineer James Waugh told TechCrunch he built a web app planning tool to help with his cooking hobby. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-web-apps-and-mobile\">Web apps and mobile</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because tools ranging from Claude Code to Lovable typically don’t require robust coding knowledge just to get to a functional app, we are witnessing the early rise of micro apps. These are apps that are extremely context-specific, address niche needs, and then “disappear when the need is no longer present,” Legand L. Burge III, a professor of computer science at Howard University, said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s similar to how trends on social media appear and then fade away,” Burge III continued. “But now, [it’s] software itself.”   </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yu said she now has six more ideas she wants to code. “It’s really exciting to be alive right now,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some ways, it was always easy for someone without much coding experience to create web apps via no-code platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/no-code-bubble-series-a/\">Bubble</a> and Adalo, which launched before LLMs became popular. What’s new is the rising ability to create personal, temporary apps for mobile devices, too. Also new: the growing realization that anyone can code just by describing, in regular language, the app they want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mobile micro apps still aren’t as easy as their web counterparts. This is because the standard way to load an app on an iPhone is to download it from the App Store, which requires a paid Apple Developer account. But increasingly mobile vibe-coding startups like <a href=\"https://www.create.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anything</a> (which <a href=\"https://www.create.xyz/blog/anything-series-a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised</a> $11 million, led by Footwork) and <a href=\"https://www.vibecodeapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">VibeCode </a>(which raised a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-coding-startup-vibecode-helps-build-apps-on-iphone-fundraise-2025-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$9.4 million seed round</a> from Seven Seven Six last year) have emerged to help people build mobile apps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Christina Melas-Kyriazi, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, compared this era of app building to social media and Shopify, “where all of a sudden it was really easy to create content or to create a store online, and then we saw an explosion of small sellers.” she said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-good-enough-for-one-nbsp\">Good enough for one </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, micro apps also have issues. Building and sharing the code with other people can become somewhat expensive given the subscriptions required, especially if all the costs are associated with just one app. Building an app also remains tedious for some. Yu, for example, said her dining app wasn’t hard to create; it was just very time-consuming. She had to lean on ChatGPT and Claude to help her understand some coding decisions. “Once I learned how to prompt and solve issues efficiently, building became much easier,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there are quality issues. Such personal apps may have bugs or critical security flaws — they can’t just be sold as-is to the masses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there is still significant potential in an era of personal app building, especially as AI and model reasoning, quality, and security become more sophisticated over time.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software engineer, Waugh, said he once built an app for a friend who had heart palpitations. He built her a logger that let her record when she was having heart issues so she could more easily show her doctor. “Great example of a one-off personal software that helps you keep track of something important,” he told TechCrunch.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another founder, Nick Simpson, told TechCrunch he was so bad at paying parking tickets — the consequence of San Francisco’s tough parking availability — that he decided to build an app that would automatically pay them after scanning the ticket. As a registered Apple developer, his app is in beta on TestFlight, but he said a bunch of his friends now want it, too.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevertheless, Burge III believes that these types of apps can open “exhilarating opportunities” for businesses and creators to create “hyper-personalized situational experiences.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etherington added to that, saying he believes a day is dawning when people stop subscribing to apps that have monthly fees. Instead, they will just build their own apps for personal use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Melas-Kyriazi, meanwhile, expects to see the use of personal, fleeting apps the same way spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel were once used.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s really going to fill the gap between the spreadsheet and a full-fledged product,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One media strategist, Hollie Krause, said she didn’t like the apps her doctor kept recommending, so she built one herself that can help her track her allergies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She had no technical experience and finished the web app in the same time it took her husband to go to dinner and back. Now, she said, they have two web apps, both built with Claude: one for allergies and sensitivities, and the other to keep tabs on chores around the house.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was like ‘wow I hate Excel but I’d love to make an app for our household,” Krause told TechCrunch. “So, I spun it up and hosted it on Tiiny.host and popped it on our cellphones.”   </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She thinks vibe coding will bring “a lot of innovation and problem solving for communities that wouldn’t have access otherwise,” and hopes to beta-test her allergy health app so she can one day release it to others.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The app will be to help others who struggle to navigate life for themselves, and for caregivers to also be able to have access,” she said. “I truly think that vibe coding means I can help people.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move underscores how India is becoming a key battleground for AI companies looking to expand beyond the U.S. for major growth markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ghose brings deep big-tech operating experience to the role. She spent 24 years at Microsoft before stepping down in December 2025. Her appointment gives Anthropic a seasoned executive with local enterprise and government relationships as it gears up to establish an on-the-ground presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing AI markets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has become one of Anthropic’s most strategically important markets, with the country already ranking as the second-largest user base for Claude and usage heavily skewing toward technical and work-related tasks, including software development. Arch-rival OpenAI is also sharpening its focus on the market with plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">open an office in New Delhi</a> — a sign India is fast becoming one of the most contested arenas in the global race to commercialize generative AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While India offers enormous scale — with more than a billion internet subscribers and over 700 million smartphone users — converting that reach into meaningful revenue has proven difficult, pushing AI companies to experiment with aggressive pricing and promotions. OpenAI last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">introduced ChatGPT Go</a>, its under-$5 plan aimed at attracting Indian users, and later made it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">available free for a year</a> in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar dynamics are playing out for Anthropic: Its Claude app recorded a 48% increase from the previous year in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs, while consumer spending surged 572% to $195,000 for the month, per Appfigures — still modest compared with the U.S., where September spending hit $2.5 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has been stepping up its engagement in India at the highest levels. Chief executive Dario Amodei <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">visited</a> in October and met corporate executives and lawmakers, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss the company’s expansion plans and growing adoption of its tools. Anthropic had also explored a potential partnership with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries to broaden access to Claude, as TechCrunch reported previously. Reliance, however, ultimately struck a deal with Google to offer its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/google-partners-with-ambanis-reliance-to-offer-free-ai-pro-access-to-millions-of-jio-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gemini AI Pro plan free</a> to Jio subscribers. That move came as rival Bharti Airtel partnered with Perplexity to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/perplexity-sees-india-as-a-shortcut-in-its-race-against-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bundle access to its premium subscription</a>, underscoring how India’s telecom giants have become critical distribution gatekeepers in the race to scale consumer AI services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a LinkedIn post announcing the move, Ghose <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/irinaghose_anthropic-appoints-irina-ghose-as-managing-activity-7417774124774912000-WdV3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> she would focus on working with Indian enterprises, developers, and startups adopting Claude for “mission-critical” use cases, pointing to growing demand for what she described as “high-trust, enterprise-grade AI.” She added that AI tailored to local languages could be a “force multiplier” across sectors including education and healthcare — signaling Anthropic’s intent to deepen adoption beyond early tech users into larger institutions and the public sector.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity comes as India’s homegrown GenAI ecosystem remains relatively early-stage. While the country has a deep pool of software talent and a fast-growing base of AI users, it has produced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">few startups building large foundation models</a>, with investors instead largely backing application-layer companies rather than committing the scale of capital typically required to train frontier systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The appointment also comes ahead of India’s AI Impact Summit 2026 in February, where the Indian government is <a href=\"https://impact.indiaai.gov.in/about-summit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expected to bring</a> together AI startups, global CEOs, and industry experts to discuss the next phase of AI deployment in the country. The summit is part of New Delhi’s broader effort to signal support for domestic AI development and position India as a serious player in the global AI landscape, as competition intensifies across major markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is also building out its India team, with <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/careers/jobs?office=4051957008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">job listings</a> for roles including startup and enterprise account executives as well as a partner sales manager, signaling a push to deepen its go-to-market efforts and tap Indian businesses and startups as customers as it expands its presence in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Anthropic, the hire adds senior local leadership as it looks to turn India’s surging usage into a durable business, navigating a market where distribution partnerships, pricing pressure, and enterprise adoption will shape which AI players emerge as long-term winners.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they’ll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals.

These investments will span across semiconductors, energy, and AI “production and innovation,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-restoring-american-semiconductor-manufacturing-leadership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>. Taiwan currently produces <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/06/taiwans-dominance-of-the-chip-industry-makes-it-more-important\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than half</a> of the world’s semiconductors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taiwan will also supply an additional $250 billion in credit guarantees for additional investments from these semiconductors and tech enterprises, according to the commerce department. The time period of these investments is unclear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In return, the U.S. will invest in Taiwan’s semiconductor, defense, AI, telecommunications, and biotech industries. The press release did not specify a dollar amount tied to the U.S.’s side of the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes the day after the Trump administration published a proclamation that reiterated the country’s goal to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States and acknowledged the process would take time, as only 10% of semiconductors are produced stateside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated. “Given the foundational role that semiconductors play in the modern economy and national defense, a disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the United States’ industrial and military capabilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proclamation, which announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/the-us-imposes-25-tariff-on-nvidias-h200-ai-chips-headed-to-china/\">25% of tariffs on some advanced AI chips</a>, also stated that once trade talks with other countries — like this deal with Taiwan — are complete, there would be additional semiconductor tariffs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The company says it has now hit a $1.3 billion valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Higgsfield offers a tool that allows consumers, creators, and social media teams to create and edit AI-generated videos. The company was founded by Alex Mashrabov, former head of Generative AI at Snap, who landed at the company after it bought his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/snapchat-quietly-acquired-ai-factory-the-company-behind-its-new-cameos-feature-for-166m/\">previous startup, AI Factory,</a> in 2020 for $166 million. Mashrabov was a co-founder of AI Factory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Five months after Higgsfield launched its tool, it touted 11 million users and said it was a platform of choice for content creators. Nine months in, it has now reached over 15 million users and is on a $200 million annual revenue run rate, with that figure doubling from a $100 million trajectory in about two months, it says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup believes this puts it in rarified growth terrain, outpacing companies like Lovable, Cursor, OpenAI, Slack, and Zoom, according to its <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/higgsfield-announces-130m-series-a-and-reports-200m-annual-run-rate-302661805.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To position itself less as an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/microsofts-nadella-wants-us-to-stop-thinking-of-ai-as-slop/\">AI slop</a> maker and more as a business tool, Higgsfield now emphasizes that the product is primarily used by professional social media marketers, “a major sign that the platform adoption has evolved beyond casual content creation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, it’s still an AI slop engine as well. Last month, Higgsfield was used to create a video called “Island Holiday” that depicted people mentioned in the Epstein files alongside fictional characters on “vacation” on Epstein’s island. (Because of its offensive nature, we’re not going to link to the viral X post.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the other hand, its users also share plenty of projects centered on fashion and Hollywood-esque story telling, as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors in the Series A extension include Accel, AI Capital Partners, Menlo Ventures, and GFT Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The previous longest shutdowns in the country lasted around 163 hours in 2019, and 160 hours in 2025, according to Isik Mater, the director of research at NetBlocks, a web monitoring company that tracks internet disruptions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mater said that the current shutdown in Iran is the third longest on record, after the internet shutdown in Sudan in mid-2021 that lasted around 35 days, followed by the outage in Mauritania in July 2024, which lasted 22 days. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Iran’s shutdowns remain among the most comprehensive and tightly enforced nationwide blackouts we’ve observed, particularly in terms of population affected,” Mater told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exact ranking depends on how each organization measures a shutdown. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zach Rosson, a researcher who studies internet disruptions at the digital rights nonprofit Access Now, told TechCrunch that according to its data, the ongoing shutdown in Iran is on a path to crack <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZoKkFiaRVocWJm_Kb7Jd8jE2fsFWr_7HJo1VJlzmuw/edit?gid=0#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the top 10 longest shutdowns in history</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iran’s government has a long track record of shutting down access to the internet at times of protest and civil unrest, often making it more difficult to monitor the protests from outside of the country. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A U.S.-based human rights group <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-nuclear-us-what-to-know-explainer-845b3ac10c37727add7118ec9c2f6e46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">estimates</a> that there have been more than 600 protests in cities across Iran, and according to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/iran-protests-updates-1-13-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one estimate</a>, the Iranian government’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/world/middleeast/iran-protester-deaths.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">violent crackdown</a> has led to the deaths of at least 2,000 people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/?p=3081251\">shutdown in Iran on January 8</a> was sudden, cutting government institutions like the foreign ministry from the internet.

The tariff only applies to certain semiconductors, including the Nvidia H200 advanced AI chips set to ship to China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-action-on-certain-advanced-computing-chips-to-protect-americas-economic-and-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed a proclamation</a> on Wednesday that entailed a 25% tariff on advanced AI semiconductors that have been produced outside the U.S. and then pass through the U.S. before being exported to customers in other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This news formalizes a key component of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision to give Nvidia the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/department-of-commerce-may-approve-nvidia-h200-chip-exports-to-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">green light to start shipping its H200 advanced AI chips</a> to vetted customers in China in December.

Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson emailed TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/nvidia-is-reportedly-weighs-ramping-up-h200-production-to-meet-surging-demand-in-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">demand for these H200 semiconductors</a>. Nvidia was reportedly considering ramping up production on these chips due to a rush of early orders from Chinese companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Demand is just one factor, though.

Seth Bannon, a founding partner at Fifty Years, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/sethbannon/status/2011825675963916291\">wrote on X</a> that Merge represents the culmination of the human effort to build tools that “extend ourselves and our capabilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our individual experience of the world arises from billions of active neurons,” reads a statement from Merge Labs. “If we can interface with these neurons at scale, we could restore lost abilities, support healthier brain states, deepen our connection with each other, and expand what we can imagine and create alongside advanced AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merge Labs said it intends to reach these feats noninvasively by developing “entirely new technologies that connect with neurons using molecules instead of electrodes” to “transit and receive information using deep-reaching modalities like ultrasound.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move deepens <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Altman’s competition with Elon Musk,</a> whose startup Neuralink is also developing computer interface chips that allow people who suffer from severe paralysis to control devices with their thoughts.

This is why OpenAI is participating in Merge Labs’ seed round.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from Altman, other co-founders include Alex Blania (CEO) and Sandro Herbig (product and engineering lead) at Tools for Humanity, another Altman-backed company (and creator of the eye-scanning World orbs); Tyson Aflalo and Sumner Norman, co-founders of implantable neural tech company Forest Neurotech; and Mikhail Shapiro, a researcher at Caltech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blania and <a href=\"https://x.com/sandroherbig/status/2011827239726498299\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Herbig</a> said in separate <a href=\"https://x.com/alexblania/status/2011830523619131851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">social media posts</a> that they would continue their roles at Tools for Humanity. Merge Labs did not confirm whether Alfalo and Norman would maintain their positions at Forest Neurotech, only saying that the company would continue operating and will have a “wonderful working relationship” with Merge. Shapiro intends to continue teaching at Caltech.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson told TechCrunch that the co-founders are also Merge Labs’ board members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, OpenAI will work with Merge Labs on scientific foundation models and other frontier tools to “accelerate progress.” In its blog post, OpenAI noted that AI will not only help accelerate R&amp;D in bioengineering, neuroscience, and device engineering, but that the interfaces will also benefit from AI operating systems that “can interpret intent, adapt to individuals, and operate reliably with limited and noisy signals.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, Merge Labs could function as a remote control for OpenAI’s software. That leads into the circular nature of the deal: If Merge Labs succeeds, it could drive more users to OpenAI, which then justifies OpenAI’s investment into the company. It also increases the value of a startup Altman owns using resources from a company he runs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is also working with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/05/openai-and-jony-ive-may-be-struggling-to-figure-out-their-ai-device/\">Jony Ive’s startup io</a>, which it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquired</a> last year, to produce a piece of AI hardware that doesn’t rely on a screen. Recent <a href=\"https://x.com/koltregaskes/status/2011339755246731574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unconfirmed leaks</a> suggest the device might be an earbud. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI primarily invests through the OpenAI Startup Fund, which has invested in several other startups connected to Altman, including Red Queen Bio, Rain AI, and Harvey. OpenAI has also entered into commercial agreements with startups Altman personally owns or chairs, including nuclear fusion startup Helion Energy and nuclear fission company Oklo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman has been dreaming about the “merge” — the idea that humans and machines will merge — since at least 2017 when he published a <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> guessing it would happen somewhere between 2025 and 2075. He also speculated that the merge could take many forms, including plugging electrons into our brains or becoming “really close friends with a chatbot.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said a merge is our “best-case scenario” for humanity surviving against superintelligence AI, which he describes as a separate species that’s in conflict with humans. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder,” Altman wrote. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI and Merge Labs for more information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to confirm that Merge Labs’ founders will continue work at their respective companies</em>,<em> and with more details about other fund participants. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Developed by the foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise allows large-scale reuse and distribution of Wikipedia content, as well as content from other Wikimedia projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the previously announced <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2022/06/21/wikimedia-enterprise-announces-google-and-internet-archive-first-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnership with Google in 2022</a>, the organization shared publicly for the first time that it has formed other partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity over the past year. Other partnerships, like Ecosia, Pleias, and ProRata, have been mentioned before but are also included in this announcement, along with Nomic and Reef Media.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These deals give Wikipedia another way to sustain itself in an age where much of its content is being picked up and reused by AI models and other technology products and services to provide quick, factual answers to consumers’ queries. As an enterprise product, Wikimedia Enterprise isn’t just about getting tech companies to pay for their use; it also provides them access to Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed designed to meet their data needs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The foundation also <a href=\"https://enterprise.wikimedia.com/blog/wikipedia-25-enterprise-partners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">noted</a> in a blog post that Wikipedia today is among the top 10 most-visited websites globally, where audiences view more than 65 million articles in over 300 languages, nearly 15 billion times per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever,” noted Wikimedia Foundation’s CPO/CTO, Selena Deckelmann, in a statement. “With continued help from readers, volunteer editors, donors, partners, and fans across the globe, Wikipedia will remain the crucial hub for human-powered knowledge and collaboration online for the next 25 years and beyond.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the tech deals announcement, the foundation launched a birthday campaign, which includes a new video docuseries offering a behind-the-scenes look at Wikipedia volunteers around the world. It also launched a “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule to explore the site’s past, present, and future, with some narration provided by founder Jimmy Wales. The organization will celebrate a livestreamed birthday event as well, on January 15, at 4:00 p.m. UTC, with guests, games, and entertainment. The event can be found on Wikipedia’s YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram channels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The organization’s birthday announcements additionally highlighted other recent advances, like upgrades to its tech infrastructure, its own <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/04/30/our-new-ai-strategy-puts-wikipedias-humans-first/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">approach to AI,</a> <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-experiments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new experiments</a> like games and short-form video, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Absent any changes, the world could face a severe shortfall <a href=\"https://press.spglobal.com/2026-01-08-Substantial-Shortfall-in-Copper-Supply-Widens-as-the-Race-for-AI-and-Growing-Defense-Spending-Add-to-Accelerating-Demand,-New-S-P-Global-Study-Finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as early as 2040</a>, with demand exceeding supply by as much as 25%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If copper seems expensive today, just wait a few years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies and investors have been pouring money into the sector as demand ramps up. AI minerals startup KoBold, for example, raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/02/kobold-used-ai-to-find-copper-now-investors-are-piling-in-to-the-tune-of-537m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$537 million last year</a> to exploit a copper deposit it found in Zambia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But with a little help from some microbes, today’s copper producers might be able to beat the shortage. One startup, <a href=\"https://transitionmetal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Transition Metal Solutions</a>, says it has found a way to boost copper production by 20% to 30% using additives to boost the microbes’ performance. Think of it as prebiotics for copper mines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To scale up its technology, Transition Metal Solutions has raised a $6 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Transition Ventures with participation from Astor Management AG, Climate Capital, Dolby Family Ventures, Essential Capital, Juniper VC, Kayak Ventures, New Climate Ventures, Possible Ventures, SOSV, and Understorey Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microbes have always been key players in the copper world, helping the metal break out of its mineral form so that we can refine it into pure metal. Companies have been working for years to coax microbes into squeezing more copper out of ore, but according to Sasha Milshteyn, co-founder and CEO of Transition, they’ve been going about it the wrong way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Typically, companies isolate or engineer strains that show promise in boosting copper production. They grow large quantities of them and pour them over an ore heap, where the microbes soak in and get to work.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That by and large hasn’t paid off,” Milshteyn told TechCrunch. “Often they will see kind of a boost early on and then it just kind of falls off — or they don’t see any boost at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Milshteyn suspects that part of the problem is that microbes aren’t solo actors. It’s like casting a star without a supporting cast. Microbes live in diverse communities where each plays a role. Bumping up the population of one strain can only do so much.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another part of the problem is that we’ve only scratched the surface on understanding microbes in ore heaps. “When you look into the microbial community that’s present in the material, typically well over 90% of it are things that we’ve never seen before,” Milshteyn said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conditions inside a heap leach, as the acid-laced piles of ore are called, are challenging to replicate in a lab. The pH is low, around 2, and there are clays and other metals floating around, all of which undermine the usual molecular tools scientists use to understand microbial communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everything that the industry has done has really focused on that tiny fraction that people have been able to grow in the lab,” he said. “Typically, it’s in the 5% range that you can culture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So instead of trying to isolate a few star performers, Transition is working to raise the entire community up. The company applies low-cost, mostly inorganic compounds that are already found at mining sites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’re focused on is not necessarily boosting one or two species, but we’re trying to nudge the community towards the higher functional state,” he said. “We’ve observed that in the lab.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In lab samples that Transition has applied its proprietary cocktail to, the startup has been able to extract 90% of the copper from the ore, up from 60% using traditional methods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of the lab, Milshteyn expects the efficacy to drop a bit, though not by much. Traditional heap leaches extract around 30% to 60% of the copper in the ore. He thinks Transition can bring that up to at least 50% to 70%, maybe higher. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each mine has a different microbial community, so Transition plans to tailor its additives based on initial testing. As the company gathers more data, Milshteyn thinks that eventually he and his team will be able to predict what a mine needs in advance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that rate, the company’s prebiotics could solve the copper shortage before it starts. But first, Transition has to show the mining industry that its solution works. The company plans to work with a third-party metallurgy lab that’s known within the mining world. “Without third party results, nobody’s going to believe you,” Milshteyn said. Money from the seed round should cover that phase of testing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Transition has proven it works in the lab, then it’ll apply its treatment to a demonstration heap containing tens of thousands of tons of material. With luck, it’ll then deploy its technology at copper mines around the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re leaving 65% of material behind” at typical mines, Milshteyn said. “We may as well get as much out of it as we can.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: The article previously referred to Transition’s additives as probiotics instead of prebiotics.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We also prohibit soliciting this content from others, sharing links to “nudify” apps, or discussing how to create this content on other platforms,” the spokesperson added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alphabet, Snap, TikTok, and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter demands the companies provide: </p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Policy definitions of “deepfake” content, “non-consensual intimate imagery,” or similar terms.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Descriptions of the companies’ policies and enforcement approach for nonconsensual AI deepfakes of peoples’ bodies, non-nude pictures, altered clothing, and “virtual undressing.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Descriptions of current content policies addressing edited media and explicit content, as well as internal guidance provided to moderators.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">How current policies govern AI tools and image generators as they relate to suggestive or intimate content.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">What filters, guardrails, or measures have been implemented to prevent the generation and distribution of deepfakes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Which mechanisms the companies use to identify deepfake content and prevent them from being re-uploaded.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">How they prevent users from profiting from such content.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">How the platforms prevent themselves from monetizing nonconsensual AI-generated content.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">How the companies’ terms of service enable them to ban or suspend users who post deepfakes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">What the companies do to notify victims of nonconsensual sexual deepfakes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter is signed by Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes just a day after xAI’s owner Elon Musk said that he was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“not aware</a> of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Later on Wednesday, California’s attorney general <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">opened an investigation</a> into xAI’s chatbot, following mounting pressure from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">governments across the world</a> incensed by the lack of guardrails around Grok that allowed this to happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI has <a href=\"https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">maintained</a> that it takes action to remove “illegal content on X, including [CSAM] and non-consensual nudity,” though neither the company nor Musk have addressed the fact that Grok was allowed to generate such content in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem isn’t constrained to nonconsensual manipulated sexualized imagery either. While not all AI-based image generation and editing services let users “undress” people, they do let one easily generate deepfakes. To pick a few examples, OpenAI’s Sora 2 reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-using-sora-2-to-make-child-fetish-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">allowed users to generate explicit videos</a> featuring children; Google’s Nano Banana seemingly <a href=\"https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/charlie-kirks-nano-banana-figurine-sparks-backlash-x-account-suspended-as-public-calls-for-fbi-intervention/articleshow/124044298.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">generated</a> an image showing Charlie Kirk being shot; and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/697188/racist-ai-generated-videos-google-veo-3-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">racist videos</a> made with Google’s AI video model are garnering millions of views on social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue grows even more complex when Chinese image and video generators come into the picture. Many Chinese tech companies and apps — especially those linked to ByteDance — offer easy ways to edit faces, voices, and videos, and those outputs have spread to Western social platforms. China has stronger synthetic content labeling requirements that don’t exist in the U.S. on the federal level, where the masses instead rely on fragmented and dubiously enforced policies from the platforms themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. lawmakers have already passed some legislation seeking to rein in deepfake pornography, but the impact has been limited. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/trump-signs-bill-criminalizing-revenge-porn-and-explicit-deepfakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Take It Down Act</a>, which became federal law in May, is meant to criminalize the creation and dissemination of nonconsensual, sexualized imagery. But <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/a-new-jersey-lawsuit-shows-how-hard-it-is-to-fight-deepfake-porn/\">a number of provisions in the law</a> make it difficult to hold image-generating platforms accountable, as they focus most of the scrutiny on individual users instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, a number of states are trying to take matters into their own hands to protect consumers and elections. This week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-proposals-protect-consumers-and-workers\">New York governor </a><a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-proposals-protect-consumers-and-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kathy Hochul</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-proposals-protect-consumers-and-workers\"> proposed laws</a> that would require AI-generated content to be labeled as such, and ban nonconsensual deepfakes in specified periods leading up to elections, including depictions of opposition candidates.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
