The company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/education/practice-sat-gemini/\">announced </a>that it’s now focusing its AI education efforts on standardized testing with free SAT practice exams powered by Gemini. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Students can prompt Gemini by typing “I want to take a practice SAT test,” and the AI will provide them with a free practice exam. Gemini then analyzes the results, highlighting strengths and identifying areas that need further review. It also offers detailed explanations for any incorrect answers. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085165\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg 1576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=1200,655 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=1280,698 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=430,235 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=720,393 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=900,491 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=800,437 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=1536,838 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=668,365 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=1131,617 1131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=708,386 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-1.27.15-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it partnered with education companies like The Princeton Review to ensure the content is vetted and that students are working with questions that closely mirror what they will encounter on the actual SAT.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This recent move by Google is viewed as a game-changer for students who can’t readily access personalized SAT tutoring. By making SAT prep free, Google is trying to open the door for more students to compete on equal footing. However, it also sparks a broader conversation about the role of AI in education and just how much we want AI to shape how students learn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The adoption of AI in education is not without controversy. Many teachers worry that students might end up leaning too heavily on tools like Gemini and ChatGPT to get their work done. If students let AI do all the thinking, it could chip away at their problem-solving skills. There are even <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1\">studies</a> out there that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6\">back this up</a>, suggesting that relying too much on AI can actually weaken students’ ability to think critically and tackle challenges on their own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s also not forget about human SAT tutors. Free AI-powered exam prep poses a significant threat to the traditional tutoring industry, which has long thrived on providing personalized coaching to college-bound students. With Google offering a free alternative, the job security of private SAT tutors may be at risk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This news follows Google’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/google-classrooms-new-tool-uses-gemini-to-transform-lessons-into-podcast-episodes/\">recent launch</a> of a Gemini-powered feature that lets teachers create podcast-style audio lessons, which could help catch the attention of Gen Z students.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenny-liu-22b08b4a/\">Jenny Liu</a>, former CEO of exclusive, celebrity-favorite gym Dogpound, said there were two reasons she wanted to start her own venture fund. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one, she was surrounded by wellness founders at her local gym who loved testing new products and building community. Second, Liu also realized that many of these founders, especially women and minorities, were struggling to fund their ideas due to limited access to founder networks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To bridge this gap, she launched <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.crushitventures.com/\">Crush It Ventures</a>, a wellness-focused early-stage fund. The firm hopes to back companies building across the wellness sector, including in mental health, fitness and sport, beauty, and hospitality. On Thursday, it announced the final close of a $5 million Fund I. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The wellness industry often overlaps with the health sector (like sleep and body health), making it quite hard to estimate how big it truly is. Nonetheless, wellness trends have been booming in the past few years. Gyms have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/27/gen-z-exercise-healthy-pub-gym-benefits\">become a Gen Z obsession</a>, and so have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/27/running-gen-z-boom-athletics-london-marathon\">run clubs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A McKinsey <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/future-of-wellness-trends\">study from last year found </a>that the U.S. alone spends more than $500 billion a year on wellness. Young people in particular have become big spenders as they continue to openly talk about mental health and burnout. The McKinsey report said that though Gen Z makes up 36% of the adult U.S. population, they are responsible for over 41% of wellness spending. This is compared to those 58 and older, who make up around 35% of the U.S. population, yet account for 28% of wellness spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu believes this area has become so popular because people are realizing that health is more than just physical fitness — it also involves mental, emotional, and social well-being. “As we automate more with technology in our daily lives, we’re valuing experiences and products that foster real connection and long-term well-being,” she said. “It’s also a reflection of shifting values: younger generations want purpose-driven brands and are craving real community.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu said she started raising the fund in 2024. Though the environment was “cautious,” she said, there was a growing interest in wellness, “especially from LPs looking for more diverse mission-driven funds,” she told TechCrunch. The environment for new funds <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/us-venture-capital-firm-concentration-first-half-2025-founders-fund\">is still tough </a>(especially <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2025/10/17/women-led-vc-funds-rise-equity\">for a woman solo GP</a>) as most of the capital continues to flow to the top firms.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu declined to share the name of the LPs in the fund but said she was able to break through as a new fund manager by leaning into her network. She has a background in banking before angel investing in the gym, later joining as CFO. During her decade there, she was CEO for two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Dogpound, she worked with founders and celebrities around the world. “I learned that brand building is not just about marketing a product or service, but about creating a space for shared experiences, joy, and genuine connection,” she said, adding that her fund is keen on helping founders build their brand and communities as they scale their businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crush It plans to typically write checks of $100,000 to $250,000, and invest in between 20 and 25 companies, she said. So far, the firm has invested in 18 companies, like the wearable tech company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://elemindtech.com/products/elemind?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=23139288858&amp;utm_content=784712397806&amp;utm_term=elemind&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23139288858&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9S6XYNdXN6WYfKknWVw43BgHBynB&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAj8LLBhAkEiwAJjbY7wiX6SiwUp-QRndjMZ7mA6c9DzCG6e6V2jQWPg2vjdP7mLpNGXT92xoCWaEQAvD_BwE\">Elemind</a> and CPG business <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://drinkcaliwater.com/\">Caliwater</a>. She hopes to deploy all of the checks within the next 12-18 months. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to help close the gap in wellness funding for underrepresented founders, build stronger founder networks, and show that purpose and community-driven companies can scale and make a meaningful difference in health and lifestyle,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a significant change in fortunes for a company whose CEO wrote a public letter just last year pleading for funding.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the deal closes as planned, General Fusion could receive up to $335 million from the transaction, more than double what it was reportedly seeking to raise last year before it landed the $22 million lifeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transaction will value the combined company at about $1 billion, General Fusion said. Before the merger was announced. The fusion startup, which was founded in 2002, had previously <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">raised over $440 million</a>, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Fusion plans to use the money to complete its demonstration reactor, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/general-fusion-fires-up-its-newest-steampunk-fusion-reactor/\">Lawson Machine 26</a> (LM26). The device uses an approach called “inertial confinement,” which works by compressing a fuel pellet until its atoms fuse together, releasing energy in the process. The National Ignition Facility used inertial confinement in its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/17/laser-powered-fusion-experiment-more-than-doubles-its-power-output/\">successful fusion experiments</a>, using lasers to bombard the fuel pellets to unleash the compressive force.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LM26 eschews the lasers, though. Instead, it uses steam-driven pistons that drive a wall of liquid lithium metal inward to compress the fuel pellet. That liquid lithium then circulates through a heat exchanger, which generates steam to spin a generator. By avoiding expensive lasers or superconducting magnets, which are required in other fusion reactor designs, General Fusion hopes to build a fusion power plant for less money. But first the company has to prove its approach is viable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, before it revealed its financial problems, General Fusion said that in 2026, LM26 would hit scientific breakeven, in which a fusion reaction generates more power than was required to start it. Scientific breakeven is a key milestone, though distinct from and easier to attain than commercial breakeven, in which fusion reactions release enough energy to export electricity to the grid. General Fusion did not reply to a request asking if its timeline had changed.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition company, Spring Valley, is something of a specialist in reverser mergers with energy companies. It previously took NuScale Power, a small modular nuclear reactor company, public in a deal whose stock price has since fallen more than 50% from its peak last year. The firm is also in the midst of completing a merger with Eagle Energy Metals, a uranium mining company that’s also supposedly developing its own SMR.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Fusion isn’t the first fusion company to go public. In December, TAE Technologies announced it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/trump-media-is-merging-with-fusion-power-company-tae-technologies-in-6b-deal/\">merge with Trump Media &amp; Technology Group</a> in a deal valuing the combined company at more than $6 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The common thread connecting these deals is data centers, of course. They’re expected to consume <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\">nearly 300% more power by 2035</a>, according to BloombergNEF, and General Fusion explicitly points to rising data center energy demand in its <a href=\"https://generalfusion.com/post/general-fusion-business-combination-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">merger announcement</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the company also pointed to broader electrification trends, including EVs and electric heating, that could increase overall electricity demand by up to 50% by 2035. It’s a reminder that, while the Trump administration has cast doubts on an electrified future, other countries are charging ahead. While General Fusion may face technological challenges, trends in the energy world suggest that if it can deliver fusion power at a reasonable cost, it will find plenty of willing buyers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Waymo first opened its robotaxis to the general public in Phoenix in 2020. It expanded to San Francisco and Los Angeles and eventually <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/now-anyone-in-la-can-hail-a-waymo-robotaxi/\">opened it to all riders </a>in 2024. As the company continued to expand in those metro areas — pushing into the larger Bay Area and into Silicon Valley, for example — it also opened in new markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo opened a robotaxi service in spring 2025 in partnership with Uber <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/uber-and-waymos-commercial-robotaxi-service-is-open-for-business-in-atlanta/\">in Atlanta</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/uber-users-in-austin-are-getting-matched-with-waymo-robotaxis/\">Austin</a>, and expanded its service area in existing markets to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-giving-rides-on-freeways-in-these-3-cities/\">include freeways</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has laid out an aggressive plan to bring its robotaxi service to nearly a dozen more cities over the next year. Those plans include Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, London, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The company has already started testing in some of those cities using a mix of its all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles and newer Zeekr RT vans that have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/waymo-is-rebranding-its-zeekr-robotaxi/\">rebranded “Ojai.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last October that “by the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion hasn’t been without problems. Residents in cities like San Francisco have captured video of Waymo vehicles creating traffic jams, notably during a widespread power outage in December. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has also gotten the attention of federal safety regulators.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opened an initial investigation</a> into the company last October over how its robotaxis operated around a stopped school bus in Atlanta. School district officials in Austin have shared video and complaints around the same issue of Waymo moving past school buses even when the lights are on and the stop sign is deployed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has issued a voluntary software recall to fix that issue. However, new videos, which show Waymos illegally passing school buses, suggest the problem has not been resolved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br><br><br><br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Communications encrypted in this way are generally speaking only accessible if authorities hack into a target’s devices, both remotely using government-grade spyware, or locally <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/serbian-police-used-cellebrite-to-unlock-then-plant-spyware-on-a-journalists-phone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using forensic technology</a> like Cellebrite devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement specifically mentions that the new law will cover “all forms of communications, whether encrypted or not,” and can be used to obtain both content of communications and related <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#metadata\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">metadata</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about government spyware?

But there is a specific section that mentions the need for “a new legal basis for the use of covert surveillance software as an alternative means of lawful interception to gain access to electronic devices” — a clear reference to computer and mobile spyware — to investigate serious crimes. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-state-of-spyware-in-europe\">The state of spyware in Europe</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ireland’s bid to allow its law enforcement to use spyware comes as government spyware continues to proliferate, including across Europe, despite recent abuses that have highlighted how spyware has been used to violate human rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a decade ago most spyware scandals had been largely limited to countries in the Middle East and South America, where the standards of human rights vary wildly, there have been several cases of abuse of spyware in Europe in recent years, including in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced56p5l2wwo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Greece</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/hungarian-journalists-targeted-with-pegasus-spyware-to-sue-state\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hungary</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/researchers-confirm-two-journalists-were-hacked-with-paragon-spyware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Italy</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/poland-nso-pegasus-election/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Poland</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet, spyware has been used in Europe for more than two decades. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2004, in what may be the first documented government spyware sale, the Italian cybercrime unit Polizia Postale signed its first contract with Hacking Team, at the time a small cybersecurity startup in Milan, whose name would go on to become synonymous with a data breach that resulted in the company’s shutting down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Later in 2007, Jörg Ziercke, the head of the German’s federal criminal police office, the Bundeskriminalamt (or BKA), <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.stern.de/digital/computer/ueberwachung-techniker-statt-trojaner-3267584.html\">told a local magazine</a> that his agency was using computer spyware. Then in 2008, WikiLeaks <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Skype_and_the_Bavarian_trojan_in_the_middle\">revealed</a> the existence of DigiTask, a company that was selling spyware to German authorities for capturing Skype calls. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2011, hackers at the German Chaos Computer Club <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2011/staatstrojaner\">found a sample of spyware</a> on the computer of a businessman passing through Munich’s airport customs, which they attributed to German police. The hackers called the malware Bundestrojaner, which is German for “federal trojan.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, these were stories that received little public attention. A few years later, as security researchers started documenting the abuse of European-made spyware in countries like Egypt, Ethiopia, Mexico, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, and several more, spyware went mainstream, and is now a relatively normalized technology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some countries like Italy have legislation regulating the use of spyware, the European Union has since <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2024)766262\">attempted to set common standards</a> for the use of this type of technology in response to the scandals in the continent.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The tech giant announced on Thursday that it’s bringing “Personal Intelligence” to AI Mode, enabling it to tap into your Gmail and Google Photos to provide more individualized responses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/geminis-new-beta-feature-provides-proactive-responses-based-on-your-photos-emails-and-more/\">debuted Personal Intelligence</a> last week in the Gemini app to allow the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The opt-in feature is now starting to roll out to AI Mode to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in English in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing Personal Intelligence to Gemini and AI Mode, Google is leveraging the wealth of user data already within its ecosystem. Since users already rely on services like Gmail and Photos, Google can deliver more personalized experiences that rivals can’t easily match. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and emails, so you can turn Personal Intelligence on or off at any time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Personal Intelligence, recommendations don’t just match your interests — they fit seamlessly into your life,” Robby Stein, VP of Product, Google Search, explained in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/personal-intelligence-ai-mode-search/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “You don’t have to constantly explain your preferences or existing plans, it selects recommendations just for you, right from the start.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085026\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png 1532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=768,455 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=680,403 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=1200,711 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=1280,759 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=430,255 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=720,427 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=900,533 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=800,474 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=668,396 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=633,375 633w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=1041,617 1041w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=708,420 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-10.13.11-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Say you’re planning a vacation and searching for things to do and places to eat that everyone in your family will enjoy. With Personal Intelligence, AI Mode can draw on your hotel booking in Gmail and past travel memories in Google Photos to suggest a tailored itinerary with something for everyone. For example, you might see recommendations like an old-timey ice cream parlor based on the many ice cream selfies stored in Google Photos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google notes that AI Mode won’t just give you a generic list of restaurants and activities; it instead provides a personalized starting point for planning.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Personal Intelligence can also be particularly helpful for shopping, because AI Mode considers the types of items you buy and where you shop,” Stein wrote. “If you need a new coat for your upcoming trip, AI Mode could automatically take into account the brands you prefer, as well as your flight confirmation in Gmail to identify the destination and timing (Chicago in March). You’ll get suggestions for windproof, versatile coats that fit the weather and your preferred look. It’s like a personal shopper who already knows your itinerary and the vibe you’re going for.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says other questions you could ask are: “Make a scavenger hunt for [partner’s name] to celebrate our anniversary. For each location, include a hint about us,” or “I’m decorating [child’s name ]’s bedroom, give me ideas for a theme and suggestions for decor.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that AI Mode doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts and the model’s responses. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/27/trump-tiktok-decision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blocked</a> Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/senate-passes-a-bill-forcing-tiktok-to-face-a-ban-if-bytedance-doesnt-sell-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Senate</a> passed the bill against TikTok, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/24/will-congress-ban-tiktok/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">President Joe Biden</a> signed it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/tiktok-sues-the-us-government-over-law-seeking-to-ban-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TikTok sued the U.S. government</a>, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fast-forward to 2024: <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-656/336151/20241227163400981_2024-12-27%20-%20TikTok%20v.%20Garland%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20President%20Donald%20J.%20Trump.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trump</a> had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been several contenders, including <a href=\"https://www.thepeoplesbid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The People’s Bid for TikTok </a>, a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/billionaire-frank-mccourt-wants-to-buy-tiktok-heres-his-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Frank McCourt</a>.

Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\">Google acquired viral AI coding startup Windsurf’s CEO</a> and other top researchers, and OpenAI has acquired several startup teams in recent months, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/openai-to-acquire-the-team-behind-executive-coaching-ai-tool-convogo/\">Convogo</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/with-its-latest-acqui-hire-openai-is-doubling-down-on-personalized-consumer-ai/\">Roi</a>. The Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-16/us-is-scrutinizing-big-tech-talent-acquisitions-ftc-chief-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently said</a> that it would take a closer look at such deals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal also shows that voice is becoming the next frontier in AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hume AI’s secret sauce is its model’s ability to understand a user’s emotions and mood based on their voice. In 2024, the startup <a href=\"https://www.hume.ai/blog/series-b-evi-announcement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched its Empathetic Voice Interface</a>, a conversational AI with emotional intelligence. Hume AI has raised close to $80 million to date according to PitchBook, and expects to bring in $100 million in revenue this year, per Wired. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Hume AI isn’t the only company working on voice-focused models. Google has been steadily improving its Gemini Live feature, which allows a user to have conversations with the chatbot. Last month, Google released a new native audio model for the Live API that improved the model’s ability to “handle complex workflows,” per the <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/changelog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gemini API release notes</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in the industry are investing big into voice capabilities as well. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/openai-bets-big-on-audio-as-silicon-valley-declares-war-on-screens/\">OpenAI is reportedly</a> preparing to overhaul its audio models in preparation for its audio-first personal device, created with Jonny Ive’s io, to launch this year. Recent leaks suggest the device could be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openai-aims-to-ship-its-first-device-in-2026-and-it-could-be-earbuds/\">a form of earbuds</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Meta also accelerated its AI audio push by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/13/meta-acquires-voice-startup-play-ai/\">acquiring startup Play AI</a>. The Facebook-maker’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are increasingly relying on voice and audio capabilities for tasks like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/metas-ai-glasses-can-now-help-you-hear-conversations-better/\">helping you hear conversations in noisy rooms</a> and enabling hands-free control for calls, texts, music, and photos. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Voice is the only acceptable input mode for wearables,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/why-this-vc-thinks-2026-will-be-the-year-of-the-consumer/\">investor Vanessa Larco</a> told TechCrunch. “This acquisition will only accelerate the need for voice apps.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Demand continues to increase for voice capabilities. Earlier this month, ElevenLabs, the AI voice generation startup, said it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/elevenlabs-ceo-says-the-voice-ai-startup-crossed-330-million-arr-last-year/\">crossed $330 million</a> in annual recurring revenue. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Smith</a>, used artificial composite materials called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">metamaterials</a>” to make a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2005-12-david-smith-descartes-award-material.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">real-life invisibility cloak</a>. While this cloak didn’t really work like Harry Potter’s, exhibiting limited ability to conceal objects from the light of a single microwave length, those advances in material science did eventually trickle down to electromagnetism research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Austin-based <a href=\"https://www.neurophos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Neurophos</a>, a photonics startup spun out of Duke University and <a href=\"https://metaceptsystem.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Metacept</a> (an incubator run by Smith), is taking that research further to solve what may be the biggest problem facing AI labs and hyperscalers: how to scale computing power while keeping power consumption in check.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has come up with a “metasurface modulator” with optical properties that enable it to serve as a <a href=\"https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-core\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tensor core processor</a> for doing matrix vector multiplication — math that is at the heart of a lot of AI work (particularly inferencing), currently performed by specialized GPUs and TPUs that use traditional silicon gates and transistors. By fitting thousands of these modulators on a chip, Neurophos claims, its “optical processing unit” is significantly faster than the silicon GPUs currently used en masse at AI data centers, and far more efficient at inferencing (running trained models), which can be a fairly expensive task.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To fund the development of its chips, Neurophos has just raised $110 million in a Series A round led by Gates Frontier (Bill Gates’ venture firm), with participation from Microsoft’s M12, Carbon Direct, Aramco Ventures, Bosch Ventures, Tectonic Ventures, Space Capital, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/21/light-powered-ai-chips-future/\">photonic chips are nothing new</a>. In theory, photonic chips offer higher performance than traditional silicon because light produces less heat than electricity, it can travel faster, and is far less susceptible to changes in temperature and electromagnetic fields.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But optical components tend to be much larger than their silicon counterparts, and can be difficult to mass-produce. And they also need converters to transform data from digital to analog and back, which can be large and take up a lot of power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neurophos, however, posits that the metasurface it has developed can solve all of those problems in one swoop because it is about “10,000 times” smaller than traditional optical transistors. The small size, the startup claims, enables it to fit thousands of units on a chip, which results in far more efficiency than traditional silicon because the chip can do many more calculations at once.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you shrink the optical transistor, you can do way more math in the optics domain before you have to do that conversion back to the electronics domain,” Dr. Patrick Bowen, CEO and co-founder of Neurophos, told TechCrunch. “If you want to go fast, you have to solve the energy efficiency problem first. Because if you’re going to take a chip and make it 100 times faster, it burns 100 times more power. So you get the privilege of going fast after you solve the energy efficiency problem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result, Neurophos claims, is an optical processing unit that can wildly outperform Nvidia’s B200 AI GPU. The startup <a href=\"https://11549dc2-0dc9-4363-9a47-d257d2a497cc.filesusr.com/ugd/79aa3c_85cd1a5477d44f4fa0e423c03ad0746c.pdf?index=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">says</a> its chip can run at 56 GHz, yielding a peak 235 Peta Operations per Second (POPS) and consuming 675 watts, compared to the B200, which can deliver 9 POPS at 1,000 watts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bowen says Neurophos has already signed multiple customers (though he declined to name any), and companies including Microsoft are “looking very closely” at the startup’s products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the startup is entering a crowded market that’s dominated by Nvidia, the world’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/nvidia-becomes-first-public-company-worth-5-trillion/\">most valuable public company</a>, whose products have more or less underpinned the entire AI boom. There are also other companies working on photonics, though some, like Lightmatter, have <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/17/photonics-startup-lightmatter-details-p1-its-ai-optical-accelerator-chip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pivoted</a> to focusing on interconnects. And Neurophos is still a few years away from production, expecting its first chips to hit the market by mid-2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Bowen is confident the performance and efficiency advances provided by its metasurface modulators will prove a sufficient moat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What everyone else is doing is, and this includes Nvidia, in terms of the fundamental physics of the silicon, it’s really evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and it’s tied to the progress of TSMC. If you look at the improvement of TSMC nodes, on average, they improve in energy efficiency about 15%, and that takes a couple years,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Even if we chart out Nvidia’s improvement in architecture over the years, by the time we come out in 2028, we still have massive advantages over everyone else in the market because we’re starting with a 50x over Blackwell in both energy efficiency and raw speed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And to address the mass-manufacturing issues optical chips have traditionally faced, Neurophos says its chips can be made with standard silicon foundry materials, tools, and processes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh funding will be used for the development of the company’s first integrated photonic compute system, including data center-ready OPU modules, a full software stack, and early-access developer hardware. The company is also opening a San Francisco engineering site and expanding its HQ in Austin, Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Modern AI inference demands monumental amounts of power and compute,” Dr. Marc Tremblay, corporate vice president and technical fellow of core AI infrastructure at Microsoft, said in a statement. “We need a breakthrough in compute on par with the leaps we’ve seen in AI models themselves, which is what Neurophos’ technology and high-talent density team is developing.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But as AI coding tools have gotten better, the test has had to change a lot to stay ahead of AI-assisted cheating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Team lead Tristan Hume described the history of the challenge <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/AI-resistant-technical-evaluations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a blog post on Wednesday</a>. “Each new Claude model has forced us to redesign the test,” Hume writes. “When given the same time limit, Claude Opus 4 outperformed most human applicants. That still allowed us to distinguish the strongest candidates — but then, Claude Opus 4.5 matched even those.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is a serious candidate-assessment problem. Without in-person proctoring, there’s no way to ensure someone isn’t using AI to cheat on the test — and if they do, they’ll quickly rise to the top. “Under the constraints of the take-home test, we no longer had a way to distinguish between the output of our top candidates and our most capable model,” Hume writes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue of AI cheating is already <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/chatgpt-ai-cheating-college-blue-books-5e3014a6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wreaking havoc at schools and universities</a> around the world, so it’s ironic that AI labs are having to deal with it too. But Anthropic is also uniquely well-equipped to deal with the problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the end, Hume designed a new test that had less to do with optimizing hardware, making it sufficiently novel to stump contemporary AI tools. But as part of the post, he shared the original test to see if anyone reading could come up with a better solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you can best Opus 4.5,” the post reads, “we’d love to hear from you.”</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The rocket will instead carry a satellite to low-Earth orbit for AST SpaceMobile, marking the second time that Jeff Bezos’ space company has flown a commercial payload with New Glenn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company didn’t immediately explain why it chose to launch the AST SpaceMobile satellite instead of its own robotic lunar lander. The lander, known as Blue Moon Mark 1 (MK1), is currently being shipped to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Texas for <a href=\"https://x.com/blueorigin/status/2014043028445364229\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">vacuum chamber testing</a>. A launch date for that mission has not been set.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, this will be the third New Glenn launch in just over a year, after the rocket spent a decade in development. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch will come at a busy month for spaceflight: NASA may launch its Artemis II mission, in which four astronauts will orbit the moon, as early as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-artemis-ii-rocket-rolls-to-launch-pad-but-key-test-looms-ahead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">February 6</a>; SpaceX is expected to start testing the third version of its Starship rocket; and NASA and SpaceX will launch the Crew-12 mission, which will help bring the International Space Station back up to full staff after the Crew-11 team was <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/human-spaceflight/we-can-handle-any-kind-of-difficult-situation-crew-11-astronauts-say-1st-medical-evacuation-from-iss-had-a-silver-lining\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">medically evacuated earlier this month</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For this launch, Blue Origin will reuse the booster stage from New Glenn’s second mission, which happened last <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/blue-origin-sticks-first-new-glenn-rocket-landing-and-launches-nasa-spacecraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">November</a>. The company recovered that booster by landing it on a drone ship in the ocean, similar to what SpaceX has been doing with its Falcon 9 boosters for years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New Glenn is Blue Origin’s first vehicle meant to regularly deliver payloads to Earth orbit and beyond, and it builds on the suborbital rocket program called New Shepard that has been in operation for more than a decade. The company has signed a deal with AST SpaceMobile to send multiple satellites to orbit to help that company build out its space-based cellular broadband network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But New Glenn is just one piece of the company’s grander ambitions. In November, the company revealed a super-heavy variant of New Glenn that will be taller than a Saturn V rocket, on par with SpaceX’s Starship. And on Wednesday, the company announced a satellite internet constellation called TeraWave that it plans to start deploying in late 2027.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also hopes to use its Blue Moon landers on missions to the moon and Mars, and has been developing another spacecraft called Blue Ring that can host and deploy payloads for other space companies.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company, which is based in San Francisco and has an office in Pune, India, is targeting up to $35 million this year as it builds a royalty-driven on-device AI business. That growth has buoyed the company, which now has a post-money valuation of between $270 million and $300 million, up from around $100 million in its 2022 Series B, Kheterpal said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has also helped attract investors to the company. Quadric <a href=\"https://quadric.ai/press-release/quadric-raises-30m-series-c-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> last week a $30 million Series C round led by Accelerate Fund, managed by Beenext Capital Management, bringing its total funding to $72 million. The raise comes as investors and chipmakers look for ways to push more AI workloads from centralized cloud infrastructure onto devices and local servers, Kheterpal told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-automotive-to-everything\">From automotive to everything</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quadric <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/quadric-io-raises-15m-to-build-a-plug-and-play-supercomputer-for-autonomous-systems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">began in automotive</a>, where on-device AI can power real-time functions like driver assistance. Kheterpal said the spread of transformer-based models in 2023 pushed inference into “everything,” creating a sharp business inflection over the past 18 months as more companies try to run AI locally rather than rely on the cloud.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nvidia is a strong platform for data-center AI,” Kheterpal said. “We were looking to build a similar CUDA-like or programmable infrastructure for on-device AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike Nvidia, Quadric does not make chips itself. Instead, it licenses programmable AI processor IP, which Kheterpal described as a “blueprint” that customers can embed into their own silicon, along with a software stack and toolchain to run models, including vision and voice, on-device.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084789\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=768,373 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=680,330 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=1200,583 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=1280,622 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=430,209 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=720,350 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=900,437 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=800,389 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=1536,746 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=668,325 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=1270,617 1270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=708,344 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/quadric-chip-architecture.jpg?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Quadric’s tech is chip-agnostic and is driven by code.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Quadric</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s customers span printers, cars, and AI laptops, including Kyocera and Japan’s auto supplier Denso, which builds chips for Toyota vehicles. The first products based on Quadric’s technology are expected to ship this year, beginning with laptops, Kheterpal told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, Quadric is now looking beyond traditional commercial deployments and into markets exploring “sovereign AI” strategies to reduce reliance on U.S.-based infrastructure, Kheterpal said. The startup is exploring customers in India and Malaysia, he added, and counts Moglix CEO Rahul Garg as a strategic investor helping shape its India “sovereign” approach. Quadric employs nearly 70 people worldwide, including about 40 in the U.S. and around 10 in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push is being driven by the rising cost of centralized AI infrastructure and the difficulty many countries face in building hyperscale data centers, Kheterpal said, prompting more interest in “distributed AI” setups where inference runs on laptops or small on-premise servers inside offices rather than relying on cloud-based services for every query.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The World Economic Forum <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/power-connectivity-and-the-next-phase-of-the-ai-supercycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pointed</a> to this shift in a recent article, as AI inference moves closer to users and away from purely centralized architectures. Similarly, EY <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_in/insights/ai/agentic-ai-india/sovereign-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> in a November report that the sovereign AI approach has gained traction as policymakers and industry groups push for domestic AI capabilities spanning compute, models, and data, rather than relying entirely on foreign infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For chipmakers, the challenge is that AI models are evolving faster than hardware design cycles, Kheterpal said. He argued that customers need programmable processor IP that can keep pace through software updates rather than requiring costly redesigns every time architectures shift from earlier vision-focused models to today’s transformer-based systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quadric is pitching itself as an alternative to chip vendors such as Qualcomm, which typically uses its AI technology inside its own processors, as well as IP suppliers like Synopsys and Cadence, which sell neural processing engine blocks. Kheterpal said Qualcomm’s approach can lock customers into its own silicon, while traditional IP suppliers offer engine blocks that many customers find difficult to program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The programmable approach by Quadric allows customers to support new AI models through software updates rather than redesigning hardware, giving an advantage in an industry where chip development can take years, while <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/generative-ai-the-next-s-curve-for-the-semiconductor-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">model architectures shift in a matter of months</a> nowadays.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Quadric remains early in its buildout, with a handful of signed customers so far and much of its longer-term upside dependent on turning today’s licensing deals into high-volume shipments and recurring royalties.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Poojary later went on to work at Google and YouTube on shopping. Marchand, who is the CTO of Sparkli, was also one of the co-founders of Shoploop and later worked at Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When a kid asked what Mars looks like fifty years ago, we might have shown them a picture,” said Poojary. “Ten years ago, we might have shown them a video. With Sparkli, we want kids to interact and experience what Mars is like.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup said that education systems often fall behind in teaching modern concepts. Sparkli wants to teach kids about topics like skills design, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship by creating an AI-powered learning “expedition.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app lets users explore some predefined topics in different categories or ask their own questions to create a learning path. The app also highlights one new topic every day to let kids learn something new. Kids can either listen to the generated voice or read the text. Chapters under one topic include a mix of audio, video, images, quizzes, and games. The app also creates choose-as-you-go adventures that don’t create the pressure of getting questions right or wrong.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084427\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg 2763w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=1200,857 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=1280,914 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=430,307 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=720,514 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=900,643 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=800,572 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=1536,1097 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=2048,1463 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=668,477 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=525,375 525w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=864,617 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=708,506 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sparkli</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poojary mentioned that the startup uses generative AI to create all of its media assets on the fly. The company can create a learning experience within two minutes of a user asking a question, and it is trying to reduce this time further. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup mentioned that while AI assistants can help children learn certain topics, their focus is not on education. It said that to make its product effective, the first two hires were a PhD holder in educational science and AI and a teacher. This was a conscious decision to ensure its content better serves children, keeping principles of pedagogy in mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the key concerns around kids using AI is safety. Companies like OpenAI and Character.ai are facing lawsuits from parents who allege that these tools encouraged their children to self-harm. Sparkli said that while certain topics like sexual content are completely banned on the app, when a child asks about topics like self-harm, the app tries to teach them about emotional intelligence and encourages them to talk to their parents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is piloting its app with an institute that has a network of schools with over 100,000 students. Currently, its target audience is children aged 5-12, and it tested its product in over 20 schools last year.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sparkli - Hello World!\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5i6lPL0yOA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sparkli has also built a teacher module that allows teachers to track progress and assign homework to kids. The company said that it was inspired by Duolingo to make the app engaging enough that kids can learn concepts and also feel like coming back to the app frequently. The app has streaks and rewards for kids for completing lessons regularly. It also gives kids quest cards, based on the initial avatar they have set up, for learning different topics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have seen a very positive response from our school pilots. Teachers often use Sparkli to create expeditions that kids can explore at the start of the class and lead them into a more discussion-based format. Some teachers also used it to create [homework] after they explain a topic to let kids explore further and get a measure of their understanding,” Poojary said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the startup wants to primarily work with schools globally for the next few months, it wants to open up consumer access and let parents download the app by mid-2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised $5 million in pre-seed funding led by Swiss venture firm Founderful. Sparkli is Founderful’s first pure-play edtech investment. The firm’s founding partner, Lukas Weder, said that the team’s technical skill and market opportunity nudged him to invest in the startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a father of two kids who are in school now, I see them learning interesting stuff, but they don’t learn topics like financial literacy or innovation in technology. I thought from a product point of view, Sparkli gets them away from video games and lets them learn stuff in an immersive way,” Weder said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The device will be a pin that users can wear on their clothing, and that comes equipped with two cameras and three microphones, the report says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Should the rumored device come to market, it would mark another sign that the AI hardware market is heating up. This news follows comments made Monday by OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane, who <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/openai-device-2026-lehane-jony-ive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told a Davos crowd</a> that his company will likely announce its highly anticipated first AI hardware device in the second half of this year. Additional reporting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openai-aims-to-ship-its-first-device-in-2026-and-it-could-be-earbuds/\">suggests that </a>the device may be a pair of earbuds.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s device is described as a “thin, flat, circular disc with an aluminum-and-glass shell,” which engineers hope to make the same size as an AirTag, “only slightly thicker.” The pin will also have two cameras (one with a standard lens and another with a wide-angle) for pictures and video, as well as a physical button, a speaker, and a Fitbit-like charging strip on its back, according to the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple may even be in the process of trying to accelerate development of this product to compete with OpenAI’s. The pin could potentially be released in 2027 and involve 20 million units at launch, the report notes. TechCrunch reached out to Apple for more information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it remains to be seen if consumers want this kind of AI device. Two Apple alums previously <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/08/humane-the-secretive-ai-startup-founded-by-ex-apple-employees-raises-another-100m/\">founded Humane AI</a>, a startup which also sold an AI pin.

Sheng was previously a research scientist at Databricks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RadixArk’s Ying Sheng, Accel, and Lip-Bu Tan did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both SGLang and RadixArk focus on optimizing inference processing — essentially allowing models to run faster and more efficiently on the same hardware. Together with model training, inference represents a large portion of the server costs associated with AI services. As a result, tools that optimize the process can create enormous savings almost immediately.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RadixArk isn’t alone in making this transition from open source project to well-funded startup. vLLM, a more mature project for optimizing inference, has also made the leap. The newly formed company has had conversations about raising upwards of $160 million in funding at a valuation of about $1 billion, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2025/12/22/open-source-project-with-little-revenue-in-talks-to-raise-at-least-160-million/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Forbes reported</a> last month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three people familiar with that deal tell TechCrunch that Andreessen Horowitz is leading the investment into vLLM, though the final numbers of that investment remain to be seen. Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment. vLLM co-founder Simon Mo characterized the information about this round “factually inaccurate” in a statement to TechCrunch, though he declined to specify which details were incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like SGLang, vLLM was incubated in Ion Stoica’s lab at UC Berkeley. Stoica, a professor at UC Berkeley, is the famed co-founder of Databricks as well as a number of other startups.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several large tech companies already run their inference workloads using vLLM, and SGLang has also gained significant popularity over the last six months, Brittany Walker, a general partner at CRV, told TechCrunch. Her firm did not back either company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RadixArk is continuing to develop SGLang as an open source AI model engine. The startup is also building Miles, a specialized framework designed for reinforcement learning, which allows businesses to train AI models to become smarter over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While most of its tools remain free, RadixArk has started charging fees for hosting services, a person familiar with the company told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups providing inference infrastructure for developers have seen a surge in funding in recent months, underscoring the continued importance of the inference layer for AI. Baseten recently secured $300 million at a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidia-invests-150-million-in-ai-inference-startup-baseten-fe7ede72?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfUxvEIEbv9qPC6QC-lDBdl1ePwQZa38vlQRdu7-uEdVUdBr1VzoUOX_aGSa3M%3D&amp;gaa_ts=696ff315&amp;gaa_sig=aTqOyemxk0sZczLbn_MrQZg72McPqqqpkBw4Wlb2YeT_5S446IbaLIqOrsgOKsA3HuXGStvO0YpOenBY0f8tqQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$5 billion valuation</a>, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.

The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime, companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-last-minute-reversal\">A last-minute reversal</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>May 7:</strong> Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration planned on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/07/ai-rule-trump-biden-nvidia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/trump-to-rescind-global-chip-curbs-amid-ai-restrictions-debate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>, the administration wouldn’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-april\">April</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions\">Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>April 30: </strong>Anthropic <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/anthropic-suggests-tweaks-to-proposed-u-s-ai-chip-export-controls/\">doubled down on its support</a> for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/nvidia-takes-aim-at-anthropics-support-of-chip-export-controls/\">An Nvidia spokesperson shot back</a>, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’” </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-planned-layoffs-at-intel\">Planned layoffs at Intel</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>April 22: </strong>Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/intel-reportedly-plans-to-lay-off-over-21000-employees/\">21,000 employees</a>. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports\">The Trump administration further restricts chip exports</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>April 15: </strong>Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-h20-chip-exports-hit-with-license-requirement-by-us-government/\">licensing requirement</a>, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added that it expected $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 was the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports\">Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>April 9: </strong>Nvidia’s CEO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/nvidias-h20-ai-chips-may-be-spared-from-export-controls-for-now/\">Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago</a> resort, according to reports.
