            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is expanding its footprint in India and moving into the country’s higher-education system through partnerships with leading academic institutions. The move comes as the South Asian nation seeks to scale AI skills and build domestic capacity in one of the world’s largest talent markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, OpenAI said it was partnering with six public and private higher-education institutions in India, including top engineering, management, medical, and design-focused institutes, with the aim of reaching more than 100,000 students, faculty, and staff over the next year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than focusing on consumer use, the initiative centers on integrating AI into core academic functions, signalling OpenAI’s interest in influencing how AI is taught, governed, and normalized within one of the world’s largest higher-education systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has already built a large consumer audience for its ChatGPT chatbot, which has over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">100 million monthly active users</a> in India, according to CEO Sam Altman, and India has emerged as the company’s second-largest user base after the U.S. The announcement also coincides with a broader push by leading AI firms to deepen their presence in India, which is hosting an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first cohort of partners includes some of India’s most influential academic institutions, such as the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, alongside private universities and specialised design schools. The ChatGPT maker said the partnerships would span disciplines ranging from engineering and management to healthcare and creative fields.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has already emerged as a key testing ground for AI use in education. Last month, Google said India accounts for the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/india-is-teaching-google-how-ai-in-education-can-scale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">highest global usage of its Gemini tools for learning</a>. Microsoft, similarly, said this week it would <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/02/17/acting-with-urgency-to-address-the-growing-ai-divide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expand its Elevate skilling program</a> in India to train teachers across schools, vocational institutes, and higher-education settings, working with government agencies as part of a broader push to build AI skills at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said the partnerships would involve campus-wide access to its ChatGPT Edu tools, faculty training, and responsible-use frameworks. The focus, the company said, is on embedding AI into core academic workflows such as coding, research, analytics, and case analysis, rather than offering standalone access to tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two of the partner institutions, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, will also introduce OpenAI-backed certifications. Additionally, OpenAI said it would work with Indian ed-tech platforms, including PhysicsWallah, upGrad, and HCL GUVI, to extend AI training beyond campuses. These platforms will launch structured courses on AI fundamentals and ChatGPT use cases, aimed at students and early-career professionals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Raghav Gupta, head of education at OpenAI India, said educational institutions were a “critical route” to closing the gap between rapidly advancing AI tools and how people are actually using them, as skills demands shift across the economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, OpenAI hired Gupta, a former Coursera Asia-Pacific managing director, as its India and Asia-Pacific head of education, alongside the launch of a Learning Accelerator programme focused on expanding AI skills.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flurry of moves into education underscores how AI companies are increasingly looking beyond consumer tools and corporate clients toward institutions that shape skills, norms, and long-term adoption. For countries like India, the contest is not just around access to AI, but also about who helps define how it is taught, governed, and embedded at scale.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That user base helped push its annual recurring revenue to $4 billion by the end of year, Canva co-founder and COO Cliff Obrecht told TechCrunch on the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar. The subscription-based company also saw its B2B business, which accounts for companies with more than 25 seats, grow by 100% with $500 million in ARR. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company still sees the majority of its business from North America, with continued growth in international markets. To increase paying users, Canva has introduced lower-priced subscriptions in countries like Pakistan, Uruguay, Morocco, and Jamaica.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canva’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/07/canva-wants-you-to-pay-a-lot-more-for-its-ai-features/\">AI investments</a> are paying off, according to Obrecht. The company debuted a tool that lets users create <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/canva-is-adding-an-ai-assistant-coding-and-sheets-to-its-platform/\">mini apps and websites using AI last year</a>. Obrecht noted the tool has more than 10 million monthly active users now. It’s been successful enough that the company is thinking about putting AI at the center and acting like a “design agency in your pocket,” Obrecht said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That shift to AI comes as Canva faces competition from the likes of Adobe, Freepik, and Apple, which has pushed to become a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/apple-launches-creator-studio-bundle-of-apps-for-12-99-per-month/\">full-packaged creator suite</a> by bundling apps like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStagewith into a $12.99 per month Creator Studio. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where we started was… we got the Canva platform, and we’re giving the Canva platform a bunch of AI tools. We’re inverting that now. We’re becoming an AI platform with a bunch of design tools. So you can think of it more like a cursor for design,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canva is also actively integrating with chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude. It said that by October 2025, users had more than 26 million conversations with the Canva app on ChatGPT. It also claimed that Canva was one of the top 10 referred domains from ChatGPT.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obrecht said that the company is allocating resources to work on having Canva surface in LLM search results, along with working on SEO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So we drove a lot of early days in Canva through Google, really understood people’s search intent, and delivered them content that they could then go into our product and edit. And so we really see ChatGPT or any of the LLMs top of the funnel acquisition platforms,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He noted that while search is a big driving factor, traffic through LLM referrals is in double-digit percentages. The company is also allocating resources to have Canva surface more in chatbots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canva was last valued at $42 billion in a share sell. Obrecht told <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-21/canva-s-obrecht-says-firm-eyeing-ipo-in-next-couple-of-years\">Bloomberg</a> last November, that the company will go public in the next “couple of years.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The partnership will see the two companies collaborating to explore how World Labs’ models  — AI systems that can generate and reason about immersive 3D environments — can work alongside Autodesk’s tools, and vice versa, starting with a focus on entertainment use cases. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is part of a larger round for World Labs, according to Autodesk, which declined to disclose further details. World Labs, which emerged from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-comes-out-of-stealth-with-230m-in-funding/\">stealth in 2024 with $230 million</a> at a $1 billion valuation, is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/fei-fei-li-s-ai-startup-world-labs-in-funding-talks-at-5-billion-valuation\">reportedly</a> now in talks to raise capital at a $5 billion valuation. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">World Labs did not immediately return a request for more details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For World Labs, Autodesk’s investment is a signal that its product has commercial appeal. The startup’s first world model product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\">Marble</a>, released last November, lets users create editable, downloadable 3D environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk is one of the biggest developers of 3D CAD (computer-aided design) software. Its platform underpins architectural, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and entertainment workflows. That focus on the built world makes investment in advanced spatial AI a natural extension of its core business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or as Li put it in a statement: “Autodesk has long helped people think spatially and solve real-world problems and, together, we share a clear purpose: building physical AI that augments human creativity and puts more powerful tools in the hands of designers, builders, and creators.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, Autodesk will serve as an advisor to World Labs, and the two will collaborate at the “research and model level.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daron Green, Autodesk’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch the partnership is still in its early days, so the precise form it’s going to take hasn’t been determined yet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You could anticipate us consuming their models or them consuming our models in different settings,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He mused that customers might like to start with a world-model-based sketch in World Labs (say, of an office layout) and then drill down on certain design aspects (like the design of the desk), which is where Autodesk’s tech might come in. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Similarly, you might want to take an object that you’ve designed in our [platform], and put it in a context that you create through one of [World Labs’s] prompts,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green added that data sharing is not part of the agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green said the two companies plan to start with media and entertainment use cases. Most companies building world models — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/i-built-marshmallow-castles-in-googles-new-ai-world-generator-project-genie/\">Google DeepMind</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/\">Runway</a> — see gaming and interactive entertainment as an initial go-to-market strategy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk already works with most major media production companies and has been training models for character animation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are close to world models,” Green said. “They’re a characterization of an animal in the world that’s responding to physical constraints like time, maybe a terrain it needs to traverse. So there’s a physical understanding in the model, and you can see how that might be combined [with World Labs’s tech]. You’re not just animating the dog, but you’re giving it a world within which it can now interact.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership with World Labs supports Autodesk’s broader push to integrate more AI features across its software portfolio. The company is developing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/news/upcoming-3d-generative-ai-foundation-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">“neural CAD,”</a> a new kind of generative AI model trained on geometric data that can reason about components and entire systems. Put simply, it can generate working 3D models, not just images, with an understanding of how those designs would function in the real world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk’s neural CAD models are already being integrated into the firm’s product design and architecture products as a step toward more advanced spatial intelligence. But World Labs’ models could help extend that capability beyond individual design files toward more holistic digital representations of the physical world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green thinks different AI systems, including large language models, world models and neural CAD, will be combined in the future to improve designs for Autodesk’s customers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If AI is to be truly useful, it must understand worlds, not just words,” Li said in the statement. “Worlds are governed by geometry, physics, and dynamics, and reconciling the semantic, spatial, and physical is the next great frontier of AI.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A video demo showed a user clicking a dedicated AI button on a feature phone to converse with an AI assistant in a local language to get guidance on government schemes or local markets. It is not clear if all the AI features showcased at the event will work offline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Through edge AI, we want to bring intelligence to every phone, laptop, car, and even a new generation of devices,” Tushar Goswamy, head of Edge AI at Sarvam, said during a presentation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said that the company has worked with Qualcomm to tune its models for the latter’s chipsets. Sarvam didn’t provide details on which devices the models will be deployed to. Qualcomm said that it is developing a “Sovereign AI Experience Suite” that would work across a range of devices, including phones, PCs, laptops, cars, and IoT devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies can accelerate how we take sovereign AI from research to deployment,” Sarvam co-founder and CEO Vivek Raghwan said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This will allow Sarvam to design models and applications that run closer to the edge, safeguard data, and are ready for adoption, at scale.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarvam also said it is working with German engineering giant Bosch to bring AI assistants to cars, though it didn’t disclose many other details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also showed off a pair of AI smart-glasses, dubbed Sarvam Kaze, designed and manufactured in India.

Baglino said <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heronpower.com/\">Heron Power</a> didn’t need the money, but after customers expressed interest in buying more than 40 gigawatts of solid-state transformers, it decided to raise again. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If our customers are leaning in, we need to lean in as well,” Baglino, who is CEO of Heron Power, told TechCrunch. “We gotta go faster.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The speed at which Heron Power is raising shows just how data centers are driving demand for products that can rapidly deliver electricity to their servers. Baglino, who spent nearly two decades at Tesla and led the powertrain and energy groups, is no stranger to moving quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series B round was led by Andreessen Horowitz’s American Dynamism Fund and Breakthrough Energy Ventures with participation from Capricorn Investment Group, Energy Impact Partners, Gigascale Capital, and Valor Atreides AI Fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solid-state transformers have been under development more than a decade, but only recently have matured to the point where they are ready to deploy in data centers and other large, energy-intensive facilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new technology seeks to replace old iron-core transformers, which have existed in essentially the same form for more than a century. Iron-core transformers are inexpensive and efficient, but they are bulky and generate lots of heat. Solid-state transformers are smaller and can also more efficient by replacing several pieces of equipment, solving two of data center developers’ biggest challenges. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solid-state transformers can also manage power intelligently, including from a range of electricity sources like wind, solar, and batteries, because they use semiconductors instead of passive metal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s solid-state transformers, branded as Heron Link, can convert medium voltage electricity to the 800-volt power needed by Nvidia’s reference rack designs. They’re capable of handling 5 megawatts a piece, and each device contains tens of modules that do the power conversion. If one fails, it can be swapped out in about 10 minutes, far faster than it takes to replace a monolithic transformer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each Heron Link also contains specialized lithium-ion batteries that can discharge quickly to provide 30 seconds of power to smooth the transition to backup power sources like grid-scale batteries, allowing data centers to eliminate uninterruptible power supplies. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By eliminating pieces of equipment, solid-state transformers also eliminate several points of failure and reduce costs. “We can remove 70% of the gear involved,” Baglino said. “For some data center applications, it might be savings of an order of magnitude.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers are only about a third of Heron Power’s business currently, Baglino said. The remainder is split between solar power and grid-scale batteries, which benefit from solid-state transformers’ speed and flexibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heron Power plans to use the new funding to build a factory capable of producing 40-gigawatts of Heron Link transformers annually. That’s about 10% to 15% of annual production outside of China (or about 5% to 10% of total global demand), the equivalent to half the peak power demand of the state of Texas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Baglino said the company intends to begin pilot production in early 2027 before ramping production over the following two years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heron Power isn’t alone in developing solid-state transformers, and with many of the grid’s old transformers approaching replacement age, competition will be stiff. The startup’s new cash haul paired with Baglino’s experience scaling production could give it an advantage. “We will push as hard as we can,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These mark a sharp upgrade from the company’s 2-billion-parameter Sarvam 1 model that it released in October 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 30-billion- and 105-billion-parameter models use a mixture-of-experts architecture, which activates only a fraction of their total parameters at a time, significantly reducing computing costs, Sarvam said. The 30B model supports a 32,000-token context window aimed at real-time conversational use, while the larger model offers a 128,000-token window for more complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3093891\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Sarvam’s 30B model is placed against Google’s Gemma 27B and OpenAI’s GPT-OSS-20B, among other models </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sarvam</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarvam said the new AI models were trained from scratch rather than fine-tuned on existing open-source systems.

Engine Ventures led the round with ABB, Cerberus Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures, Clean Energy Ventures, Fine Structure Ventures, Helios Climate Ventures, MCJ, and Piedmont Capital participating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also recently announced a deal to provide its Interport device to Exowatt, the startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/sam-atlman-backed-exowatt-wants-to-power-ai-data-centers-with-billions-of-hot-rocks/\">building solar-plus-storage containers</a> to supply data centers with 24/7 electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Interport device acts as a router for power, Subhashish Bhattacharya, co-founder and CTO of DG Matrix, told TechCrunch. One Interport can handle up to 2.4 megawatts of connections. For example, it could accumulate 600 kilowatts from solar panels and 600 kilowatts from grid-scale batteries to feed power to 12 racks drawing 100 kilowatts each.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because Interport can integrate electricity from a variety of sources, including large batteries, DG Matrix says it can eliminate uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and the equipment needed to support them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altogether, one Interport can cut down the amount of space devoted to power conversion in a data center. Two four-by-30 foot skids laden with power conversion equipment can be replaced by a single four-by-four foot Interport device, DG Matrix co-founder and CEO Haroon Inam told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By eliminating several devices, the company can boost the system’s overall efficiency. All the legacy devices chained together can achieve about 82% to 90% efficiency, Inam said, while Interport is 95% to 98% efficient. He said that reliability should improve, too. “When you are using only 10%, 15% of the components that legacy is using, you’re going to be far more reliable,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DG Matrix is in the process of rolling out initial units to customers in June. Its next product will be a sidecar to supply data center racks with power that builds on the technology the company has already developed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, data centers represent about about 90% of DG Matrix’s pipeline, with the remainder devoted to EV charging for fleets. Inam said the next step is to expand into building power and add more capacity to build micro- and mini-grids to support electrification projects in remote communities. There, Interports would orchestrate power from solar, wind, and batteries to provide round-the-clock electricity without a grid connection.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody’s going to build a $100 million transmission line to a village,” Inam said. “Now you can spend a fraction of that money and help eliminate energy poverty.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Users could use that feature to insert digital likenesses of themselves into AI-generated videos. In a ruling filed Saturday, the court said the name was similar enough to cause user confusion, and rejected OpenAI’s argument that “Cameo” was merely descriptive, finding that “it suggests rather than describes the feature.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/openai-learned-the-hard-way-that-cameo-trademarked-the-word-cameo/\">the court granted a temporary restraining order to Cameo</a> and stopped OpenAI from using the word. The AI company then <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12435986-generating-content-with-characters\">renamed the feature to “Characters”</a> after that order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have spent nearly a decade building a brand that stands for talent-friendly interactions and genuine connection, and we like to say that ‘every Cameo is a commercial for the next one.” Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This ruling is a critical victory not just for our company, but for the integrity of our marketplace and the thousands of creators who trust the Cameo name. We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property against any platform that attempts to trade on the goodwill and recognition we have worked so hard to establish,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We disagree with the complaint’s assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word ‘cameo,’ and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” an OpenAI spokesperson told <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-blocked-using-cameo-name-amid-trademark-lawsuit-2026-02-17/\">Reuters</a> in response to the ruling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has been involved in several intellectual property cases in recent months. Earlier this month, the company ditched “IO” branding around its upcoming hardware products, according to court documents obtained by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-drops-io-branding-hardware-devices/\">WIRED</a>.

California is Tesla’s biggest U.S. market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November 2023, the DMV filed accusations that Tesla violated state law by using deceptive marketing of Autopilot, its basic advanced driver assistance system, as well as its more capable Full Self-Driving driver assistance software. The state regulator argued that the terms mislead customers and distorted the capabilities of the advanced driver assistance systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla stopped using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability,” and instead used Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to more accurately describe the system and clarify that drivers were still required to monitor it. But Tesla held on to the Autopilot term, prompting the DMV to refer the case to an administrative law judge at the California Office of Administrative Hearings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, the administrative law judge agreed with the DMV’s request to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its actions. The DMV agreed with the ruling, but didn’t pounce; instead, the state regulator gave Tesla 60 days to comply.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Since then, Tesla took corrective action and has stopped using the misleading term ‘Autopilot’ in the marketing of its electric vehicles in California,” the DMV stated in a release posted on its website. “Tesla had previously modified its use of the term ‘Full Self-Driving’ to clarify that driver supervision is required. By taking this prescribed action, Tesla will avoid having its dealer and manufacturer licenses suspended in the state for 30 days by the DMV.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla didn’t just stop using the term Autopilot, though. In January, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tesla-discontinues-autopilot-in-bid-to-boost-adoption-of-its-full-self-driving-software/\">discontinued Autopilot </a>in the U.S. and Canada altogether. The move not only helped it comply with the DMV but was also viewed as a way to boost adoption of FSD, which unlike Autopilot, requires the owner to pay for the upgraded system.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FSD Supervised, which until February 14 required an $8,000 one-time fee, is now only available through a monthly subscription of $99.

Amnesty said that Intellexa used infection servers that had been previously linked to the company’s spyware infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several hours after clicking on the link that led to his phone hack, Cândido rebooted his phone, which wiped the spyware from his device. Amnesty said it wasn’t clear how the spyware was capable of hacking Cândido’s phone, as his phone was running an outdated version of iOS at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers found that Predator stayed hidden by impersonating legitimate iOS system processes to avoid detection. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amnesty believes Cândido may be just one of many targets in the country, based on their findings that they were able to find multiple domains linked to the spyware maker used in Angola. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The first domains linked to Angola were deployed as early as March 2023, indicating the start of Predator testing or deployment in the country,” wrote the Amnesty researchers, who added that they had no evidence to determine exactly who hacked Cândido. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is not currently possible to conclusively identify the customer of the Predator spyware in the country,” read the report. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, based on leaks of internal documents, Amnesty and media organizations revealed that Intellexa employees <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/sanctioned-spyware-maker-intellexa-had-direct-access-to-government-espionage-victims-researchers-say/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">had the ability to access customers’ systems remotely</a>, potentially giving the spyware maker visibility into government surveillance operations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those leaks, like this report, shows that despite its controversies and sanctions, Intellexa has remained active in recent years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve now seen confirmed abuses in Angola, Egypt, Pakistan, Greece, and beyond — and for every case we uncover, many more abuses surely remain hidden,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, the head of the security lab at Amnesty International.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A combination of 3D-printed Lego-like parts, Formula 1 thinking, and a bounty program will help the company hit that target, Ford said Tuesday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It will have to. Ford took a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/fords-next-f-150-lightning-will-have-a-gas-generator-as-it-pivots-away-from-large-evs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$19.5 billion hit</a> in December and ended production of its battery-electric F-150 Lightning. It can’t afford for this new EV business strategy to fall flat. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford’s bet on a line of affordable EVs began several years ago with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/ex-tesla-exec-leading-ford-skunkworks-project-to-develop-low-cost-ev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">skunkworks team</a> led by Alan Clarke, a 12-year Tesla veteran. Pieces of its plan were revealed last August, when Ford said it would ditch its traditional moving assembly line and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/ford-throws-out-henry-fords-assembly-line-to-make-low-cost-evs-in-america/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invest $2 billion</a> in its Louisville factory to adopt a new production system that promises to speed up manufacturing by 15%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said at the time that its line of EVs would be built on a universal platform with single-piece aluminum unicastings — large components cast as one piece to eliminate parts and allow for faster assembly — and lithium iron phosphate batteries with tech licensed from China’s CATL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now Ford is sharing more specifics in a <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">flurry of blog and social media posts</a> on how it will fulfill its promise of a desirable EV truck that will be $20,000 cheaper than the average new vehicle while still generating profits. Ford didn’t share specs like the range, features, or charging times of this future EV. But it did reveal how it plans to build lighter, cheaper, more efficient EVs made with fewer parts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It all starts with the universal EV platform, or UEV. The platform will underpin a midsized truck first, then could support a sedan, crossover, three-row SUV, and even small commercial vans, according to Clarke. The UEV is Ford’s first “clean sheet” EV built from the ground up — a strategic shift for the company, which built its Mustang Mach-E and the Lightning EVs using existing infrastructure and manufacturing practices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a platform that is built around efficiency,” Clarke said in a briefing with the media. “It’s built around affordability to be able to make long-range electric vehicle travel affordable to more people.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To achieve that, Clarke set out to create a new culture seeded by talent from Formula 1 and companies like Apple, Lucid Motors, Rivian, and Tesla, as well as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/01/ford-snaps-up-ev-power-startup-to-boost-its-charging-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Auto Motive Power</a>, a startup acquired by Ford in 2023. The team, which includes about 450 people at its base in Long Beach, California, and 200 people in an office in Palo Alto, also adopted a bounty program to help engineers understand how their day-to-day decisions impact the customer and the end product, Clarke said in an interview with reporters. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The focus of the bounty program was efficiency. Numerical metrics were assigned to every aspect of the UEV, including vehicle mass, aerodynamic drag, and even specific vehicle parts. In practice, this meant Ford might decide to use a more expensive part if it helped decrease the weight of the EV, thereby making it more efficient and cost-effective. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve been very focused on making sure that the cost that we’re moving from the product doesn’t remove value,” Clarke said. One example is that even the base trim of the EV truck will have a power-folding mirror, a premium feature on most vehicles, because it decreases aerodynamic drag, according to Clarke. The company saved money by using one motor, instead of two, to handle the mirror adjustment and the folding. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3093747\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/UEV_mid-size_electricaero_mirror.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ford</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That obsession with efficiency included a team of ex-Formula 1 engineers who worked closely with Ford’s design team. The result, according to Ford, is a midsized EV truck that is 15% more aerodynamically efficient than any other pickup truck on the market today. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This team of former F1 engineers used 3D-printed and machined parts to create a Lego-like build for its test vehicle. Thousands of 3D-printed components, which are accurate within fractions of a millimeter of Ford’s simulations and could be swapped out in minutes, were used to measure aerodynamics. These Lego-like prototypes were used in wind tunnel testing early on — and often — to measure aerodynamics, a process that Ford traditionally used only when the design of a vehicle was nearly complete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A natural place to focus was on the battery, which can account for about 40% of a vehicle’s total expense. A lighter, more efficient vehicle allows Ford to use a smaller battery, which reduces cost. The end result, according to Clarke, will be an EV truck with about 15% more range, or 50 miles, than an equivalent pickup powered by gas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The efficiency push also led the team to adopt manufacturing tactics adopted and popularized by Tesla, including the use of aluminum unicastings and moving from a 12-volt system to a 48-volt power system that will be used for some vehicle functions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford also upended the electric vehicle architecture of the UEV, taking a zonal approach similar to Tesla and Rivian. Instead of scattering dozens of electronic control units (ECUs), or computers, throughout the vehicle, Ford has integrated multiple vehicle functions into five main modules. This reduces complexity, cost, and copper usage and helped make the EV truck’s wire harness 4,000 feet shorter and 22 pounds lighter than one of its first-generation electric vehicles, according to Luccas Di Tullio, a software engineer at Ford who previously worked at Auto Motive Power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Di Tullio said the company carried the same philosophy to the power electronic components, finding ways to share components and reduce parts with a single module that manages power distribution and battery management and provides AC power back to a customer’s home during an outage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford also developed its own software for those five main ECUs, down to the application layer, according to Clarke. Because Ford owns the software — to the lowest level — it becomes very portable, Clarke said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Other than being able to control the infotainment, what shows up on the screens, [and] how you interact with the vehicle, all of the body controls then are directly coupled,” he said. “So you can imagine that many of the experiences that can only be created by coupling all the different sensors around the vehicle are now at our fingertips and under our own control.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The plaintiff in the lawsuit is identified by her initials “KGM” or her first name, “Kaley.” She, along with her mother and others joining the case, is accusing social media companies of creating “addictive and dangerous” products that led the young users to suffer anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case is now one of several landmark trials that will take place this year, which accuse social media companies of harming children. The results of these lawsuits will impact these companies’ approach to their younger users and could prompt regulators to take further action. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this case, the plaintiff sued Meta, YouTube, ByteDance (TikTok), and Snap, but the latter two companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/snap-reaches-settlement-in-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">had</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/tiktok-joins-snap-to-settle-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">settled</a> their claims before the trial’s start.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the jury trial now underway in LA, Kaley’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, brought up an internal study at Meta, which he said found evidence that Meta knew of, yet didn’t publicize, these specific harms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Project MYST, which stands for the Meta and Youth Social Emotional Trends survey, Meta’s research concluded that “parental and household factors have little association with teens’ reported levels of attentiveness to their social media use.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or, in other words, even when parents try to control their children’s social media use, either by using parental controls or even just household rules and supervision, it doesn’t impact whether or not the child will overuse social media or use it compulsively. The study was based on a survey of 1,000 teens and their parents about their social media use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The study also noted that both parents and teens agreed on this front, saying “there is no association between either parental reports or teen reports of parental supervision, and teens’ survey measures of attentiveness or capability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the study’s findings are accurate, that would mean that the use of things like the built-in parental controls in the Instagram app or the time limits on smartphones wouldn’t necessarily help teens become less inclined to overuse social media, the plaintiff’s lawyer argued. As the original complaint alleges, teens are being exploited by social media products, whose defects include algorithmic feeds designed to keep users scrolling, intermittent variable rewards that manipulate dopamine delivery, incessant notifications, deficient tools for parental controls, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his testimony, Instagram head Adam Mosseri claimed not to be familiar with Meta’s Project MYST, even though a document seemed to indicate he had given his approval to move forward with the study.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do a lot of research projects,” Mosseri said, after claiming he couldn’t remember anything specific about MYST beyond its name. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the plaintiff’s lawyer pointed to this study as an example of why social media companies should be held accountable for their alleged harms, not the parents. He noted that Kaley’s mother, for example, had tried to stop her daughter’s social media addiction and use, even taking her phone away at times. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, the study found that teens who had a greater number of adverse life experiences — like those dealing with alcoholic parents, harassment at school, or other issues — reported less attentiveness over their social media use. That means that kids facing trauma in their real lives were more at risk of addiction, the lawyer argued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the stand, Mosseri seemed to partially agree with this finding, saying, “There’s a variety of reasons this can be the case. One I’ve heard often is that people use Instagram as a way to escape from a more difficult reality.” Meta is careful not to label any sort of overuse as addiction; instead, Mosseri stated that the company uses the term “problematic use” to refer to someone “spending more time on Instagram than they feel good about.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for Meta, meanwhile, pushed the idea that the study was more narrowly focused on understanding if teens felt they were using social media too much, not whether or not they were actually addicted. They also generally aimed to put more of the responsibility on parents and the realities of life as the catalyst for kids like Kaley’s negative emotional states, not companies’ social media products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/09/tech/instagram-youtube-social-media-trial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Meta’s lawyers pointed to</a> Kaley being a child of divorced parents, with an abusive father, and facing bullying at school.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How the jury will interpret the findings of studies like <a href=\"https://techoversight.org/2026/02/13/adam-mosseri-ig-testimony/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Project MYST and others</a>, along with the testimonies from both sides, remains to be seen. Mosseri did note, however, that MYST’s findings had not been published publicly, and no warnings were ever issued to teens or parents as a result of the research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has been asked for comment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The glasses are being described as “more upscale and feature-rich” than the AirPods and the AI pendant, however.

Of this, $1 billion is dedicated to early-stage investments, while the rest is for growth-stage investments, according to an <a href=\"https://www.thrivecap.com/thrive-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement from the firm.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thrive told Bloomberg that this latest fundraise was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-17/josh-kushner-s-thrive-capital-raises-10-billion-in-new-funding?srnd=phx-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">oversubscribed</a>. This is the firm’s 10th fund — called Thrive X — and comes as some of the firm’s biggest investments, including OpenAI, Stripe, and SpaceX, continue to soar in value. Some of the firm’s other notable investments include Databricks, Anduril, and Cursor. The firm also incubates companies, having spun up 12 so far, with at least six now having reached unicorn status.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s strategy is to “commit deeply to a small number of founders,” the firm said in its announcement. “Concentration demands loyalty to the founders and missions we back.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speaking to Bloomberg, Josh Kushner, founder of the firm, said he believed the winners of the AI boom would “be bigger than we can ever imagine,” and that the technology is still nascent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thrive’s massive raise also hints at something else.

Felser noticed it was a common occurrence among startups producing novel materials. Felser, who previously founded and invested in software startups, said the problem they faced seemed a bit unfair. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Software companies sell at a negative margin all the time in the beginning, you know, Uber, Lyft, you can look at lots of different examples,” he said. “But for materials companies, they’re not allowed to do that. One of the questions I had is, ‘Why is that?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Felser found that unlike software companies, which can quickly add more capacity from cloud service providers, materials startups face a market skeptical of their ability to scale up production without a guaranteed customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Felser decided to give them one. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He doesn’t run a company with a big budget for clever materials, but he knows a few. And as a climate tech investor, he knows more than a few startups that could benefit from a well-known customer.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Felser has been quietly working on a new project, called Material Scale, that brings the two sides together using a hybrid debt-equity investment vehicle to give materials startups a boost, TechCrunch has learned. Material Scale will initially focus on climate tech startups in the apparel industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Material Scale is betting on startups with commercial-ready products that are ready to scale if a customer can purchase in bulk. Buyers will commit enough funds to cover the cost of the material at market price. Material Scale will fund the difference through a combination of loans and warrants in the startup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s really minimally dilutive,” Felser said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ralph Lauren is joining the platform as a buyer for the initial launch of Material Scale. Investor <a href=\"https://www.structureclimate.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Structure Climate</a> is joining Climactic as a general partner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Money from purchase orders flows from the buyer through Material Scale to the startup. “In effect, we buy it and then simultaneously sell it,” Felser said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deals between Material Scale and the buyer and between Material Scale and the startup will be inked essentially at the same time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Once they sign the deals, this’ll be interesting because the value of the company has significantly changed because they’ve now got a buyer and they’ve got funding to achieve scale,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Material Scale hasn’t executed any deals yet; Felser said he has large apparel manufacturers interested in participating and a long roster of startups that could use the funding. “The startups all want it,” he said. “We have a big list of companies that are candidates that we’re talking with.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first investments will come out of a special purpose vehicle totaling about $11 million. Felser hopes to eventually branch out into other, similar markets like alternative fuels, eventually growing the Material Scale concept to nine figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He hopes other investors will steal his idea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need more novel instruments like this to attack climate change,” he said. “We want to be nimble and be able to take advantage of opportunities when we see them and not just be doing the same old thing.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The OpenAI competitor has agreed to buy <a href=\"https://www.koyeb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Koyeb</a>, a Paris-based startup that simplifies AI app deployment at scale and manages the infrastructure behind it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mistral has been primarily known for developing large language models (LLMs), but this deal confirms its ambitions to position itself as a full-stack player. In <a href=\"https://x.com/MistralAI/status/1932798814840332307\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">June 2025</a>, it had announced <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/products/compute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mistral Compute</a>, an AI cloud infrastructure offering which it now hopes Koyeb will accelerate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2020 by three former employees of French cloud provider Scaleway, Koyeb aimed to help developers process data <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/koyeb-is-a-serverless-startup-that-ingests-processes-and-stores-data-from-multiple-cloud-providers/\">without worrying about server infrastructure</a> — a concept known as serverless. This approach gained relevance as AI grew more demanding, also inspiring the recent launch of <a href=\"https://www.koyeb.com/blog/koyeb-sandboxes-fast-scalable-fully-isolated-environments-for-ai-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Koyeb Sandboxes</a>, which provide isolated environments to deploy AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before the acquisition, Koyeb’s platform already helped users deploy models from Mistral and others. In a <a href=\"https://www.koyeb.com/blog/koyeb-is-joining-mistral-ai-to-build-the-future-of-ai-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>, Koyeb said its platform will continue operating. But its team and technology will now also help Mistral deploy models directly on clients’ own hardware (on premises), optimize its use of GPUs, and help scale AI inference — the process of running a trained AI model to generate responses — according to a press release from Mistral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, Koyeb’s 13 employees and its three co-founders, Yann Léger, Edouard Bonlieu, and Bastien Chatelard (pictured above in 2020), are set to join the engineering team of Mistral, overseen by CTO and co-founder Timothée Lacroix. Under his leadership, Koyeb expects its platform to transition into a “core component” of Mistral Compute over the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Koyeb’s product and expertise will accelerate our development on the Compute front, and contribute to building a true AI cloud,” Lacroix wrote in a statement. Mistral has been ramping up its cloud ambitions. Just a few days ago, the company announced <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/mistral-ai-infrastructure-sweden.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a $1.4 billion investment in data centers in Sweden</a> amid growing demand for alternatives to U.S. infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Koyeb had raised <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/koyeb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$8.6 million to date</a>, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/koyeb-raises-1-6-million-for-its-serverless-data-processing-engine/\">a $1.6 million pre-seed round</a> in 2020, followed in 2023 by a <a href=\"https://www.koyeb.com/blog/we-raised-7m-to-simplify-app-deployment-with-our-global-serverless-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$7 million seed round</a> led by Paris-based VC firm Serena, whose principal Floriane de Maupeou celebrated the acquisition. For the firm, this combination will play a key role “in building the foundations of sovereign AI infrastructure in Europe,” she told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In part thanks to these geopolitical tailwinds, but also due to its focus on helping enterprises unlock value from AI, Mistral recently passed the milestone of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/664249e7-e8d5-4425-b397-ad3ed590b305\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$400 million in annual recurring revenue</a>. Koyeb, too, will be focused on enterprise clients going forward, and new users will no longer be able to sign up for its Starter tier. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mistral didn’t disclose financial terms of the deal, and it is unknown whether other acquisitions are in the works. But speaking at Stockholm’s Techarena conference last week, CEO Arthur Mensch said Mistral is hiring for infrastructure and other roles, pitching the company to prospective employees as an organization that is “headquartered in Europe, that is doing frontier research in Europe.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

CEO Brashears, President Ramos, and VP of Product Grown-Haeberli realized the opportunity when designing a new generation of compute-hungry SpaceX satellites forced them to assess the optical transceiver market, and they saw its limitations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Optical transceivers are particularly important for data centers aimed at training and operating large deep learning models, because they allow multiple GPUs to work in concert. One established U.S. supplier, AOI, <a href=\"https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/aoi-ramps-its-focus-800g-optics-data-centers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">won a contract</a> worth $4 billion to provide components for AWS data centers last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Someone will brag about a million GPU cluster; you have to multiply by four to five for the number of transceivers in that cluster,” Brashears explained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s goal is to manufacture a thousand units per day within the year so they can begin qualifying for bulk orders in 2027 and 2028.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The optical transceiver market is dominated by Chinese firms and suppliers, and Mesh sees an advantage in building its supply chain outside of that country. While trade restrictions haven’t impacted the market yet, the founders and their backers see themselves as getting in front of a national security dilemma. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If AI is the most important technology in several generations (which we believe to be true), to have critical parts of AI data center capex run through misaligned/competitive countries is a problem,” Thrive Partner Philip Clark wrote TechCrunch. “In the immediate term, Mesh is solving our need for better ways to do interconnect if we want to keep scaling AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The challenge for Mesh, the founders say, is executing lights-out, automated manufacturing techniques, which aren’t common in U.S. industry. So much of this expertise is concentrated in China that even European equipment suppliers expect Chinese customers — one German firm’s standard intake form asks for a Chinese company registration number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By co-locating design and production, the founders hope to realize more efficient and lower-cost components. Their current design removes one commonly used but power-hungry component, which Ramos said could reduce GPU cluster power usage by 3% to 5%, a meaningful amount as hyperscalers seek to wring as much efficiency out of their systems as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers are just the beginning of Mesh’s aspirations; the company sees optical wavelength communications as the next paradigm in communications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The world has primarily focused on [radio frequencies] for a long time,” Brashears told TechCrunch. “We want to be at the precipice of transition from RF to photonics…we want to interconnect everything, and not just computers, but that’s where we’re starting.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As hyperscalers prepare to build out billions of dollars’ worth of new data centers, the price for DRAM chips has jumped <a href=\"https://datatrack.trendforce.com/Chart/content/4694/mainstream-dram-spot-price\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">roughly 7x in the last year</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, there’s a growing discipline in orchestrating all that memory to make sure the right data gets to the right agent at the right time. The companies that master it will be able to make the same queries with fewer tokens, which can be the difference between folding and staying in business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/another-conversation-with-val-bercovici\">Semiconductor analyst </a><a href=\"https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/another-conversation-with-val-bercovici\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Doug O’Laughlin</a> has an interesting look at the importance of memory chips on his Substack, where he talks with Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka. They’re both semiconductor guys, so the focus is more on the chips than the broader architecture; the implications for AI software are pretty significant too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I was particularly struck by this passage, in which Bercovici looks at the growing complexity of <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anthropic’s prompt-caching documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tell is if we go to Anthropic’s prompt caching pricing page. It started off as a very simple page six or seven months ago, especially as Claude Code was launching — just “use caching, it’s cheaper.” Now it’s an encyclopedia of advice on exactly how many cache writes to pre-buy. You’ve got 5-minute tiers, which are very common across the industry, or 1-hour tiers — and nothing above. That’s a really important tell. Then of course you’ve got all sorts of arbitrage opportunities around the pricing for cache reads based on how many cache writes you’ve pre-purchased.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question here is how long Claude holds your prompt in cached memory: You can pay for a 5-minute window, or pay more for an hour-long window. It’s much cheaper to draw on data that’s still in the cache, so if you manage it right, you can save an awful lot. There is a catch though: Every new bit of data you add to the query may bump something else out of the cache window.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is complex stuff, but the upshot is simple enough: Managing memory in AI models is going to be a huge part of AI going forward. Companies that do it well are going to rise to the top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And there is plenty of progress to be made in this new field. Back in October, I covered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/tensormesh-raises-4-5m-to-squeeze-more-inference-out-of-ai-server-loads/\">a startup called Tensormesh</a> that was working on one layer in the stack known as cache optimization.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opportunities exist in other parts of the stack. For instance, lower down the stack, there’s the question of how data centers are using the different types of memory they have. (The interview includes a nice discussion of when DRAM chips are used instead of HBM, although it’s pretty deep in the hardware weeds.) Higher up the stack, end users are figuring out how to structure their model swarms to take advantage of the shared cache.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As companies get better at memory orchestration, they’ll use fewer tokens and inference will get cheaper. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://ramp.com/velocity/ai-is-getting-cheaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">models are getting more efficient at processing each token</a>, pushing the cost down still further. As server costs drop, a lot of applications that don’t seem viable now will start to edge into profitability.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
