The service costs $2.99 per month and features a library of nearly 10,000 hours of content from its partners, including Lionsgate, Warner Bros. Discovery, and FilmRise, alongside select Roku Original titles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says subscribers will be able to watch titles like “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “The Blind Side,” “Weeds,” and “Kids in the Hall,” as well as rom-coms, medical dramas, ‘90s comedy, and the like.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Howdy is ad-free and designed to complement, not compete with, premium services,” said Roku founder and CEO, Anthony Wood, in a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250805651794/en/Roku-Launches-Howdy-an-Ad-Free-Subscription-Video-Service-Offering-Award-Winning-Entertainment-at-%242.99-Per-Month\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes two months after Roku <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/05/roku-acquires-streaming-tv-bundle-service-frndly-tv-185-million-1236383110/#:~:text=Roku%20is%20paying%20$185%20million,Fubo%20and%20Hulu%20+%20Live%20TV.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">paid $185 million to acquire Frndly TV,</a> a streaming service that offers live TV, on demand video and cloud-based DVR.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Howdy joins the company’s Roku Channel, its free, ad-supported (FAST) streaming service.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google DeepMind has revealed Genie 3, its latest foundation world model that the AI lab says presents a crucial stepping stone on the path to artificial general intelligence, or human-like intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Genie 3 is the first real-time interactive general purpose world model,” Shlomi Fruchter, a research director at DeepMind, said during a press briefing. “It goes beyond narrow world models that existed before. It’s not specific to any particular environment. It can generate both photo-realistic and imaginary worlds, and everything in between.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Genie 3, which is still in research preview and not publicly available, builds on both its predecessor<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/deepminds-genie-2-can-generate-interactive-worlds-that-look-like-video-games/\"> Genie 2</a> – which can generate new environments for agents – and DeepMind’s latest video generation model <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/google-rolls-out-its-new-veo-3-video-generation-model-globally/\">Veo 3 </a>– which exhibits a deep understanding of physics. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Real-time-Interactivity.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034135\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google DeepMind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a simple text prompt, Genie 3 can generate multiple minutes – up from 10 to 20 seconds in Genie 2 – of diverse, interactive, 3D environments at 24 frames per second with a resolution of 720p. The model also features “promptable world events,” or the ability to use a prompt to change the generated world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps most importantly, Genie 3’s simulations stay physically consistent over time because the model is able to remember what it had previously generated – an emergent capability that DeepMind researchers didn’t explicitly program into the model. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fruchter said that while Genie 3 clearly has implications for educational experiences and new generative media like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/could-googles-veo-3-be-the-start-of-playable-world-models/\">gaming</a> or prototyping creative concepts, its real unlock will manifest in training agents for general purpose tasks, which he said is essential to reaching AGI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think world models are key on the path to AGI, specifically for embodied agents, where simulating real world scenarios is particularly challenging,”Jack Parker-Holder, a research scientist on DeepMind’s open-endedness team, said during a briefing.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prompt-to-World.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034136\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google DeepMind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Genie 3 is designed to solve that bottleneck. Like Veo, it doesn’t rely on a hard-coded physics engine. Instead, it teaches itself how the world works – how objects move, fall, and interact – by remembering what it has generated and reasoning over long time horizons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The model is auto-regressive, meaning it generates one frame at a time,” Fruchter told TechCrunch in a separate interview. “It has to look back at what was generated before to decide what’s going to happen next. That’s a key part of the architecture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That memory creates consistency in its simulated worlds, and that consistency allows it to develop a kind of intuitive grasp of physics, similar to how humans understand that a glass teetering on the edge of a table is about to fall, or that they should duck to avoid a falling object.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ability to simulate coherent, physically plausible environments over time makes Genie 3 much more than a generative model. It becomes an ideal training ground for general-purpose agents. Not only can it generate endless, diverse worlds to explore, but it also has the potential to push agents to their limits – forcing them to adapt, struggle, and learn from their own experience in a way that mirrors how humans learn in the real world. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prompt-Event.gif?w=480\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034137\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google DeepMind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, the range of actions an agent can take is still limited. For example, the promptable world events allow for a wide range of environmental interventions, but they’re not necessarily performed by the agent itself. Similarly, it’s still difficult to accurately model complex interactions between multiple independent agents in a shared environment. Genie 3 can also only support a few minutes of continuous interaction, when hours would be necessary for proper training. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Genie 3 presents a compelling step forward in teaching agents to go beyond reacting to inputs so they can plan, explore, seek out uncertainty, and improve through trial and error – the kind of self-driven, embodied learning that’s key in moving towards general intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We haven’t really had a Move 37 moment for embodied agents yet, where they can actually take novel actions in the real world,” Parker-Holder said, referring to the legendary moment in the 2016 game of Go between DeepMind’s AI agent AlphaGo and world champion Lee Sedol, in which Alpha Go played an unconventional and brilliant move that became symbolic of AI’s ability to discover new strategies beyond human understanding. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But now, we can potentially usher in a new era,” he said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company on Tuesday announced the launch of its $11.99 per month Audiobooks+ plan in the market, which allows subscribers or their household members on a Family or Duo plan to add 15 hours of audiobook listening during the month on top of the base plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Spotify <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/spotify-brings-audiobooks-to-u-s-users-with-a-catalog-of-300000-titles-to-start/\">launched</a> its audiobooks service in the U.S. back in 2022, household members on Duo and Family plans have long been left out. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The offering makes audiobooks available to household members for the first time in the U.S. market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through Spotify Premium, subscribers already have access to 15 hours of audiobook listening per month and can buy additional hours to top off that, as needed. However, the Audiobooks+ plan gives subscribers the option to add on recurring access to 15 additional hours every month, on top of the Premium plan’s existing monthly allotment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While that may be overkill for any but the more voracious audiobook listeners, the U.S. rollout of Audiobooks+ also means that other members on a subscription plan besides the cardholder can now also access Spotify’s audiobooks catalog for the first time. This is made possible through the add-on called “Audiobooks+ for Plan Members.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the launch, the U.S. joins a handful of other markets with access to Audiobooks+, including Ireland, Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg\" alt=\"a photo containing three screenshots of the Audiobooks+ feature in Spotify on iOS.\" class=\"wp-image-3034106\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1200,683 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1280,729 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=430,245 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=720,410 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=900,513 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=800,456 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1536,875 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=668,380 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=659,375 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=1084,617 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=708,403 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Audiobooks-Consumer-Screen-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement of the plan’s expansion to the U.S. comes shortly after a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/spotify-spot-stock-q2-2025-earnings.html\">tough quarter</a> for the streaming giant, where it missed expectations and reported weak guidance. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek pointed to a weaker ads business as the cause. (Spotify’s ads chief had just left for DoorDash, media outlets reported ahead of earnings.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the loss, one bright spot for the company in the quarter was its user growth. Active users grew 11% to 696 million, and paid subscribers grew 12% to 276 million during the second quarter. The goal with the new Audiobooks+ plan is to extract more money from those existing customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, publisher HarperCollins teased a solution for the problem with household members’ inability to access audiobooks. HarperCollins CEO Brian Murray said at the time that Spotify was working to adjust a “technical problem” with family plans that limited audiobook streaming only to the family plan’s credit card holder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, Spotify made good on that promise when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/spotify-expands-audiobook-access-to-family-plan-members-for-the-first-time/\">expanded</a> audiobook access to plan members for the first time with the launch of Audibooks+ in several non-U.S. markets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify doesn’t share how many of its Premium subscribers stream audiobooks in addition to music or podcasts, but notes that audiobook listening hours are up more than 35% year-over-year in the U.S., U.K., and Australia. Notably, that’s before these add-on plans became available. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news of the new subscription follows Spotify’s announcement on Monday that its subscription prices are increasing from €10,99 to €11,99 across markets in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify says it will experiment with other options for book fans in the future, including direct sales.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said it is “actively investigating these incidents to determine whether they are connected to a previously disclosed vulnerability or if a new vulnerability may be responsible.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s alert comes as security researchers say they have identified hackers targeting SonicWall devices to gain initial access to a victim’s network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hackers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/a-brief-history-of-mass-hacks/\">increasingly targeting enterprise products</a>, like firewalls and VPNs, which work as digital gatekeepers, allowing legitimate employees access to the company’s network. But security flaws in these products can allow malicious hackers in, enabling attackers to launch data-stealing or destructive attacks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Security firm Arctic Wolf <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/arctic-wolf-observes-july-2025-uptick-in-akira-ransomware-activity-targeting-sonicwall-ssl-vpn/\">said it has seen intrusions</a> targeting SonicWall customers as far back as mid-July. The company said “available evidence points to the existence of a zero-day vulnerability,” referring to a security bug that was discovered and exploited before the vendor could patch the issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers said they witnessed a short gap between the exploitation of the SonicWall firewall and the subsequent deployment of file-encrypting malware, or ransomware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huntress Labs, another cybersecurity firm, said it <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/exploitation-of-sonicwall-vpn\">is “likely” that a zero-day bug in SonicWall firewalls is to blame</a> for the attacks, and warned that the hackers exploiting the bug have been seen gaining access to a company’s domain controllers, which manages the devices and users on that network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its blog, Huntress said it believes the Akira ransomware gang is behind some of the attacks targeting SonicWall customers. Akira has been known to target enterprise products, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/hackers-are-exploiting-a-new-fortinet-firewall-bug-to-breach-company-networks/\">like Fortinet firewalls</a>, to break into large networks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a critical, ongoing threat,” wrote Huntress.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Canty and Carol C. Villegas, lead trial attorneys in the case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Companies like Meta that covertly profit from users’ most intimate information must be held accountable. Today’s outcome reinforces the fundamental right to privacy—especially when it comes to sensitive health data,” they added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta disagreed with the verdict and said that the company never eavesdropped on Flo users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We vigorously disagree with this outcome and are exploring all legal options. The plaintiffs’ claims against Meta are simply false. User privacy is important to Meta, which is why we do not want health or other sensitive information, and why our terms prohibit developers from sending any,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Flo raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/fertility-tracking-app-flo-health-raises-200m-at-a-1b-valuation/\">$200 million in Series C funding from General Atlantic</a> at a valuation of over $1 billion.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This forced Duraisamy to cover significant travel expenses out of pocket and file endless expense reports. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was a constant pain,” Duraisamy explained on the call. “I’d spend my weekends uploading receipts, reconciling every expense manually.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Alaan, the company he launched with fellow McKinsey alumnus <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ae.linkedin.com/in/karun-kurien-3020504b\">Karun Kurien</a>, is the Middle East’s leading spend management platform. It just announced that it raised $48 million in Series A funding led by Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India &amp; SEA) with participation from others like founders of 885 Capital, Y Combinator, 468 Capital, and Pioneer Fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders of some of Alaan’s unicorn customers, like Hosam Arab (Tabby), Mudassir Sheikha (Careem), and Khalid Al Ameri, a well-known YouTuber in the region, also invested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is one of the largest Series A rounds for a fintech in the region, compared to Saudi Arabia’s buy now, pay later platform Tamara, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tamara.co/en-SA/press-release-2\">which raised $110 million</a> a couple of years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The category has demonstrated strong product-market fit in the MENA region, and Alaan stands out as the category leader,” said GV Ravishankar, Managing Director at Peak XV. “Their customer-centric and product-led mindset has enabled them to build solutions tailored to modern finance teams.” (Peak XV also participated in a large Series B round last month, backing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/uae-proptech-huspy-raises-59m-to-scale-in-europe/\">UAE’s proptech Huspy</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alaan’s path to category leadership wasn’t without challenges, however.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the fintech raised a $2.5 million seed round in mid-2021, it couldn’t launch for nearly a year, largely due to regulatory complexities and the need for banking partnerships in the UAE. Its recent expansion into Saudi Arabia posed similar hurdles, taking years to secure approvals from the country’s apex bank before finally launching this January. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The biggest challenge we faced, both in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, was simply going live,” the CEO shared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet, Duraisamy said the fintech was able to move fast in other ways such as in Alaan’s pioneering move to integrate Apple Pay into its B2B offerings, something previously unavailable to finance teams in the region. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early 2023, the company also claimed to be the first in the Middle East to integrate OpenAI into its services, a move Duraisamy says shaped the company’s current product strategy. Initially, Alaan rolled out a chatbot, anticipating that users would enjoy conversational interactions around their spending. But the feature failed to gain traction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lesson learned, the fintech shifted focus, realizing customers got more value when AI worked in the background. Alaan began using AI to help streamline  processes like receipt matching, reconciliation, and VAT extraction—a particularly valuable use case in the region, where the platform helps businesses navigate complex VAT regulations and reclaimable tax.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims its spend management platform has already saved finance teams more than 1.5 million hours of manual work. Its a number Alaan expects to grow as it continues to invest in automation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching in 2022, Alaan has processed over 2.5 million transactions for more than 1,500 finance teams across major regional enterprises, including G42, Careem, Tabby, and Lulu Group.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, the company is profitable, Duraisamy says, noting that it spent $5 million to generate $10 million in revenue. Duraisamy credits YC and his mentors for instilling a disciplined approach in a market where many fintechs are focused on payment volumes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Alaan is looking to replicate its growth in Saudi Arabia, where it launched earlier this year and has been doubling transaction volumes month over month for the past six months, according to the startup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series A will accelerate this expansion, allowing the company to scale hiring across sales, customer success, and compliance, while also doubling down on AI-driven finance automation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the four-year-old fintech, which is equipping MENA finance teams with AI agents, has now raised one of the largest Series A rounds in MENA, I asked Duraisamy if Ramp’s explosive growth—its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/ramp-hits-22-5b-valuation-just-45-days-after-reaching-16b/\">valuation has doubled this year after raising three rounds</a>—played a role in investors betting big on Alaan.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you talk to investors, what really matters for a company at our stage is the fundamentals: how capital-efficient we are, how much revenue we generate, how strong our go-to-market motion is,” he said. “We are not in a market where you know size is an advantage, like the US or Europe. So, regardless of whether Ramp was able to raise or not, I think we would have raised this much because our fundamentals were very strong.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In the first half of 2025 alone, the startup recorded $250 million in gross merchandise value (GMV), up nearly 1.5 times year-over-year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its digital banking arm, Uzum Bank, launched a co-branded Visa debit card with pre-approved credit limits in August last year. That product has already issued 2 million cards and is on track to surpass 5 million by year-end. Meanwhile, Uzum’s unsecured lending business hit $200 million in financed volume in Q1, growing 3.4 times from the same period last year. The startup also <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/uzum-holding-ltd-uzum-or-the-company-fy2024-results-302385292.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted</a> $150 million in net income in 2024 — a 50% year-over-year jump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a portfolio spanning e-commerce, fintech, and digital banking, how has a startup just over three years old managed to scale this quickly — and draw the attention of global investors like Tencent?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uzum founder and CEO Djasur Djumaev attributes the success to a combination of deep local knowledge and disciplined execution. He believes that understanding the country’s culture, consumer behavior, and business environment — and pairing that with the technical and operational expertise that global companies have developed — has been critical to building a business that can scale quickly and sustainably.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built its digital and physical infrastructure from scratch to kick off its business in Uzbekistan. This includes setting a logistics capacity that has grown to than 112,000 square meters, with a storage capacity of 1.1 million square feet, allowing it to process more than 200,000 orders per day. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has also set up more than 1,500 pickup points across 450 cities, towns, settlements, and villages in the country to enable next-day deliveries. These pickup points also allow the issuance and distribution of Uzum Bank cards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Betting on local expertise and infrastructure in frontier markets gives you an advantage to then perform and scale your business very fast,” Djumaev told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033913\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Uzum’s pickup point</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Uzum</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, Uzum operated on a fulfilled-by-operator model to enable e-commerce deliveries. It has since expanded to include fulfillment-by-seller and delivery-by-seller options, with a goal of routing 20–30% of deliveries through these new models. These new delivery models will also help Uzum expand its stock-keeping units, which are currently over 1.5 million available for its next-day delivery service, up from over 600,000 SKUs at the time of its last funding announcement in March 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked what brought Tencent onto its cap-table this time, Uzum’s chief strategy and business development officer, Nikolay Seleznev, told TechCrunch the startup’s strong growth metrics convinced the Chinese investor to come on board after several quarters of ongoing discussions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uzum plans to grow its fintech business by introducing a deposit product in September and a long-term (more than 12 months in maturity) credit facility for its B2C customers. The startup also plans to expand its merchant base and help its existing and new merchants with its QR code payment processing system, expand its Visa debit card program, and build new products to support small and medium enterprises in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, the startup plans to introduce new products adding value-added services to its e-commerce business, including those helping to generate advertisement revenues. It is also working toward scaling its financial infrastructure further with AI increasingly embedded across credit scoring, fraud protection, and personalized user experiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Furthermore, Uzum plans to open up its e-commerce marketplace for international merchants, beginning with those in China and Turkey in September.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are expecting 10 to 15% of cross-border activity coming from these countries,” Seleznev said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has over 12,000 people in its workforce, including blue-collar workers at its pickup points, as well as tech, engineering, and product teams across all its business verticals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to other businesses of its sort, which are profitable and have multiple avenues to generate continuous income over time, Uzum has plans to become public in the medium term. But before that, it aims to raise a Series B round of $250–$300 million in the first half of 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the startup has so far raised $137 million in equity, including the latest round.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With the infusion of the new capital, Jeh Aerospace has raised about $15 million in total from institutional venture capital firms. The VC fresh funding comes less than a month after the startup received an undisclosed strategic investment from IndiGo Ventures, a corporate venture capital arm of Indian carrier IndiGo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ashray Iyengar, principal at Elevation Capital, said the company “built a truly differentiated approach to aerospace manufacturing.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-aircraft-production-bottleneck\">Aircraft production bottleneck</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global air traffic demand rose 10.4% year-over-year in 2024, surpassing 2019 levels by 3.8%, per the International Air Transport Association data <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2025-releases/2025-01-30-01/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released</a> earlier this year. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rebound has spurred airlines to expand fleets, pushing up orders even as the industry grapples with talent and production bottlenecks, as Deloitte <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">notes</a> in a recent report.

That premise has shaped how Sanghavi, the former chief operating officer at Tata Boeing Aerospace, and Mudragalla have built its 100-person workforce, team of advisers, and business model.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033676\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg 1628w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=768,484 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=680,429 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=1200,756 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=1280,807 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=430,271 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=720,454 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=900,567 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=800,504 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=1536,968 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=668,421 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=595,375 595w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=979,617 979w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=708,446 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1628px) 100vw, 1628px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>McKinsey Aerospace &amp; Defense Practice</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of working directly with OEMs like Airbus and Boeing, which makes makes 30% of commercial aircraft, Jeh Aerospace deliberately decided to tap Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturers, Sanghavi told TechCrunch, adding this group makes 60% to 70% of aircraft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently has half a dozen paying customers, including Vermont-based GS Precision and Ohio-headquartered RH Aero. Sanghavi said each of these customers is a “high dollar, high ARR customer,” and they have the potential to become large accounts in the next one to two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we believe is that to work with lesser, but better customers, not to have a transactional relationship, but a far deeper and meaningful relationship. So, we are also very, very focused on not having too many customers,” he said. “The business doesn’t need too many customers because you can really scale with few customers very fast and very quickly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also assembled an advisory team with deep ties to commercial aircraft OEMS. The startup counts former Boeing India President Pratyush (Prat) Kumar and former Airbus India CEO and Managing Director Dwaraka Srinivasan among its early advisors and backers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jeh Aerospace has made notable manufacturing and financial progress in its short life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its $2.75 million seed round in January last year, Jeh Aerospace says it has delivered more than 100,000 flight-critical components and tools on time. The startup has also established a machine capacity exceeding 250,000 hours annually.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the last financial year, the startup reached $6 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and achieved profitability after taxes. Sanghavi told TechCrunch that it projects a 3x to 4x increase in its ARR this year and also boasts an order book worth $100 million.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033706\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Jeh Aerospace’s facility includes an Center for Aerospace Skill for talent training</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jeh Aerospace</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use the new $11 million in capital to scale its manufacturing and inspection capabilities by investing in next-generation digital production technologies, Sanghavi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Jeh Aerospace co-founders see an opportunity to bring more local manufacturing to India and trengthen the country’s position on the global aerospace map, much like its recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/trump-tells-apples-ceo-to-stop-expanding-iphone-production-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">emergence as a hub for iPhone production</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India already plays a growing role in aerospace manufacturing, with Airbus <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/airbus-increasing-sourcing-from-india-but-a-plant-will-have-to-wait-ceo/articleshow/119530099.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sourcing $1.4 billion</a> worth of components annually from the country and targeting $2 billion by 2030.

Designers could communicate freely on the platform and then either share a 3.5% revenue cut on clients they converted, or they could pay for <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Pro subscription</a> to skip the rev share. In March, the company tightened the rules further, saying that anyone finding clients on Dribbble would need to offer the platform a cut of their revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It went from it was optional to use our transactional features to it was required for non-advertisers to use our transactional features, if they were on Dribbble, to find clients,” explains <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/canastasakis/\">Dribbble CEO </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/canastasakis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Constantine Anastasakis</a>, in an interview with TechCrunch. “If a user is on Dribbble to find inspiration or to get feedback on their work, or to talk shop with their peers, none of this affects them,” he added.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033928\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg 3378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1200,629 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1280,671 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=720,377 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=900,472 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=800,419 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1536,805 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=2048,1073 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=668,350 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1178,617 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=708,371 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Dribbble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec, who joined the company after working at direct-to-consumer lender Lower, video marketplace Pond5 (exited to Shutterstock), and freelancer marketplace Fiverr, was hired last April to pivot Dribbble into a marketplace. While the company is profitable under parent company <a href=\"https://www.tiny.com/companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tiny</a>, it’s still a small 20-person team and isn’t reliant on venture backing to serve its 7.5 to 10 million monthly unique visitors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Dribbble was something that really accelerated our business dramatically back in the day,” Kuznetsov told TechCrunch. Before Dribbble, there was no platform where designers could share their work with others, he says. It helped designers receive feedback that came specifically from their peers and allowed newer designers to learn from those at the top of the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov is now part of the latter group. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Milkinside, Kuznetsov has worked with companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Scandinavian Airlines, United Airlines, Honda, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, and other large companies in the Bay Area. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, he likely didn’t feel that Dribbble would risk banning him for not abiding by the new terms. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anastasakis essentially confirmed this to be true. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He told TechCrunch that Kuznetsov received 83 work inquiries since the new terms rolled out in March, and responded to 61. In each message, the site shows a warning that reminds users that contact details should not be shared before project payment. However, Kuznetsov shared his contact information in six messages, which would have displayed a stronger warning at that time. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

about his repeated terms-of-service violations, which informed him he was risking permanent suspension.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov told us he didn’t see this email initially, but Dribbble says it tracked that the email was opened three times before his suspension. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe that Dribbble — it was their goal to hurt me so I can spread that [news] so they can give a harsh lesson to everyone who tries [to break the rules],” Kuznetsov says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anastasakis confirmed as much to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s really no conceivable way in which he did not realize that what he was doing risked permanent suspension of his accounts,” Anastasakis told us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that ultimately it was that he believed that we wouldn’t take action against a designer of his caliber,” he continued. “As a side note, I actually think that he’s done us a big favor as far as getting the word out about how seriously we take the terms.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Kuznetsov, or any designer who was banned for similar reasons, the only option to come back to Dribbble is by joining as an advertiser, which requires a minimum campaign budget of $1,500 per month for at least three months. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-competitor-to-dribbble-emerges\">A new competitor to Dribbble emerges?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov has decided to forge his own path, saying that he’s hurt by Dribbble’s change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not going to be a copycat of Dribbble,” he says of his pending startup. Instead, it will be a resource for designers that will also leverage AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there has been a lot of backlash about AI models training on creatives’ work without compensation, Kuznetsov believes there’s a use case for the technology in terms of inspiration, creation, and design. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1826250\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg 6555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Gleb Kuznetsov</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a big hole right now in the market … Everybody’s doing AI startups, but nobody’s really doing AI startups for designers,” Kuznetsov notes. “AI is something that really can elevate our ability to create, and make it on a much higher level of quality. It’s going to help us to not only earn more money and grow, but also create something we never even thought was possible to create without a specific skill set.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov says he expects to have an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MVP</a> (minimum viable product) ready in three or four months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he notes the goal is not to “kill” Dribbble, even though investors offered him money to do so. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not like that.

It’s important to note that in most cases, these reports have a human at some point of the process to verify that the AI-powered bug hunter found a legitimate vulnerability, as is the case with Big Sleep.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vlad Ionescu, co-founder and chief technology officer at RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch that Big Sleep is a “legit” project, given that it has “good design, people behind it know what they’re doing, Project Zero has the bug finding experience and DeepMind has the firepower and tokens to throw at it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is obviously a lot of promise with these tools, but also significant downsides. Several people who maintain different software projects have complained of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/ai-slop-and-fake-reports-are-exhausting-some-security-bug-bounties/\">bug reports that are actually hallucinations</a>, with some calling them the bug bounty equivalent of AI slop. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s the problem people are running into, is we’re getting a lot of stuff that looks like gold, but it’s actually just crap,” Ionescu previously told TechCrunch.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The iPhone-maker once promised to build a giant LCD factory in Wisconsin — a project that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called the “eighth wonder of the world” during his first term</a> — and wound up underdelivering to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/12/nx-s1-5359422/what-wisconsins-foxconn-plant-can-tell-us-about-the-future-of-manufacturing-in-the-u-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an extreme degree</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn says the buyer is an “existing business partner” named “Crescent Dune LLC,” an entity that was created in Delaware just 12 days ago, according to records filed with the state. Matt Dewine, a spokesperson for Foxconn, declined to say more about the buyer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn sold the factory and land for around $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million, Taiwan stock exchange filings show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Foxconn representative told <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/an-foxconn-sells-lordstown-plant-hon-hai-ev-taiwan-0804/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Automotive News</a> the company will remain “involved in the manufacturing of products for customers at the Lordstown facility” and claimed it is “committed to customers and suppliers” in the automotive industry. But The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/lordstown-ev-plant-to-be-converted-into-ai-hardware-factory-849eadfa?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiFSyhoRht1TX_V-H1hGJ-jYkL4PNPMup93UlW2B1LohiFNj2V8HlnJY-DNsiA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689100d9&amp;gaa_sig=b44CP77AVuyIDZIOMSJofm2H-hAYI5BihC3_VZ0kzZ_wOmAZt2UOE4hq7xWWnrVET72dkBxzBZpZWMX13qIzsQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported Monday</a> that Foxconn now plans to build AI servers at the factory. Dewine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn announced the deal to buy the former GM plant in 2021 for $230 million, when it was still owned by EV startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said it was going to be the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&amp;D hub in North America.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Foxconn was developing EVs of its own in Asia, it was also focused on contract manufacturing in the United States. And, in short order, three of the electric vehicle companies Foxconn hoped would occupy the factory went bankrupt.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn actually built a few EVs at the factory for the now-defunct Lordstown Motors. But the Taiwanese electronics giant wound up in a bitter fight with that troubled EV startup. Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy in June 2023, and accused Foxconn — which had become an investor in the startup — of “starving it of cash,” and said it “maliciously and in bad faith destroyed that business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn also took a flier on a small EV startup called IndiEV, claiming it would build its electric SUV at the Ohio factory. IndiEV filed for bankruptcy in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-03/second-us-foxconn-ev-customer-files-for-bankruptcy-protection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">October 2023</a> with less than $3 million in the bank.

Fisker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/fisker-bankruptcy-failure-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed for bankruptcy in June 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A fourth company, Monarch Tractor, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/monarch-tractor-lays-off-10-in-restructuring-towards-software-and-licensing-av-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not had much of an impact</a>, with Foxconn making no more than a few hundred electric tractors.

Rivian is currently able to sell EVs directly to consumers in 25 states and in Washington, D.C. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ohio’s BMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ohio’s prohibition of Rivian’s direct-sales-only business model is irrational in the extreme: it reduces competition, decreases consumer choice, and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience — all of which harm consumers — with literally no countervailing benefit,” lawyers for the company wrote in the complaint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian is asking the court to allow the company to apply for a dealership license so it can sell vehicles directly. Ohio customers have to buy from Rivian vehicles from locations in other states where direct sales are allowed. The cars are then shipped to Rivian service centers within Ohio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Allowing Rivian to sell directly would not be treading new legal ground, the company argues in its complaint. Tesla has had a license to sell in Ohio since 2013 and can sell directly to consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s stopping Rivian is a 2014 law passed by the state’s legislature. That law, which Rivian says came after an intense lobbying effort by the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association (OADA), effectively gave Tesla a carve-out and blocked any future manufacturers from acquiring the necessary dealership licenses. (The OADA did not immediately return a request for comment.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Consumer choice is a bedrock principle of America’s economy. Ohio’s archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational, and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience,” Mike Callahan, Rivian’s chief administrative officer, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian has won legal fights over direct sales before. In 2021, Rivian and Lucid Motors were granted dealership licenses to sell EVs in Illinois. That state’s dealer association sued to try to block Rivian and Lucid from selling directly but <a href=\"https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/court-rules-that-rivian-and-lucid-may-sell-vehicles-direct-to-consumers-in-illinois.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ultimately failed</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid Motors, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/news/industry-news/a41886748/lucid-motors-lawsuit-texas-dealership-rights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a lawsuit of its own in Texas in 2022</a> in a challenge to that state’s direct-sales ban.

He’s pushed hard to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, not a maker of EVs. And yet, the company’s most visible products, which generate the bulk of its revenues, are its electric cars. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, Tesla EVs are advanced, particularly when it comes to its underlying vehicle architecture and software. And its driver-assistance system known as Full Self-Driving Supervised, which can be used on highways and city streets and requires hands on the wheel and the driver to be ready to take over, is considered among the most capable on the market today. But to Musk, the ultimate illustration of an AI and robotics company is self-driving cars and humanoid robots. And today, neither of them exist at any scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s first notable step toward that goal was in June when it launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Those Robotaxi-branded vehicles, which invited customers can hail via an app, have a Tesla employee sitting in the front passenger seat. But it’s still far from Musk’s original vision of a “general solution” that would allow a Tesla owner to earn money by renting out their vehicle as a robotaxi service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The clock is ticking and Musk needs to show more progress — or at the very least tease upcoming launches to keep antsy shareholders content. Which is perhaps why Tesla is embarking on this ride-hailing gambit in California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Musk noted that Tesla would be launching a robotaxi service in the Bay Area<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1943134090179334207\"> “in a month or two”</a> — regulatory approvals being the primary hang-up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem? Tesla hasn’t even applied for the permits that would allow it to operate a robotaxi service. I checked Friday morning with the California DMV, which regulates driverless testing, and Tesla has not yet applied for the necessary permits. (A spokesperson did tell me the DMV met with Tesla to discuss the company’s plans to test autonomous vehicles in the state.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, instead Tesla has launched a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area. And yeah, users keep calling these robotaxis. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, while folks — including Musk’s brother and Tesla board member Kimbal Musk — <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/kimbal/status/1951035194984767838\">may refer to these as robotaxis</a>, they are not driving autonomously. (And if they are, it would be a violation of current regulations.) Again, Tesla does not currently have the permits to do anything beyond pay its own employees to use its fleet of EVs to drive people around the Bay Area. No autonomous driving in any way, shape, or form. You can read a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/tesla-wants-to-bring-its-robotaxis-to-san-francisco-heres-whats-standing-in-the-way/\">recent explainer here</a> that will take you through all of the various permits Tesla needs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ride-hailing launch has many folks wondering, what gives? My answer: optics.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recent chatter among some little birds suggests that the <strong>National Automobile Dealers Association</strong> is focusing its efforts on VW Group spinout <strong>Scout</strong> and the EV company’s plans for direct sales.

Logistics company Flexport had captured the attention of Silicon Valley, in part because of founder Ryan Petersen’s fallout with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/ousted-flexport-ceo-dave-clark-strikes-back/\">ousted CEO Dave Clark</a> and because of its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/01/flexport-acquires-technology-of-former-digital-freight-unicorn-convoy/\">acquisition of Convoy</a>, the former freight tech unicorn that had just shut down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s an update. Flexport has now <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/flexport-sells-former-freight-unicorn-convoys-tech-two-years-after-buying-it/\">sold the Convoy platform</a> to <strong>DAT Freight &amp; Analytics</strong>. The terms were undisclosed, although the company said it had delivered a “massive return on investment for Flexport.” Reporting from Axios’ Dan Primack suggests that, yes, indeed “massive return” is an appropriate description. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flexport never disclosed exactly what it had paid for Convoy’s tech, although reporting at the time put the figure at $16 million — a fraction of the unicorn’s previous valuation of $3.8 billion. Primack reported this week that Flexport sold the Convoy platform<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/supply-chain-deals/2025/07/29/flexport-sells-convoy-assets-dat-250m\"> for $250 million</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>AIR</strong>, an Israel-based startup developing eVTOLs,<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/air-secures-23m-to-boost-u-s-expansion-and-evtol-innovation/\"> raised $23 million</a> in a Series A funding round led by Entrée Capital, with participation from existing backer Dr. Shmuel Harlap, an early investor in Mobileye. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>LG Innotek</strong>, the components and materials subsidiary of South Korea’s LG Group, is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/aeva-strikes-lidar-chipmaking-deal-with-lg-subsidiary/\">investing up to $50 million</a> in <strong>Aeva</strong>, acquiring an equity stake of about 6% in the U.S. lidar company.

The network infrastructure giant accused Perplexity of obscuring its identity when trying to scrape web pages “in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences,” Cloudflare’s researchers wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI products like those offered by Perplexity rely on gobbling up large amounts of data from the internet, and AI startups have long scraped text, images, and videos from the internet many times without permission to make their products work. In recent times, websites have tried to fight back by using the web standard Robots.txt file, which tells search engines and AI companies which pages can be indexed and which shouldn’t, efforts <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/multiple-ai-companies-bypassing-web-standard-scrape-publisher-sites-licensing-2024-06-21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">that have seen mixed results so far</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity appears to be willingly circumventing these blocks by changing its bots’ “user agent,” meaning a signal that identifies a website visitor by their device and version type, as well as changing their autonomous system networks, or ASN, essentially a number that identifies large networks on the internet, according to Cloudflare. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals,” read Cloudflare’s post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer dismissed Cloudflare’s blog post as a “sales pitch,” adding in an email to TechCrunch that the screenshots in the post “show that no content was accessed.” In a follow-up email, Dwyer claimed the bot named in the Cloudflare blog “isn’t even ours.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare said it first noticed the behavior after its customers complained that Perplexity was crawling and scraping their sites, even after they added rules on their Robots file and for specifically blocking Perplexity’s known bots. Cloudflare said it then performed tests to check and confirmed that Perplexity was circumventing these blocks. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent, but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked,” according to Cloudflare.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also said that it has de-listed Perplexity’s bots from its verified list and added new techniques to block them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare has recently taken a public stance against AI crawlers. Last month, Cloudflare <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-launches-a-marketplace-that-lets-websites-charge-ai-bots-for-scraping/\">announced the launch of a marketplace</a> allowing website owners and publishers to charge AI scrapers who visit their sites. Cloudflare’s chief executive Matthew Prince <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/bernard-l-schwartz-annual-lecture-matthew-prince-cloudflare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sounded the alarm</a> at the time, saying AI is breaking the business model of the internet, particularly publishers. Last year, Cloudflare also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/cloudflare-launches-a-tool-to-combat-ai-bots/#:~:text=Cloudflare%20has%20set%20up%20a,demand%20for%20model%20training%20data.\">launched a free tool</a> to prevent bots from scraping websites to train AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not the first time Perplexity is accused of scraping without authorization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, news outlets, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">such as Wired</a>, alleged <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/news-outlets-are-accusing-perplexity-of-plagiarism-and-unethical-web-scraping/\">Perplexity was plagiarizing their content</a>. Weeks later, Perplexity’s CEO Aravind Srinivas <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/perplexitys-ceo-punts-on-defining-plagiarism/\">was unable to immediately answer</a> when asked to provide the company’s definition of plagiarism during an interview with TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey at the Disrupt 2024 conference.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The X owner <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1951697566325981414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> over the weekend that the company discovered the video archive for the popular short-form video app, thought to have been deleted, and is working to restore user access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vine — something of a precursor to today’s TikTok, but with only six-second-long looping videos — was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/if-twitter-gets-into-the-video-hosting-game-it-could-be-a-wonderful-and-horrible-thing/\">acquired by Twitter back in October 2012</a> for $30 million to expand the social media platform’s video ambitions. Unfortunately for Vine creators and fans, the company fumbled the app’s potential and decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine/\">shut down Vine in 2016</a> by limiting all new uploads. The following year, it was fully discontinued, though a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/twitter-just-cant-let-go-of-vine-launches-an-online-archive/\">user archive</a> remained for a time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite no longer having an App Store presence, Vine still has a place in the internet’s collective cultural consciousness. Through online compilations of the best Vines uploaded to YouTube, and through the careers of numerous creators who got their start on Vine, the company lives on to some extent, and its content continues to be discovered by new generations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk himself seemed interested in bringing back Vine after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/\">acquiring Twitter in October 2022</a>. In <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1586918804780630016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a poll posted</a> on the social media app, he asked Twitter’s users, “Bring back Vine?” to which nearly 70% responded “yes.” <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/10/31/vine-tiktok-twitter-musk-team-reboot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios reported at the time</a> that Twitter had devoted some engineers to working on the Vine reboot, but nothing ever came of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear whether Musk has any ambitions for Vine beyond getting its archive back online, however. In the same post about restoring Vine, he also touted that Grok’s new video-creation feature, Grok Imagine, also available to X Premium+ subscribers, is “AI Vine.” That suggests that his interests in video creation no longer lie with human creativity, but in human-directed AI prompting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether or not Musk will actually deliver on the promise remains to be seen, as the X post could have just been another way to draw attention to Grok AI, rather than being representative of a real effort inside the company to make old Vines available for reposting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

There are limits to how explicit one can get. Many of our spicier prompts — made in the name of Journalism! — generate blurred-out images that are “moderated” and therefore inaccessible. We were, however, able to generate semi-nude imagery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NSFW content is unsurprising for xAI, given the release last month of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/elon-musks-grok-is-making-ai-companions-including-a-goth-anime-girl/\">raunchy, hyper-sexualized anime AI companion</a>. But just as Grok’s unrestrained nature was entertaining until it started spewing hateful, antisemitic, misogynistic content, Grok Imagine could be poised to bring its own set of unintended consequences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/grok-video-generator-will-spicy-mode-says-xai-employee-rcna221807\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC first reported</a> the existence of a “<a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1952171629485711479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spicy mode</a>” last week after xAI employee Mati Roy said in a now-deleted post on X: “Grok Imagine videos have a spicy mode that can <a href=\"https://x.com/dreamworks2050/status/1952301119608398124\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">do nudity</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The existing limitations with Grok Imagine are somewhat heartening given the model also lets you create content of celebrities — anyone from Donald Trump to Taylor Swift — and there appear to be additional restrictions on those. For example, TechCrunch tried, and failed, to generate an image of Trump pregnant. Grok Imagine only generated images of Trump holding a baby or next to a pregnant woman. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s still early days for Grok Imagine, which aims to compete with incumbents like Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Runway, and Chinese rivals, the images and videos generated of humans are still a bit lost in the uncanny valley, with waxy-looking skin that verges on cartoonish at times. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the generator is impressive. It produces images in seconds from a text prompt, and continues to auto-generate new images as you scroll. Those images can then be animated into stylized videos. The user interface is also seamless and intuitive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk said<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1952104431367208981?utm_source=www.therundown.ai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=xai-launches-grok-imagine-video-generator&amp;_bhlid=f6bb04152b3f05dd8588deb56b7dc9a215665d7f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> on X</a> that the model would “get better every day.”</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
