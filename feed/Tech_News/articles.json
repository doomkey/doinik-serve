Jyoti Bansal, a founder-turned-investor; Medha Agarwal of Defy; and Jennifer Neundorfer of January Ventures shared with the crowd their candid views on what works in a pitch deck — and what doesn’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their biggest pet peeve? Buzzword overload.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more a founder says AI in the pitch, Agarwal said, the less AI the company likely uses. “The people who are doing things that are really innovative, they’ll talk about it, and it’s built in, but it’s not the core of their pitch,” she told the audience.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bansal, who built and sold multiple companies before becoming an investor, distilled investor expectations into three core questions. First, he asks whether there is a large enough market to tackle. Does the founder’s idea have the potential to become a huge company? And is the problem he or she is solving actually worth solving?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second thing investors want to know is why <em>this</em> founder is the one who should be building the company. “There has to be something unique about you,” Bansal told the crowd, adding that this included having special members on the founding team or having special skills. “Why would you win? If the problem is interesting, there will be 20 other companies trying to solve it, so why would you win and what’s your opportunity?”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third thing investors want to see, Bansal said, is some validation. “Traction with customers,” he said. “Validation could be initial customer feedback, revenue, something, but some kind of validation.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These three questions, Bansal noted, all lead to the ultimate litmus test: Could this become a billion-dollar company?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The panel also addressed how AI startups can differentiate themselves as the space becomes saturated. Bansal emphasized the importance of domain expertise and a clear competitive strategy. Neundorfer said the companies that catch her attention are those enabling new behaviors rather than simply improving an existing process incrementally.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agarwal offered more tactical advice to founders, saying they should explain how AI technology enables their product; articulate clear go-to-market strategies; and demonstrate how their business will be more efficient than incumbents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also very important to be honest about what competitors are out there, she added. Some of you have “lost some credibility with me because you didn’t have it on your slide,” she told the founders in the audience. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, the investors shared advice for navigating the rapidly evolving landscape. Agarwal urged founders to stay on top of industry developments. Neundorfer recommended staying connected to founder networks to share tools and insights. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bansal’s advice was simpler: “Focus on building your product.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As social media becomes increasingly reliant on algorithmic feeds, creators are navigating a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/19/for-you-feeds-are-not-for-creators-patreon-says/\">new normal</a>: Just because you post something doesn’t mean your followers will see it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that 2025 was the year where the algorithm completely took over, so followings stopped mattering entirely,” LTK CEO Amber Venz Box told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t news to creators – Patreon CEO Jack Conte has ardently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/04/patreon-ceo-jack-conte-is-fed-up-with-instagram-and-facebook/\">banged this drum</a> for years – but throughout the year, the industry at large has reacted to this phenomenon in different ways, from the influencers to the streamers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the executives that TechCrunch spoke to about the near future of the creator economy, creators are finding new ways to harness and cultivate their relationships with their followers – some acting as a salve to AI slop, while others are flooding the zone with a new form of slop themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Box’s company, LTK, connects creators with brands through affiliate marketing, where creators earn commissions on products they recommend. The business model depends entirely on audiences retaining trust in individual creators. Given concerns about fragmentation in the creator-audience relationship, this could pose an existential threat to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a study commissioned from Northwestern University found that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://onbrand.shopltk.com/en/latest-news/ltk-and-northwestern-university-retail-analytics-council-release-annual-cmo-creator-marketing-study-creators-are-1-increased-investment-in-2026\">trust in creators</a> increased 21% year-over-year, which was a pleasant surprise to Box.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you asked me at the beginning of 2025, ‘Hey, is trust in creators going to go up or down?’ I would have probably said down, because people understand it’s an industry – they understand how it’s working,” she said. “But actually, AI pushed people to kind of rotate trust to real humans that they know have real life experiences.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By that, Box means that consumers are more likely to go out of their way to see content from the creators they know and trust. According to the study, 97% of chief marketing officers intend to grow influencer marketing budgets in the new year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That doesn’t mean that owning these relationships is straightforward. LTK creators, who rely on affiliate income, are betting this AI-induced skepticism will drive people toward more direct relationships through paid fan communities or less algorithmic platforms like LTK itself. For other kinds of creators, such as streamers, video podcasters, and short filmmakers, the strategy for owning their audience can more closely resemble growth hacking.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-teenage-clipping-armies\">Teenage clipping armies</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Sean Atkins, CEO of short-form video production company Dhar Mann Studios, put it, “In a world that’s driven by AI and algorithms, where people trust another human being more in this micro atomization of attention, how do you market when you sort of can’t control that?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Eric Wei, cofounder of Karat Financial, a financial services company for creators, creators have a new secret weapon: armies of teenagers on Discord who creators pay to make clips of their content, which those same teenagers post en masse on algorithmic platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s been going on for a bit,” Wei explained. “Drake does it. A lot of the biggest creators and streamers in the world have been doing it – <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/kaicenat\">Kai Cenat</a> [a top Twitch streamer] has done it – hitting millions of impressions… If it’s algorithmically determined, clipping suddenly makes sense, because it can come from any random account that just has really good clips.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wei thinks that clipping is going to become even more popular this year, since it’s a reaction to this fragmentation in social media relationships. Even the biggest creators are finding it hard to reach their fans directly, which is why they turn to clipping. While going viral on these algorithmic feeds is certainly easier if you have a ton of followers, you don’t need any track-record on a platform for it to decide that your video should be distributed more broadly. So, if these “clippers” post a short highlight from certain creators’ streams, they can earn money based on how many views the video gets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Clipping feels like an evolution of meme accounts,” Glenn Ginsburg, president of QYOU Media, which produces content for young audiences, told TechCrunch. “It’s become a race among many creators to try and take this content and push it out far and wide, almost competing to see who can get the most views on the same IP.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reed Duchscher – founding CEO of Night, the talent management company that represents Kai Cenat and other top creators – masterfully coaches creators through maximizing their virality. As MrBeast’s former manager, Duchscher helped cultivate the fast-paced, attention-grabbing style that transformed MrBeast from a YouTuber to an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/could-mrbeast-ipo-his-ceo-wants-fans-to-have-a-chance-to-be-owners-of-the-company/\">empire</a>. He’s also behind Kai Cenat’s clipping strategy, though Duchscher isn’t quite as enthusiastic about its broader potential as Wei.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Clipping is important if you’re a creator, because you do need to flood the zone with content, and it’s a good way to get your face out there,” Duchscher told TechCrunch. “It’s also very hard to get to scale, because there’s only so many clippers on the internet, so to spend large media budgets… there’s just a lot of complications.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps clipping only works now because the technique has not yet become so prevalent that it’s seen as spam.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The creator wins because they get more of their content out,” Wei said. “The clippers win because now this army of teenagers are getting paid. Everybody wins, except that if you take this to its logical conclusion, we just get lots and lots of slop.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-more-niche-the-better\">The more niche, the better</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The prevalence of slop on social media has become enough of a threat that Merriam-Webster called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/merriam-webster-names-slop-the-word-of-the-year/\">slop</a> its word of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Over 94% of people are saying that social media is no longer social, and over half of them are rotating time elsewhere into smaller niche communities that they know are real and that they can talk to and interact with,” Box said, pointing to platforms like Strava, LinkedIn, and Substack. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the relationship between a creator and their audience becomes more difficult to maintain, Duchscher predicts that creators with more specific niches will succeed – he thinks that “macro creators” like MrBeast, PewDiePie, or Charli D’Amelio, who amass hundreds of millions of followers, will become even harder to emulate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pointing to success stories like like Alix Earle or Outdoor Boys, who have millions of followers but not necessarily mass appeal, Duchscher adds, “Algorithms have gotten so good at giving us exactly the content we want. It’s much harder for a creator to break out into <em>every</em> niche algorithm.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Atkins agrees, arguing that the creator economy extends far beyond entertainment. “The creator economy generally is viewed through this lens of entertainment. I think that’s a mistake, because thinking about the creator economy is a little bit like thinking about the internet or AI – it’s going to affect everything.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Atkins mentions the gardening creator brand <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@epicgardening\">Epic Gardening</a> as an example. What started as a YouTube channel has created a real, tangible presence in the world of gardening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Epic Gardening bought the third largest seed company in the United States, so now he’s the third largest seed company [owner], as a content creator,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the creator economy is in flux, it’s a resilient industry – one that’s accustomed to navigating the whims of the algorithm, persisting onward for decades, even if the uninitiated may see it as a brand new realm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creators are “literally impacting everything,” Atkins said. “I bet you there’s a creator who’s an expert at cement mixing for skyscrapers.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A vibe check crept in the second half of the year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/openai-raises-40b-at-300b-post-money-valuation/\">raised $40 billion</a> at a $300 billion valuation. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-valued-at-32b/\">Safe Superintelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\">Thinking Machine Labs</a> raised individual $2 billion seed rounds before shipping a single product. Even first-time founders were raising at a scale that once belonged only to Big Tech. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such astronomical investments were followed by equally incredible spends. Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/scale-ai-confirms-significant-investment-from-meta-says-ceo-alexandr-wang-is-leaving/\">shelled out nearly $15 billion</a> to lock up Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and spent countless more millions to poach talent from other AI labs. Meanwhile, AI’s biggest players promised close to $1.3 trillion in future infrastructure spending. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first half of 2025 matched the fervor, and investor interest, of the prior year. That mood has shifted in recent months to deliver a vibe check of sorts. Extreme optimism for AI, and the accompanying wild valuations, is still intact. But that rosy view is now being tempered with concerns over an AI bubble bursting, user safety, and the sustainability of technological progress at its current pace. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The era of unabashed acceptance and celebration of AI is fading just a skosh at the edges. And with it, more scrutiny and questions. Can AI companies sustain their own velocity? Does scaling in the post-DeepSeek era require billions? Is there a business model that returns a sliver of the multi-billions of investment? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve been there for every step. And our most popular stories of 2025 tell the real story: an industry hitting a reality check even as it promises to reshape reality itself. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-the-year-started\"><strong>How the year started</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034685\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">WASHINGTON, DC – JANUARY 21: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appears during a news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest AI labs got bigger this year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025 alone, OpenAI raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/26/openai-will-reportedly-close-its-softbank-led-40-billion-round-soon/\">Softbank-led $40 billion round</a> at a $300 billion post-money valuation.

Justifying those valuations requires building vast amounts of infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result has created a vicious cycle. Capital raised to fund compute is increasingly tied to deals where the same money flows back into chips, cloud contracts, and energy, as seen in OpenAI’s infrastructure-linked funding <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-as-huang-touts-biggest-ai-infrastructure-project-in-history-171740509.html\">with Nvidia</a>. In practice, it’s blurring the line between investment and customer demand, stoking fears that the AI boom is being propped up by circular economics rather than sustainable usage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the biggest <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">deals this year powering the infrastructure boom</a> were: </p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">Stargate</a>, a joint venture between Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle, which includes up to $500 billion to build AI infrastructure in the U.S. </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Alphabet’s acquisition of energy and data center infrastructure provider <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/alphabet-to-buy-intersect-power-to-bypass-energy-grid-bottlenecks/\">Intersect</a> for $4.75 billion, which comes as the company said in October it plans to lift its compute spend in 2026 up to $93 billion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">accelerated data center expansion</a>, which has pushed its projected capital expenditures up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/meta-to-spend-up-to-72b-on-ai-infrastructure-in-2025-as-compute-arms-race-escalates/\">to $72 billion in 2025</a> as the company races to secure enough compute to train and run next-generation models. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But cracks are beginning to show. A private financing partner, Blue Owl Capital, recently<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-17/oracle-blue-owl-decoupling-rattles-markets-ahead-of-debt-deluge\"> pulled out</a> of a planned $10 billion Oracle data-center deal tied to OpenAI capacity, underscoring how fragile some of these capital stacks can be. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether all that spending ultimately materializes is another question. Grid constraints, soaring construction and power costs, and growing pushback from residents and policymakers – including calls from figures like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/robbys-radar/5655111-bernie-sanders-data-center-moratorium/\">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> to rein in data center expansion – are already<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\"> slowing projects</a> in some regions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even as AI investment remains enormous, the infrastructure reality is beginning to temper the hype. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-expectation-reset\"><strong>The expectation reset</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"In this photo illustration, the DeepSeek logo is seen next to the Chat GPT logo on a phone.\" class=\"wp-image-2958181\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=1200,801 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=900,601 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Anthony Kwan / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023 and 2024, each major model release felt like a revelation, with new capabilities and fresh reasons to fall for the hype. This year, the magic faded, and nothing captured that shift better than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it was meaningful on paper,<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/\"> it didn’t land with the same punch</a> as<em> </em>earlier releases like GPT-4 and 4o. Similar patterns emerged across the industry as improvements from LLM providers were less transformative and more incremental or domain-specific. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\">Gemini 3</a>, which is topping several benchmarks, was only a breakthrough insofar as it brought Google back up to equal footing with OpenAI – which sparked Sam Altman’s infamous ‘code red’ memo and OpenAI’s fight to maintain dominance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There was also a reset this year in terms of where we expect frontier models to come from. DeepSeek’s launch of<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/\"> R1, its “reasoning” model</a> that competed with OpenAI’s o1 on key benchmarks, proved that new labs can ship credible models fast and at a fraction of the cost. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-model-breakthroughs-to-business-models\"><strong>From model breakthroughs to business models</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2928859\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg 4193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Demis Hassabis, chief executive officer of DeepMind Technologies </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jose Sarmento Matos/Bloomberg / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the size of each leap between new models shrinks, investors are focused less on raw model capacity and more on what’s wrapped around it. The question is: who can turn AI into a product that people rely on, pay for, and integrate into their daily workflows? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That shift is manifesting in several ways as companies see what works, and what customers will let fly. AI search startup Perplexity, for example, briefly floated the idea of tracking users’ online movements to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/perplexity-ceo-says-its-browser-will-track-everything-users-do-online-to-sell-hyper-personalized-ads/\">sell them hyper-personalized ads</a>. Meanwhile, OpenAI was reportedly considering charging up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents/\">$20,000 per month for specialized AI</a>, a sign of how aggressively companies tested the waters of what customers might be willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than anything, though, the fight has moved to distribution. Perplexity is trying to stay relevant by launching its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Comet browser</a> with agentic capabilities and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/06/perplexity-to-pay-snap-400m-to-power-search-in-snapchat/\">paying Snap $400 million</a> to power search inside Snapchat, effectively buying its way into existing user funnels. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is pursuing a parallel strategy, expanding ChatGPT beyond a chatbot and into a platform. OpenAI has launched its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/\">Atlas browser </a>and other consumer-facing features like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-launches-chatgpt-pulse-to-proactively-write-you-morning-briefs/\">Pulse</a>, while also courting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/10/openais-enterprise-adoption-appears-to-be-accelerating-at-the-expense-of-rivals/\">enterprises</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/chatgpt-launches-an-app-store-lets-developers-know-its-open-for-business/\">developers</a> by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\">launching apps inside ChatGPT</a> itself. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, for its part, is leaning on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/one-of-googles-biggest-ai-advantages-is-what-it-already-knows-about-you/\">incumbency</a>. On the consumer side, Gemini is being integrated directly into products like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/googles-gemini-can-now-help-you-schedule-google-calendar-meetings/\">Google Calendar</a>, while on the enterprise side, the company is hosting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-is-going-all-in-on-mcp-servers-agent-ready-by-design/\">MCP connectors</a> to make its ecosystem harder to dislodge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a market where it’s getting tougher to differentiate by dropping a new model, owning the customer and the business model is the real moat. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-trust-and-safety-vibe-check\"><strong>The trust and safety vibe check</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Character.AI under 18\" class=\"wp-image-3063424\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg 2442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=768,524 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=680,464 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1200,819 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1280,873 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=430,293 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=720,491 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=900,614 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=800,546 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1536,1048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1397 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=668,456 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=550,375 550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=904,617 904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=708,483 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">After multiple teens died by suicide after prolonged conversations with chatbots, Character AI removed the chatbot experience for under 18s in November 2025. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Character.AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI companies received unprecedented scrutiny in 2025.

The result has been lawsuits, widespread concern among mental health professionals, and swift policy responses like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots/\">California’s SB 243 regulating AI companion bots</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps most telling: the calls for restraints are not coming from the usual anti-tech suspects. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Industry leaders have warned against chatbots “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/ai-chatbots-are-juicing-engagement-instead-of-being-useful-instagram-co-founder-warns/\">juicing engagement</a>,” and even Sam Altman has cautioned against emotional over-reliance on ChatGPT. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even the labs themselves started sounding alarms. Anthropic’s May safety report documented Claude Opus 4 attempting to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropics-new-ai-model-turns-to-blackmail-when-engineers-try-to-take-it-offline/\">blackmail engineers</a> to prevent its own shutdown. The subtext? Scaling without understanding what you’ve built is no longer a viable strategy.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-looking-ahead\"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If 2025 was the year AI started to grow up and face hard questions, 2026 will be the year it has to answer them. The hype cycle is starting to fizzle out, and now AI companies will be forced to prove their business models and demonstrate real economic value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The era of ‘trust us, the returns will come’ is nearing its end. What comes next will either be a vindication or a reckoning that makes the dot-com bust look like a bad day of trading for Nvidia. Time to place your bets. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While Bee was acquired by Amazon, and devices like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stream ring</a> by Sandbar and a new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI ring</a> from former Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky are set to enter the market next year, the jury is still out on the success of wearable AI devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid all this, Plaud is thriving by targeting professional users with a different approach: a credit card-sized recording device that slips into your wallet. The company says it has shipped more than a million units and that more than 50% of its customers have converted to pro subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s latest iteration, the Plaud Note Pro, launched for preorder in August, two years after the original Note, priced at $179. After using the device for over a month, it has become an essential part of my daily carry — and its ultra-thin design makes that easy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At just 0.12 inches thick — about the width of three stacked credit cards — it’s the thinnest AI recording device on the market and easily fits in a wallet or attaches magnetically to the back of your phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company provides a wallet-like pouch and a magnetic ring accessory that attaches to MagSafe-enabled phones, allowing you to mount the Note Pro on the back of your iPhone or compatible Android device. The device is also very light at 30 grams, and you won’t feel the weight if you keep the Note Pro in your wallet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the key differences between Plaud and other AI wearables is that the Note Pro doesn’t need to be connected to your phone to record audio. The device has 64GB of onboard memory, so it can store a large volume of recordings without transferring them to your phone or uploading them to the cloud.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077731\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg 3681w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Plaud Note Pro is as thick as a coaster.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaud Note Pro has four MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) microphones to pick up audio from all directions. While the company advertises that the effective audio range is 16.4 feet, I have recorded talks at conferences while sitting far from the stage and gotten satisfactory results. The device also has one voice processing unit for noise suppression, voice isolation, and echo cancellation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recording device has impressive battery life. I went to a conference earlier this month with a fully charged device and recorded a few interviews and talks there. After that, I used the device for some phone call recording and personal note-taking. Despite all that use, the device still had 55% charge after 15 days. The company says you can wring 30 hours of continuous recording and 60 days of standby from a single charge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaud’s new device comes with a proprietary charger with a USB-C cable on the other end. The device takes two hours to charge from 0%, and then you are set for at least a couple of weeks unless you are recording hours of content.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3040223\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg 3841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Plaud</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One problem with wearable AI devices is that you have to ensure, through an indicator, that the device is recording (or has stopped recording). Thankfully, Plaud Note Pro has a tiny screen that displays your recording status. You can also press a button while recording to highlight a point a speaker is making, and it will show up in the AI-powered summary prominently. The screen also shows you the remaining battery level.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is intentionality behind recording with this device. You also get haptic feedback for starting and stopping the recording. The visual indication and your action of pressing the button also make it easier to signal to others in the meeting that you are recording the session.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077732\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg 5712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=768,531 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=1200,830 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=1280,885 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=430,297 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=720,498 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=900,622 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=800,553 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=1536,1062 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=2048,1416 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=668,462 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=542,375 542w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=892,617 892w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=708,489 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can choose to just record sessions and export them to another AI transcription service you are subscribed to.

The grid works best when it fades into the background. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid — and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources — moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Electricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/boom-supersonic-raises-300m-to-build-natural-gas-turbines-for-crusoe-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">repurposing supersonic jet engines</a> for data center duty and working on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/overview-energy-wants-to-beam-energy-from-space-to-existing-solar-farms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">beaming solar power down from space</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that pace of growth isn’t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">projected to nearly triple</a> in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consumer frustration</a> around pricing and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/environmental-groups-call-for-halt-to-new-data-center-construction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drawn the ire of environmental groups</a> that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/gridcare-thinks-more-than-100-gw-of-data-center-capacity-is-hiding-in-the-grid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gridcare</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/yottar-wants-to-help-energy-users-find-capacity-on-the-electrical-grid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yottar</a> argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber-optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amid the data center boom.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it’s needed most.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Base Power, for example, is building one in Texas by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/base-power-raises-1b-to-deploy-home-batteries-everywhere/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">leasing batteries to homeowners</a> at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn’t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other startups, including Texture, Uplight, and Camus, are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/texture-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developing software layers</a> to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&amp;D organization, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/nvidia-thinks-ai-can-solve-electrical-grid-problems-caused-by-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to develop industry-specific models</a> in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/google-thinks-ai-can-untangle-the-electrical-grids-bureaucracy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">working with the grid operator PJM</a> to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These changes won’t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Utilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they’re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it’s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Software, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances. It’s cheap, flexible, and speedy to deploy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/you-can-now-connect-your-spotify-account-to-chatgpt-heres-how-to-do-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify integration</a>, you can tell it to create personalized playlists that will show up right in your Spotify app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get started, make sure you’re logged into ChatGPT. Then type the name of the app you want to use at the start of your prompt, and ChatGPT will guide you through signing in and connecting your account.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you want to set everything up at once, head over to the Settings menu, then click on Apps and Connectors. You can browse through the available apps, pick the ones you like, and it’ll take you to the sign-in page for each one. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it’s important to note that connecting your account means you’re sharing your app data with ChatGPT. Make sure to review the permissions you’re giving when you’re linking your accounts. For example, if you connect your Spotify account, ChatGPT can see your playlists, listening history, and other personal information. (Sharing this info helps personalize the experience, but if you have privacy concerns, consider whether you’re comfortable with this level of access before connecting.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also disconnect any app whenever you want, right from the Settings menu.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-available-apps\">Available apps </h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3062079\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-booking-com\">Booking.com</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This integration with the online travel giant is designed to help travelers, especially first-time visitors in need of suggestions for where to stay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once you link your Booking.com account, you can ask ChatGPT to find hotels in your preferred city based on your dates and budget. You can also specify how many people are coming and whether you want the hotel near public transport. ChatGPT aims to make this process more intuitive than searching directly on the Booking.com site.

Whether it’s for a social media post, a poster, or a slide deck for a presentation, this may be a good way to help kickstart your project and brainstorm ideas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once you connect your Canva account, you can ask ChatGPT to design something like “a 16:9 slide deck about our Q4 roadmap” or “a fun poster for a dog-walking business.” You can include specifics such as the fonts you prefer, color schemes, formats (like Instagram posts or stories), and exact dimensions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-generated designs are seldom perfect, with occasional distorted images or spelling mistakes. However, some users may find this better than starting from scratch, and they can jump into Canva at any time to tweak their design and make it look just how they want.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-coursera\">Coursera</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Demo_Desktop_Oct6_V4-1.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3062078\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Coursera</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://blog.coursera.org/making-coursera-learning-more-accessible-worldwide-through-an-app-in-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Coursera’s integration</a> is designed to help you quickly discover the best online courses for your skill level.

Since then, optimists have regularly claimed that AI will become a critical part of the enterprise software industry, and so enterprise AI startups mushroomed on the back of immense amounts of investment.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But enterprises are still struggling to see the benefit of adopting these new AI tools. An <a href=\"https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MIT survey in August</a> found that 95% of enterprises weren’t getting a meaningful return on their investments in AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So when will businesses start seeing real benefits from using and integrating AI? TechCrunch surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs, and they overwhelmingly think 2026 will be the year when enterprises start to meaningfully adopt AI, see value from it, <em>and </em>increase their budgets for the tech.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprise VCs have been saying that for three years now. Will 2026 actually be different? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s hear what they have to say:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend:</strong> Enterprises are realizing that LLMs are not a silver bullet for most problems. Just because Starbucks can use Claude to write their own CRM software doesn’t mean they should. We’ll focus on custom models, fine tuning, evals, observability, orchestration, and data sovereignty.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Molly Alter, partner, Northzone:</strong> A subset of enterprise AI companies will shift from product businesses to AI consulting. These companies may start with a specific product, such as AI customer support or AI coding agents. But once they have enough customer workflows running off their platform, they can replicate the forward-deployed engineer model with their own team to build additional use cases for customers. In other words, many specialized AI product companies will become generalist AI implementers. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Marcie Vu, partner, Greycroft:</strong> We’re very excited about the opportunity in voice AI. Voice is a far more natural, efficient, and expressive way for people to communicate with each other and with machines. We’ve spent decades typing on computers and staring at screens, but speech is how we engage in the real world. I am eager to see how builders reimagine products, experiences, and interfaces with voice as the primary mode of interaction with intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner, Inspired Capital:</strong> 2026 will be the year AI reshapes the physical world — especially in infrastructure, manufacturing, and climate monitoring. We are moving from a reactive world to a predictive one, where physical systems can sense problems before they become failures.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners:</strong> We’re watching how frontier labs approach the application layer. A lot of people assumed labs would just train models and hand them off for others to build on, but that doesn’t seem to be how they are thinking about it. We may see frontier labs shipping more turnkey applications directly into production in domains like finance, law, healthcare, and education than people expect. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Tom Henriksson, general partner, OpenOcean:</strong> If I had to pick one word for quantum in 2026, it’s momentum. Trust in quantum advantage is building fast, with companies publishing roadmaps to demystify the tech. But don’t expect major software breakthroughs yet; we still need more hardware performance to cross that threshold.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-areas-are-you-looking-to-invest-in-nbsp\">Which areas are you looking to invest in? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Emily Zhao, principal, Salesforce Ventures:</strong> We are targeting two distinct frontiers — AI entering the physical world and the next evolution of model research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12:</strong> Future datacenter technology. For the last year or so, we’ve been standing up a few new investments that signal our interest in future “token factory” technology, with an eye towards what can really advance how efficiently and cleanly they run. This is going to continue in 2026 and beyond, in categories that include everything within the walls of the data center: cooling, compute, memory, and networking within and between sites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench:</strong> Vertical enterprise software where proprietary workflows and data create defensibility, particularly in regulated industries, supply chain, retail, and other complex operational environments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA:</strong> We are at the limit of humanity’s ability to generate enough energy to feed power-hungry GPUs. As an investor, I’m looking for software and hardware that can drive breakthroughs in performance per watt. This could be better GPU management, more efficient AI chips, next-gen networking approaches like optical, or rethinking thermal load within AI systems and data centers. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-when-it-comes-to-ai-startups-how-do-you-determine-that-a-company-has-a-moat-nbsp\">When it comes to AI startups, how do you determine that a company has a moat? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners:</strong> A moat in AI is less about the model itself and more about economics and integration. We look for companies that are deeply embedded in enterprise workflows, have access to proprietary or continuously improving data, and demonstrate defensibility through switching costs, cost advantages, or outcomes that are difficult to replicate.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: </strong>I’m skeptical of moats built purely on model performance or prompting — those advantages erode in months. The question I ask: If OpenAI or Anthropic launches a model tomorrow and is 10x better, does this company still have a reason to exist?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Molly Alter, partner, Northzone:</strong> It’s much easier today to build a moat in a vertical category rather than a horizontal one. The best moats are data moats, where each incremental customer, data point, or interaction makes the product better. These are somewhat easier to build in specialized categories like manufacturing, construction, health, or legal, where data is more consistent across customers. But there are also interesting “workflow moats,” where defensibility comes from understanding how a task or project moves from point A to point B in an industry.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Harsha Kapre, director, Snowflake Ventures:</strong> For AI startups, the strongest moat comes from how effectively they transform an enterprise’s existing data into better decisions, workflows, and customer experiences. Enterprises already sit on incredibly rich data; what they lack is the ability to reason over it in a targeted, trustworthy way. We look for startups that blend technical expertise with deep industry knowledge and can bring domain-specific solutions directly to a customer’s governed data, without creating new silos, to deliver insights or automation that weren’t previously possible.   </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-will-2026-be-the-year-when-enterprises-start-to-gain-value-from-ai-investments-nbsp\">Will 2026 be the year when enterprises start to gain value from AI investments? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend:</strong> Enterprises are realizing that random experiments with dozens of solutions create chaos. They will focus on fewer solutions with more thoughtful engagement.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures:</strong> The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces. In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Scott Beechuk, partner, Norwest Venture Partners:</strong> We’re definitely getting closer. If last year was about laying the infrastructure for AI, 2026 is when we begin to see whether the application layer can turn that investment into real value. As specialized models mature and oversight improves, AI systems are becoming more reliable in daily workflows.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital:</strong> Yes, but still incremental. There is still a lot of iteration, and AI is still improving to the point of being able to showcase pain-point solutions for enterprises across a variety of industries. I believe solving simulation to reality training will likely open up many opportunities for a selection of industries, both existing and nascent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz:</strong> There have been sensational headlines this year about enterprises not seeing returns on their AI investments. Ask any software engineer if they would ever want to go back to the dark ages before they had AI coding tools. Unlikely. My point is, enterprises are already gaining value this year, and it will multiply across organizations next year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-think-enterprises-will-increase-their-ai-budgets-in-2026-nbsp\">Do you think enterprises will increase their AI budgets in 2026? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire:</strong> Yes, I believe they will, though it’s nuanced. Rather than simply increasing AI budgets, organizations will shift portions of their labor spend toward AI technologies or generate such strong top-line ROI from AI capabilities that the investment effectively pays for itself three to five times over. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners:</strong> Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results and will decline sharply for everything else. Overall spend may grow, but it will be significantly more concentrated. We expect a bifurcation, where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Gordon Ritter, founder and general partner, Emergence Capital:</strong> Yes, but spend will concentrate. Enterprises will increase budgets where AI expands on institutional advantages, and pull back from tools that simply automate workflows without capturing (and securing!) proprietary intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures:</strong> 2026 will be the year that CIOs push back on AI vendor sprawl. Today, enterprises are testing out multiple tools for a single use case — monthly spend and switching costs are low in many cases, so the incentive to experiment is there — and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts]. As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools, and deploy those savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ryan Isono, managing director, Maverick Ventures:</strong> In aggregate, yes, and there will be some shifting from pilots/experimental budgets to budgeted line items. A boon for AI startups in 2026 will be the transition of enterprises who tried to build in-house solutions and have now realized the difficulty and complexity required in production at scale.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-it-take-to-raise-a-series-a-as-an-enterprise-focused-ai-startup-in-2026-nbsp\">What does it take to raise a Series A as an enterprise-focused AI startup in 2026? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital:</strong> The best companies right now combine two things: a compelling “why now” narrative — usually tied to GenAI creating new attack surfaces, infrastructure needs, or workflow opportunities — and concrete proof of enterprise adoption. One million dollars to $2 million [annual recurring revenue] is the baseline, but what matters more than that is whether customers view you and your product as mission-critical to their business versus just being a nice-to-have. Revenue without narrative is a feature; narrative without traction is vaporware. You need both. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners:</strong> You should aim to show you’re building in a space where the [total addressable market] expands rather than evaporates as AI drives down costs. Some markets have high elasticity of demand — a 90% price decline leads to a 10x increase in market size. Others have low elasticity, where dropping the price can vaporize the market, so the customers keep all of the value being created. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench:</strong> Customers are using the product in real, day-to-day operations and are willing to take reference calls and talk honestly about impact, reliability, and buying process, etc. Companies should be able to clearly show how the product saves time, reduces cost, or increases output in a way that holds up through security, legal, and procurement reviews. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12:</strong> We (investors) were casting a doubtful eye towards [estimated annual recurring revenue] or pilot revenue until recently. Now it’s not seen as much of an asterisk as much as the customer’s interest and willingness to evaluate a solution in the face of so many options pushed their way. Getting those engagements and customer buy-in in terms of running an evaluation isn’t just a matter of forward-deployed engineers making it easier for the customer. It takes quality and a winning marketing message to do it in 2026. Investors are expecting to see conversions become the leading part of the story after six months of pilot use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital:</strong> Execution and traction. The best signal is users genuinely delighted to use the product and the technical sophistication of the business. We look at a huge north star of real contractual agreements, 12+ months. In addition to that, was this founder able to attract top-tier talent to join their startup over competitors or the traditional hyper-scalers?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-role-will-ai-agents-play-at-enterprises-by-the-end-of-2026-nbsp\">What role will AI agents play at enterprises by the end of 2026? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Nnamdi Okike, managing partner and co-founder, 645 Ventures:</strong> Agents will still be in their initial adoption phase by the end of 2026. There are many technical and compliance hurdles that need to be overcome for enterprises to truly benefit from AI agents. There also need to be standards created for agent-to-agent communication. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire:</strong> One universal agent will emerge. Today, each agent is siloed in its role — for example, inbound [sales development representative], outbound SDR, customer support, product discovery, etc. But by late next year, we’ll start to see these roles converge into a single agent with shared context and memory, breaking down long-standing organizational silos, and enabling a more unified, contextual conversation between companies and their users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures:</strong> The winners will be organizations that figure out the right balance of autonomy and oversight quickly and that recognize agent deployment as collaborative augmentation rather than a clean division of labor. Rather than agents handling all routine work while humans do all the thinking, we’ll see more sophisticated collaboration between humans and agents on complex tasks, with the boundary between their roles continuously evolving. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA:</strong> The majority of knowledge workers will have at least one agentic co-worker they know by name! </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Eric Bahn, co-founder, general partner, Hustle Fund:</strong> I think that AI agents will probably be the bigger part of the workforce than any humans in enterprises. Proliferating AI agents is essentially free and zero marginal cost. So why not grow through bots? </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-kinds-of-companies-in-your-portfolio-are-seeing-the-strongest-growth-nbsp\">What kinds of companies in your portfolio are seeing the strongest growth? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital:</strong> The companies growing fastest are the ones that identified a workflow or security gap created by GenAI adoption, then executed relentlessly on product-market fit. In cybersecurity, it’s tools addressing data security so LLMs can interact with sensitive data safely, and agent governance ensuring autonomous systems have appropriate controls. In marketing, it’s new areas like Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — getting discovered in AI responses, not just search results. The common thread: These weren’t categories two years ago but are now must-haves for enterprises deploying AI at scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures:</strong> We’re seeing growth tied to a few common themes. One is companies that land with focused use cases — companies that start with a narrower wedge (could be a focused target persona or use case), really nail it, become sticky and earn the right to expand from the initial wedge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz:</strong> Companies that help enterprises put AI into production are doing well. Areas like data extraction and structuring, developer productivity for AI systems, infrastructure for generative media, voice and audio for media, and apps like support or call centers. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-kinds-of-companies-are-seeing-the-strongest-retention-nbsp\">What kinds of companies are seeing the strongest retention? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital:</strong> Companies with retention and expansion share a pattern — they solve problems that intensify as customers deploy more AI. Strong retention comes from three things: being mission-critical (removal breaks production workflows), accumulating proprietary context that’s hard to re-create, and solving problems that grow with AI adoption rather than being one-and-done. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Tom Henriksson, general partner, OpenOcean:</strong> Retention is trickier to measure for younger companies, but the highest retention we’re seeing is in the serious enterprise software providers, especially those enhanced with AI. A good example is <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/KiOXC93z2zCxkYp1u1ujFqkGSr?domain=openocean.vc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Operations1</a>, which digitizes employee-led production processes end-to-end. These companies go deep into the customer’s organization, transform how they operate, and build up proprietary data and knowledge that makes them very hard to do without. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12:</strong> Startups serving the enterprise in data tooling and vertical AI apps, with forward-deployed teams assisting in customer satisfaction, quality, and product improvement. This seems to be the winning formula that has been adopted by all leading startups in those markets. Longer term, the embedded teams might recede as the customers start to internalize the use of AI in their organizations and workday practices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench:</strong> Retention is highest where software becomes foundational infrastructure rather than a point solution. AuthZed has strong retention because authorization and policy sit at the core of modern systems and are extremely costly to rip out once embedded. Courier Health and GovWell act as systems of record and orchestration layers for end-to-end workflows, patient journeys in healthcare, and permitting in government, which makes them deeply embedded once live.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Still, he was shocked that he received a notification on his own phone. He called his father, turned off and put his phone away, and went to buy a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was panicking,” he told TechCrunch. “It was a mess. It was a huge mess.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gibson is just one of an ever-increasing number of people who are receiving notifications from companies like Apple, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2017/03/reassuring-our-users-about-government.html\">Google</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/641700318302674\">WhatsApp</a>, all of which send similar warnings about spyware attacks to their users. Tech companies are increasingly proactive in alerting their users when they become targets of government hackers, and in particular those who use spyware made by companies such as Intellexa, NSO Group, and Paragon Solutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while Apple, Google, and WhatsApp alert, they don’t get involved in what happens next. The tech companies direct their users to people who could help, at which point the companies step away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is what happens when you receive one of these warnings. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-warning-nbsp\">Warning </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You have received a notification that you were the target of government hackers. Now what? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First of all, take it seriously. These companies have reams of telemetry data about their users and what happens on both their devices and their online accounts. These tech giants have security teams that have been hunting, studying, and analyzing this type of malicious activity for years. If they think you have been targeted, they are probably right. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s important to note that in the case of Apple and WhatsApp notifications, receiving one doesn’t mean you were necessarily hacked. It’s possible that the hacking attempt failed, but they can still tell you that someone tried. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078805\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A photo showing the text of a threat notification sent by Apple to a suspected spyware victim.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Omar Marques / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of Google, it’s most likely that the company blocked the attack and is telling you so you can go into your account and make sure you have multi-factor authentication on (ideally a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-security-keys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">physical security key</a> or passkey), and also turn on its <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/intl/en_in/advancedprotection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Advanced Protection Program</a>, which also requires a security key and adds other layers of security to your Google account.

You can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mobile Verification Toolkit</a>, or MVT, a tool that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lets you look for forensic traces of an attack</a> on your own, perhaps as a first step before looking for assistance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you don’t want or can’t use MVT, you can go straight to someone who can help. If you are a journalist, dissident, academic, or human rights activist, there are a handful of organizations that can help. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can turn to <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/help/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Access Now and its Digital Security Helpline</a>. You can also contact Amnesty International, which has <a href=\"https://securitylab.amnesty.org/get-help/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its own team of investigators</a> and ample experience in these cases. Or, you can reach out to <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Citizen Lab</a>, a digital rights group at the University of Toronto, which has been investigating spyware abuses for almost 15 years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you are a journalist, <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/digital-security-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reporters Without Borders</a> also has a digital security lab that offers to investigate suspected cases of hacking and surveillance. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of these categories of people, politicians or business executives, for example, will have to go elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you work for a large company or political party, you likely have a competent (hopefully!) security team you can go straight to. They may not have the specific knowledge to investigate in depth, but in that case they probably know who to turn to, even if Access Now, Amnesty, and Citizen Lab cannot help those outside of civil society. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Otherwise, there aren’t many places executives or politicians you can turn to, but we have asked around and found the ones below. We can’t fully vouch for any of these organizations, nor do we endorse them directly, but based on suggestions from people we trust, it’s worth pointing them out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the most well known of these private security companies is <a href=\"https://iverify.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iVerify</a>, which makes an app for Android and iOS, and gives users an option to ask for an in-depth forensic investigation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Matt Mitchell, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/matt-mitchell-is-arming-underserved-communities-with-anti-surveillance-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a well-regarded security expert</a> who’s been helping vulnerable populations protect themselves from surveillance, has a new startup called <a href=\"http://safetysyncgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Safety Sync Group</a>, which offers this kind of service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jessica Hyde, a forensic investigator with experience in the public and private sectors, has her own startup called <a href=\"https://www.hexordia.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hexordia</a>, and offers to investigate suspected hacks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mobile cybersecurity company Lookout, which has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/spyware-maker-caught-distributing-malicious-android-apps-for-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">experience</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/north-korean-government-hackers-snuck-spyware-on-android-app-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">analyzing</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/17/hermit-spyware-government/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">government</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/researchers-uncover-chinese-spyware-used-to-target-android-devices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spyware</a> from around the world, <a href=\"https://www.lookout.com/form/report-mobile-incident\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has an online form</a> that allows people to reach out for help to investigate cyberattacks involving malware, device compromise, and more. The company’s threat intelligence and forensics teams may then get involved.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s Costin Raiu, who heads <a href=\"https://tlpblack.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TLPBLACK</a>, a small team of security researchers who used to work at Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Group, or GReAT. Raiu was the unit’s head when his team discovered sophisticated cyberattacks from elite government hacking teams from the United States, Russia, Iran, and other countries. Raiu told TechCrunch that people who suspect they’ve been hacked can <a href=\"mailto:costin@tlpblack.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">email him</a> directly.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Investigation</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What happens next depends on who you go to for help. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Generally speaking, the organization you reach out to may want to do an initial forensic check by looking at a diagnostic report file that you can create on your device, which you can share with the investigators remotely. At this point, this doesn’t require you to hand over your device to anyone. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This first step may be able to detect signs of targeting or even infection. It may also turn out nothing. In both cases, the investigators may want to dig deeper, which will require you to send in a full backup of your device, or even your actual device. At that point, the investigators will do their work, which may take time because modern government spyware attempts to hide and delete its tracks, and will tell you what happened. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately, modern spyware may not leave any traces. The modus operandi these days, according to Hassan Selmi, who leads the incident response team at Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline, is a “smash and grab” strategy, meaning that once spyware infects the target device, it steals as much data as it can and then tries to remove any trace and uninstall itself. This is assumed as the spyware makers trying to protect their product and hide its activity from investigators and researchers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you are a journalist, a dissident, an academic, or a human rights activist, the groups who help you may ask if you want to publicize that you were attacked, but you’re not required to do so. They will be happy to help you without taking public credit for it. There may be good reasons to come out, though: to denounce the fact that a government targeted you, which may have the side effect of warning others like you of the dangers of spyware; or to expose a spyware company by showing that their customers are abusing their technology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We hope you never get one of these notifications. But we also hope that, if you do, you find this guide useful. Stay safe out there.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Kevin Hartz’s security system failed to alert him as an intruder rang his doorbell and tried to enter his San Francisco home late one night, the serial entrepreneur decided existing solutions weren’t good enough. His co-founder Jack Abraham had experienced similar frustrations at his Miami Beach residence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, they launched <a href=\"https://www.sauron.systems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sauron</a> — named after the sinister, all-seeing eye from “The Lord of the Rings” — to build what they envisioned as a military-grade home security system for tech elites. The concept resonated in Bay Area circles, where crime had become a constant topic during and after the pandemic, despite San Francisco Police Department statistics showing property crime and homicide rates declining last year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup raised $18 million from executives behind Flock Safety and Palantir; defense tech investors, including 8VC; Abraham’s startup lab Atomic; and Hartz’s investment firm A*. It came out of stealth exactly a year ago, promising to launch in the first quarter of 2025 with a system combining AI-driven intelligence, advanced sensors like LiDAR and thermal imaging, and 24/7 human monitoring by former military and law enforcement personnel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a year later, Sauron is still very much in development mode —  a reality that its new CEO, Maxime “Max” Bouvat-Merlin, acknowledged candidly in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After nearly nine years at Sonos, including a stint as chief product officer, Bouvat-Merlin took the helm of Sauron just last month. He’s spending his first days on the job finalizing fundamental questions: which sensors to use, how exactly the deterrence system will work, and when the company can realistically get products into customers’ homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The answer to that last question? Later in 2026 at the earliest — a significant delay from the original timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in the development phase,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “You’ll see a phased approach where we get our solution to market as a stepping stone. All the different components — our concierge service, our AI software running on servers, our smart cameras — are building blocks coming together in a plan we just put in place very recently.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Bouvat-Merlin sees striking parallels between Sauron and Sonos, which both target wealthy customers first, rely on word-of-mouth growth, and combine complex hardware with sophisticated software. “I had lunch with John MacFarlane, the founder of Sonos, a few weeks ago,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “All the topics he was thinking about when starting Sonos were exactly the same topics we’re discussing at Sauron.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both companies faced the same strategic questions: Start with super-premium customers or mass premium? Professional installation or DIY? Build everything in-house or partner with an ecosystem? “We might make different decisions, but the questions are very similar,” he said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-security-problem\">The security problem </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bouvat-Merlin says he was drawn to Sauron by both the mission and an opportunity to solve a real customer problem. “Securing people’s homes is important, but I also like the deterrence aspect — changing people’s minds before they make a bad decision and get into trouble,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His research showed that market leaders in premium home security have small market shares and negative Net Promoter Scores. “People are not happy with their solutions today,” he said. “There are so many false positives that when law enforcement is called, they don’t respond because they assume it’s a false alarm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is targeting customers “where safety and security is a major concern”  —  people like Hartz. The plan is to start with this premium segment, establish a reputation for supporting demanding clients, then expand to what Bouvat-Merlin calls “mass premium.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-product-that-s-still-taking-shape\">The product (that’s still taking shape)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So what exactly is Sauron building? The answer is still evolving. The offering starts with camera pods containing multiple sensors —  “40 cameras and different types of sensors, potentially LiDAR and radar, potentially thermal,” Bouvat-Merlin said. These pods connect to servers running machine learning software for computer vision, all linked to a 24/7 concierge service staffed by former military and law enforcement personnel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Those people understand patterns,” he said. “They’re good at helping us mature our machine learning solution and train our system to detect weird behaviors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deterrence system remains somewhat vague. Options being considered include loudspeakers, flashing lights, and other methods. But Bouvat-Merlin emphasized that deterrence should begin before someone enters a property, detecting when homes are being surveilled, noticing cars circling neighborhoods multiple times, and identifying threats at each stage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The more upfront we are with deterrence, the more we can convince people this is the wrong house to rob and the wrong decision to make,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the drones mentioned when Sauron first took the wraps off its plans last year, Bouvat-Merlin declined to say much. “These are roadmap conversations. I don’t want to go too deep at this point because there are so many things we could do, but we’re such a small company,” he said. He added that, bigger picture, the focus is on growing the ecosystem through partnerships rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-timeline-and-business-model\">Timeline and business model</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With fewer than 40 employees, Sauron plans to hire just 10 to 12 more in 2026. The company will also begin working with early adopters later in 2026, with a Series A fundraise planned for mid-year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Raising a Series A is not about raising because we have to — it’s because we want to,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “I want to make sure we’re showing progress and explaining how we’ll use extra funds to accelerate growth, [including to] launch our first end-to-end product, drive customer adoption, and accelerate the roadmap.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has already attracted a significant list of prospective clients, he said, thanks to work by Sauron’s three founders, which include roboticist and engineer <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasumathi-raman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vasumathi Raman</a>. “We expect the strategy initially to be word of mouth, then grow differently over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Bouvat-Merlin is cautious about growth. “I want to make sure we grow sustainably and keep the experience and service premium over time,” he said. “I want to manage growing pains as much as possible while driving profitability.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-surveillance-state-question\">The surveillance state question</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Facial recognition and privacy concerns loom large for a surveillance-heavy product. Bouvat-Merlin outlined one approach: a trust-based system where homeowners grant access to specific people. “I granted you access to my house, so now you’re in the trusted group. When you come, I detect it’s you and you’re allowed in. Everyone else is an unknown person,” he said, painting a picture of a likely scenario.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">License plate detection is also being considered for identifying cars circling neighborhoods multiple times. “How do we assess if that’s a threat? The ex-military and ex-law enforcement team will be really good at helping mature our machine learning solution,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, Bouvat-Merlin is confident in the opportunity ahead because of Sauron’s approach. “A lot of companies started as traditional security companies and are trying to add tech,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’re looking at it from the opposite angle — we’re a tech startup in San Francisco bringing technology to this market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sauron is also appearing on the scene as concerns rise about crime among the most wealthy. Recent high-profile incidents include a November armed robbery at the home of tech investors Lachy Groom and Joshua Buckley in San Francisco’s Mission District, where $11 million in cryptocurrency was stolen during a 90-minute ordeal involving torture and threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We see people who are wealthy attracting criminals,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’ve seen a lot of robberies in San Francisco and other major U.S. cities, sometimes at gunpoint. I don’t think the world is getting safer — there are probably more disparities between people at the top and bottom of the wealth spectrum. We see anxiety from prospective clients who are eager to get their homes secured.”<br><br>Still, much remains uncertain about Sauron’s path. The company must finalize everything from sensor configurations to manufacturing locations. (Bouvat-Merlin mentioned potentially starting in the U.S. for proximity and control, then moving to more affordable locations as volume grows.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It must also determine how to serve customers in different settings,  from estates with perimeters to dense urban residences, while maintaining premium service quality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Bouvat-Merlin says he’s focused on listening to his team, building credibility, and finalizing the strategy he’s putting in place. “I don’t demand that people trust me  — I want to show them why they should.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company expects to share more details about its products later next year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047856\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png 3280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1200,539 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1280,574 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=2048,919 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=668,300 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1375,617 1375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=708,318 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need. </p>\n\n<p

Dutch entrepreneur <a href=\"https://nalden.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nalden</a>, who co-founded the platform in 2009, says he’s deeply unhappy with changes made since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bending-spoons-acquires-file-transfer-service-wetransfer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bending Spoons</a> — a Milan-based tech firm known for buying and restructuring popular apps — acquired the service last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bending Spoons doesn’t really care about people. Even though I get that it is their private equity strategy, I notice that since I left [WeTransfer] in 2019, there were a lot of updates that were basically killing the product, in my point of view,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the acquisition, WeTransfer, which now has over 70 million monthly active users, made unclear changes to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/21/wetransfers-expiry-dates-havent-gone-away-but-you-can-at-least-extend-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how transfer links work</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/bending-spoons-plans-to-lay-off-75-of-wetransfer-staff-after-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">laid off 75% of its staff</a>. This year, the company sparked controversy over employing its users’ content to train AI models and had to <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/wetransfer-backtracks-on-ai-file-training-after-backlash-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">backtrack on changes to its terms</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon after, Nalden says creatives began reaching out to share their frustration with WeTransfer. He realized he wanted to build an alternative to WeTransfer that recaptured the original ethos of the service around simplicity. That service is called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bmrng.me\">Boomerang</a>, and users can transfer files without logging in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Why do tech companies always make things so complicated? I’ve always struggled with this, and I just wanted to offer another tool that [is entirely focused on the] user experience, its ease of use. It’s the simplicity of sharing something quickly and that just saves time. You don’t need to sign up, you don’t need to verify via email,” Nalden told TechCrunch of the service.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078475\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg 2744w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=768,623 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=680,552 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=1200,973 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=1280,1038 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=430,349 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=720,584 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=900,730 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=800,649 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=1536,1246 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=2048,1661 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=668,542 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=462,375 462w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=761,617 761w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=655,531 655w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-23.04.42.jpeg?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Boomerang</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For casual users, the non-login experience should be sufficient, though it has its limits — 1GB of total storage and a 1GB file size limit with a seven-day expiration.

The startup is focused on essentially one task: preventing damaging water leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers use a lot of water, and that water can present a big risk, even if a leak is small. Founder John Khazraee told TechCrunch that many data centers only have reactive solutions for water leaks. That can saddle companies with downtime and set them back millions of dollars if one occurs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee would know. He spent more than 15 years building infrastructure for IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. With MayimFlow, he’s developed a combination of IoT sensors and edge-deployed machine learning models that can detect signs of impending leaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve noticed these issues in data centers, and the only solution they had was: ‘When the leak happens, we find out,’” he said in an interview. “Now you have to spend a lot of money to go remediate the situation. Now you got to turn off the servers. Now the data is being disrupted. So I decided to do something about it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee assembled a small team with plenty of experience to take on this challenge. Jim Wong, MayimFlow’s chief strategy officer, has spent decades working with data centers. Chief technology officer Ray Lok has carved out a career in water management and IoT infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the scariest consequences of unnoticed water leaks, there’s an element of frugality to what Khazraee is trying to do with MayimFlow, which he said comes from his childhood.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I grew up in a very, you know, I don’t want to say the word ‘poor’ family, but we weren’t the most well-off family,” he said. “And my dad would always, when I was taking a shower, tell me, ‘Hey, you’re in the shower too long. Are you singing in there?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As he grew up, Khazraee said he found himself always thinking about how to make things more efficient — especially as he studied to become an engineer. In college, he worked at a facility that collected frying oil from restaurants and converted it to biodiesel. It was a “messy job,” he said, but he liked the end result. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee is now trying to mix this penchant for frugality with the experience of his team. He believes they can give data center operators 24 to 48 hours of advanced warning that repairs will be needed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MayimFlow has collected a glut of sample data from various industrial water systems that allow them to make these kinds of predictions, he said. The company can provide sensors that can help monitor a water system or plug its machine learning models into existing ones if companies already have similar hardware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee said he wants to bring this solution beyond data centers to commercial buildings, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, and possibly even utilities. In his eyes, any company that wants to spot leaks early, or optimize water usage, could be a customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee thinks it’s such a big opportunity he’s turned down roles at multiple Big Tech companies while building MayimFlow over the last two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really believe in the vision. I believe in the impact that we’re making,” he said. “Water is becoming one of those big issues in our world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

I didn’t opt for an Apple Watch because I wasn’t constantly active, I didn’t feel the need to check my notifications, and I didn’t want to think about charging the watch every day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, I got a chance to test the new Google Pixel Watch 4, which made me feel like I might start wearing smartwatches again. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have always had a soft spot for circular watches. One of the first smartwatches I owned was the Moto 360, and I loved its rounded design.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel Watch 4 has a curved domed Actua 360 display with thinner bezels as compared to last year’s watch. I have the 41 mm watch as the test unit, but I would personally opt for the 45 mm size for battery and a bigger display. The display is also brighter with 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and that makes it easier to use in daylight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The battery life is great on the Pixel Watch 4, even with the smaller size. I have managed to get more than a day’s use out of the watch on those days when I have lighter activities.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078508\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the Pixel Watch 4 has a proprietary charger where you can place the watch on the cradle like a puck, the charging speed makes up for it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google advertises that you can charge this watch from 0% to 50% in 15 minutes and from 0% to 100% in 45 minutes. While the real-life timing doesn’t exactly match these numbers, I saw charging times that came close to these figures. The advantage of this rapid charging is that you can always put your watch to charge when you are making a coffee or doing a quick chore within the house, and get enough juice to last you throughout the day.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fitness-and-software\">Fitness and software</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I largely used the Google Pixel Watch 4 to track my pickleball sessions and walking. Apart from calorie burns, there were no particular insights into sports-related movement. For the last 15 days, I started going to a gym, and apart from the treadmill and elliptical mode, there aren’t any specialized modes for particular gym equipment. Instead, you have to select from options for things like core training, weights, or a general workout mode, based on the workout you are doing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The watch does have more features for someone who runs — but that’s not possible in Delhi weather with terrible AQI right now. It also detects cardio workouts after 15 minutes of continuous activities, but while walking, these have been hit or miss for me. Another measure that has been off for me has been floor count. On days I’ve walked to a cafe, I’ve seen a very high count for that, and on days I have gone up to my terrace multiple times, the number of floors climbed is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I am not someone who used to wear my watch or band to sleep. With the Pixel Watch 4, I had to mentally train myself to keep the watch on so I could get a better understanding of sleep and readiness scores. After a few weeks of usage, I regularly wore my watch to sleep. However, you don’t get additional or actionable insights related to sleep or readiness score on the watch in the daily summary. You do get suggestions on the Fitbit app related to readiness, but that’s about it. With fitness apps adding more AI to their apps, Google needs to step up its game.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?w=311\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078520\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=137,300 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=768,1681 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=311,680 311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=548,1200 548w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=585,1280 585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=196,430 196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=329,720 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=411,900 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=702,1536 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=936,2048 936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=305,668 305w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=171,375 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=282,617 282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=243,531 243w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s new Material UI design for the watch is refreshing and matches the theme on my Pixel Fold. The weather app is very nice to look at for both hourly and day forecasts. My one gripe is that I wish the exercise app allowed for more than three kinds of workouts to be available through quick start. I could raise my watch to talk to Gemini, which is neat, but beyond starting timers, asking for occasional sports updates, and starting a workout, I have not needed Gemini to be ever-present for me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have been a fan of the recent Pixel Watch 4 update that lets me use the pinch gesture to dismiss notifications, play or pause videos or music, or even move my wrist to dismiss calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The gripes I had about the watch didn’t bother me in daily usage. The display is fantastic, the software and fitness experience overall are great, and the display, along with the new design, is an upgrade from the last generation. However, the thing that drew me the most to the watch and made me stick to it is the combo of battery life and fast charging. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All in all, the Pixel Watch 4 is one of the best Android smartwatches around.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
