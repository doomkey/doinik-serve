The app, called <a href=\"https://www.zesty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Zesty</a>, is initially available in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the app, DoorDash is branching out beyond food delivery and stepping into the social and discovery space. The idea behind the app is to get rid of the need to read a bunch of different reviews, look up different menus, or browse TikTok when looking for a new place to eat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once people open the app and sign in with their DoorDash accounts, they can ask an AI chatbot for personalized recommendations based on what they’re looking for. In an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zestyapp/reel/DSS6wVSD5eE/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Instagram promo post</a>, the company shared that users can type prompts like, “A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that’s actually good for introverts” to find specific recommendations. Users will also see suggested prompts, such as “Brunch spots good for groups,” and “Romantic dinner with a vintage feel.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang wrote in an <a href=\"https://x.com/andyfang/status/2000728321739645236\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">X post</a> that the app aggregates info across DoorDash, Google Maps, TikTok, and more to “curate the best suggestions from the web.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076579\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg 3960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=1200,869 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=1280,927 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=430,311 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=720,521 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=900,652 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=800,579 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=1536,1112 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=2048,1483 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=668,484 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=518,375 518w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=852,617 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=708,513 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Zesty</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app also learns your tastes to figure out what you do and don’t like. Once you come across a recommendation you’re interested in, you can save it and share it with others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can view and share photos and comments about restaurants they’ve visited, discover content from others, and follow people just like on any social network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At DoorDash, we’re always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,” a DoorDash spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. “We’re piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. We’re excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News of the app’s launch was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/doordash-launches-zesty-an-ai-powered-app-for-finding-new-restaurants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, some people may not want to download a whole new app to find new restaurants when they could simply use Google. For people who have already embedded AI into their daily lives, they may already be using services like ChatGPT and Gemini to discover new restaurants. However, the app could be a welcome launch for people who want to be part of a social network that’s all about discovering new restaurants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch of the new app marks DoorDash’s latest effort to branch beyond delivery services, as the company earlier this year launched features that allow customers to <a href=\"https://about.doordash.com/en-us/news/doordash-launches-going-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">make reservations for in-person dining</a> and earn in-store rewards. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature will initially become available on Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the U.S. and Canada, the company says. In addition, the glasses are getting another update that lets you use Spotify to play a song that matches what’s in your current view.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if you’re looking at an album cover, the glasses could play a song by that artist. Or if you’re looking at your Christmas tree with a pile of gifts, you could play holiday music. This addition is more of a gimmick, of course, but it demonstrates how Meta is thinking about connecting what people see with actions they can take in their apps.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conversation-focus feature, meanwhile, seems more practical. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/meta-connect-2025-what-to-expect-and-how-to-watch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">First announced at Meta’s Connect conference</a> earlier this year, the feature uses the AI glasses’ open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to. Meta says smart glasses wearers will also be able to adjust the amplification level by swiping the right temple of their glasses, or via the device settings. This will allow them to set the level more precisely to match their current environment, whether that’s a busy restaurant or bar, club, commuter train, or anything else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How well the feature works, of course, will still need to be tested. However, the idea of using smart accessories as tools to help with hearing isn’t limited to Meta. Apple’s AirPods already offer a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/airpods/use-and-customize-transparency-mode-dev966f5f818/web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Conversation Boost feature</a> designed to help you focus on the person you’re talking to, and the Pro models more recently added support for a<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/120992\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the conversation-focus feature is limited to the U.S. and Canada, the Spotify feature is offered in English in a larger number of markets, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the U.K., and the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software update (v21) will first become available to those who are enrolled in Meta’s Early Access Program, which requires first joining a <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/early-access-program/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">waitlist</a> and being approved. It will later roll out more broadly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s the latest escalation in the competition with Google’s Gemini after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month declared a “code red” in a leaked internal memo. The memo detailed OpenAI’s plans to regain its position as the AI leader after Google had begun to take market share following the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\">release of Gemini 3</a>, its latest flagship model, and Nano Banana Pro, the newest version of Google’s viral image generator — both of which have topped the <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LMArena leaderboard</a> across multiple benchmarks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google maintains its lead even after OpenAI responded to its success last week with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/openai-fires-back-at-google-with-gpt-5-2-after-code-red-memo/\">launch of GPT-5.2</a>, pitching it as its most advanced model yet for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/openai-boasts-enterprise-win-days-after-internal-code-red-on-google-threat/?_thumbnail_id=3073655\">developers and everyday professional use</a>. OpenAI had reportedly been planning to release a new image generator in early January, accelerating those plans with this week’s announcement. Its last image model release was GPT Image 1 in April. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT Image 1.5 arrives as image and video generators advance beyond prototypes and gain more production-ready capabilities. Like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/google-releases-nano-banana-pro-its-latest-image-generation-model/\">Nano Banana Pro</a>, ChatGPT Image offers post-production features, providing more granular edit controls to maintain visual consistency, like facial likeness, lighting, composition, and color tone across edits. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076523\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The same image depicted above with different edits to showcase GPT Image 1.5’s improved instruction-following</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most GenAI image tools are bad at iteration, so this would be a huge step up. Asked for a specific change, like “adjust the facial expression” or “make lighting colder,” models will often reinterpret the entire image, leading to a lack of consistency. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The update isn’t just about new features. ChatGPT images will also now be accessible via a dedicated entry point in the ChatGPT sidebar that works “more like a creative studio,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, <a href=\"https://fidjisimo.substack.com/p/more-dynamic-ai-experiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in a blog post Tuesday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The new image viewing and editing screens make it easier to create images that match your vision or get inspiration from trending prompts and preset filters,” Simo wrote.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of the new image generator, OpenAI is introducing new ways to improve the ChatGPT experience with more visual elements. The plan is to make search queries display more visuals with clear sources, which could be helpful for tasks like converting measurements or checking sports scores, per Simo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you’re creating, you should be able to see and shape the thing you’re making. When visuals tell a story better than words alone, ChatGPT should include them,” Simo wrote. “When you need a quick answer or the next step lives in another tool, it should be right there. As we do this, we can keep closing the distance between what’s in your mind and your ability to bring it to life.”</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After going public during the pandemic and scoring a key deal with Volvo, the company had added Mercedes-Benz and Polestar as customers of its “<a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/48/luminar-ceo-says-volvo-ex90-defines-a-new-era-of-safety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lifesaving</a>” lidar sensors. Founder and CEO Austin Russell <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/59/luminar-achieves-new-wins-expands-roadmap-at-ces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called it</a> an “inflection point,” as Luminar prepped to have those sensors integrated into the first production vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Volvo in particular was all in on the technology. The Swedish automaker, which spent decades building a brand around the idea of making the safest cars, was the first to jump at integrating the laser-based sensors in its vehicles. Volvo initially tapped Luminar to provide 39,500 lidar sensors over the life of a deal signed in 2020. In 2021, Volvo upped that to 673,000. And in 2022, Volvo upped it again, this time to 1.1 million sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three years later, Luminar is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">now in bankruptcy</a>. The company has already <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/111/luminar-announces-sale-of-photonics-business-to-quantum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">made a deal</a> to sell off one subsidiary centered around semiconductors and is looking to sell its lidar business during the Chapter 11 process, which began on Monday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first batch of filings in the bankruptcy case shed new light on how Luminar’s cornerstone deal with Volvo came apart — and how its undoing helped push the once-promising startup over the edge.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-big-promises-then-big-revisions\">Big promises, then big revisions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar made “substantial up-front investments in equipment, facilities, and workforce” to meet the demand from Volvo back in 2022, according to a <a href=\"https://casedocs.omniagentsolutions.com/cmsvol2/pub_47582/372fc06a-000d-40d8-9eec-521770a9a89f_20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declaration</a> written by Luminar’s newly hired chief restructuring officer Robin Chiu. It built out <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/66/luminar-announces-new-automated-high-volume-factory-begins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico</a>, and spent nearly $200 million to prepare to make its Iris lidar sensors for Volvo’s EX90 SUV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, according to Chiu, problems were already brewing with Volvo. The automaker delayed the EX90 SUV because it needed to do more “software testing and development,” the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/11/23719686/volvo-ex90-delay-software-production-luminar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">automaker said in 2023</a>. And in early 2024, Luminar says Volvo reduced its expected volume for Iris sensors by 75%. (Volvo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar’s other deals started to sour, too. Polestar (a subsidiary of Volvo) quietly gave up on integrating Luminar’s lidar sensors “because the vehicle’s software ultimately could not use” the features, according to Chiu. Mercedes-Benz terminated its agreement to buy Luminar’s Iris sensors in November 2024 because the lidar-maker “failed to meet ambitious requirements,” according to Chiu. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Mercedes-Benz struck up a new deal with Luminar in March 2025 for its next-generation Halo lidar, but Chiu wrote that Luminar has “no go-forward projects” with the German automaker at the time of bankruptcy.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This left Luminar with Volvo as its lone flagship customer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company never diversified much beyond the automotive industry, shunning other applications like defense or robotics. In fact, Russell had founded Luminar in 2012 with the goal of taking lidar out of those sectors and into automotive to help accelerate the adoption of autonomous vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It wasn’t until March of this year that Russell talked about expanding beyond automotive, as Luminar signed <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-03-27/lidar-maker-luminar-inks-deal-with-caterpillar-video\">a deal with construction equipment company Caterpillar</a>. Just two months later, Russell <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/billionaire-founder-of-luminar-replaced-as-ceo-following-ethics-inquiry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">abruptly resigned</a> following an ethics inquiry from Luminar’s board of directors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-bad-news\">“More bad news”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Chiu’s account, Volvo kept promising that it would meet the lifetime order of 1.1 million units despite the reduced volume in 2024. So Luminar kept pressing forward under that assumption. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But signs of stress were showing. Luminar laid off 20% of its workforce in May 2024 and outsourced more of its lidar sensor manufacturing. It <a href=\"https://www.luminartech.com/updates/a-message-from-founder-ceo-austin-russell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">deepened those cuts</a> and restructured some of its business in September 2024. Another round of layoffs came in May 2025 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/luminar-kicks-off-another-round-of-layoffs-amid-ceos-sudden-resignation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">after Russell resigned</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, “Volvo delivered more bad news,” Chiu wrote. The automaker decided to offer lidar as an option on the EX90 going forward, instead of making it a standard feature as originally planned. Volvo also told Luminar that it was shelving lidar on future vehicles “as a cost-cutting measure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This change reduced Volvo’s estimated lifetime volumes by approximately 90%,” Chiu wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar told Volvo on October 3 that it considered this a breach of the agreement the companies had first signed in 2020. On October 31, the dispute became public, as Luminar told shareholders in a regulatory filing that it was suspending sensor shipments to Volvo. The Swedish automaker sent Luminar a letter two weeks later, terminating the agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar had started selling lidar sensors meant for Volvo “to adjacent markets in an effort to recover its sunk costs,” according to Chiu’s filing, but it was too little too late.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As its relationship with Volvo deteriorated, [Luminar] worked tirelessly to identify new customers, but was ultimately unable to enter into production with any new customers in a timely fashion,” Chiu wrote. “The public Volvo dispute also resulted in a decline in sales due to broader market concerns over Luminar’s financial future.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the future of what’s left of Luminar is in the hands of its creditors and the court. It’s seeking the judge’s approval to sell the semiconductor subsidiary to Quantum Computing, Inc. <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/111/luminar-announces-sale-of-photonics-business-to-quantum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">for $110 million</a>, and hopes to court a number of bidders for the lidar business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar has already had significant interest in the lidar business, according to the filing. In January, Chiu wrote, the company hired investment bank Jefferies to evaluate a sale after receiving an “unsolicited acquisition proposal.” Luminar received “additional unsolicited inbound expressions of interest to acquire the Company” through the summer and fall — including one submitted by Russell through his new AI lab in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TechCrunch reported Monday, Russell <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">plans to keep bidding</a> on Luminar’s remains as the bankruptcy case moves forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While patients expected doctors to respond as quickly as their delivery apps, most medical professionals on the continent are forced to rely on WhatsApp for all patient communication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I thought, as a patient, especially as an American, how incredible that I can text my doctor on WhatsApp, and they’ll respond,” she told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Merin also realized just how overwhelming this communication method had become for physicians. “A doctor who sees 20 patients during the day, gets home, has 100 messages and is expected to answer immediately and remember who the patient is without the health record in front of them,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merin, who had long been interested in building her own startup, saw an opportunity to improve doctors’ communication challenges. So, two years ago, she launched <a href=\"https://www.leona.health/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Leona Health</a>, an AI-copilot integrated with doctors’ WhatsApp accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, Leona revealed that it raised $14 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst; Accel; Maven Clinic CEO Kate Ryder; Nubank CEO David Vélez; and Rappi CEO Simón Borrero. The startup also announced that its service is now available to doctors in 14 Latin American countries across 22 medical specialties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Leona, patients continue to send messages on WhatsApp, but doctors receive and manage that communication through the startup’s mobile app. The app sorts all messages in order of priority, suggests responses, and allows other team members (like doctors or nurses) to reply to patients on the doctor’s behalf.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup will also soon launch a fully autonomous agent that will handle conversational scheduling and simple intake.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solving the WhatsApp communication challenge in Latin America is critical because, according to Merin, patients in Latin America often choose their doctors based on their willingness to communicate using this channel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These poor doctors, they’re receiving requests for very serious medical consults to, ‘I need a letter for my kids’ school,’ or, ‘I want a receipt for my appointment last week,’” Merin said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since these messages can arrive in the evenings and on weekends, physicians are often forced to monitor their WhatsApp around the clock. Leona solves this by immediately alerting doctors only to the most serious health requests and allowing them to deprioritize more routine or administrative questions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The idea is to help the doctor regain time,” Merin said. “We’re hearing from our users that they’re saving two to three hours a day by using Leona.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Leona is starting by serving Latin America, the company’s long-term mission is to expand its services to other geographies, where, unlike in the U.S., patients also demand and are permitted to communicate with their doctors via WhatsApp, rather than through electronic medical records systems like Epic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leona’s team of 13 is currently split between Mexico City and Silicon Valley, where, according to Merin, the best AI engineers are located.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This represents Netflix’s second major step into the podcast space, following its recent collaboration with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new video podcast episodes will premiere on Netflix in the U.S. in early 2026, with plans to expand to additional markets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the agreement, Netflix will get a diverse range of shows spanning comedy, crime, history, sports, and more, which feature notable names such as “Dear Chelsea” with Chelsea Handler, “The Breakfast Club” with Charlamagne, and “My Favorite Murder” with Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal covers all new episodes from the podcast lineup, as well as select library episodes from each show. Meanwhile, iHeartMedia will retain the audio-only rights and distribution, ensuring podcasts remain available on iHeartRadio and other major podcast platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix hopes that the millions of people who prefer the video version of these shows will flock to the streaming platform over competitors like YouTube. However, since these podcasters are no longer getting video versions of their shows on YouTube, they could lose out on ad revenue and reach, potentially alienating fans who are accustomed to watching there. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal follows Netflix’s announcement of a similar deal with Spotify for shows including “The Ringer,” “The Bill Simmons Podcast,” and “The Zach Lowe Show.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix’s push into video podcasts is part of its mission to broaden its offerings beyond TV shows and movies.

She would listen to every podcast and read each book, taking notes on topics that interested her.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She didn’t think much of it until one summer when so many of her friends got married that she found herself spending thousands of dollars on bridesmaid dresses and bachelorette looks. One day, someone approached her and asked to borrow one of her dresses. “I was like ‘yeah, for sure, take it,’” she recalled. “And then I thought, ‘how can this be done on a larger scale?’” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alles had all these expensive dresses just sitting in her closet. She didn’t want to sell them, but she knew she probably would never wear those gowns again. “That’s what led me, long story short, to create Rax,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alles <a href=\"https://www.raxapp.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched Rax earlier</a> this year as a peer-to-peer clothing rental company. It functions right now as a marketplace (it does not own any clothing inventory), where users scroll through listings and connect with people who have clothing items they want to rent.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She’s bootstrapped the company so far, enough to fully code the app and officially launch it. The first few customers were her friends and family, and the rest came by word of mouth. Alles said she leaned into the idea of “building in public,” where she posted online about her adventures creating this product in hopes of amassing an engaged audience of potential customers. She has about 5,000 users on the app right now.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rax is one of the first of its kind to be launched in Toronto. It’s like Rent-the-Runway, or New York’s Pickle, or Europe’s By Rotation. The idea of renting clothes — similar to buying secondhand — has been picking up steam as it is seen as a more environmentally sustainable way to consume fashion rather than buying new items for each new season.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s driving the circularity of fashion,” Alles said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what makes Rax different from many others is that she offers long-term rentals. “On our platform, you can rent up to six months,” she said. “On competitor platforms, it’s daily rentals. So it gets really expensive if you want to rent for a couple-week vacation. Or maybe you want a winter jacket for the season.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Rax announced its first foray into the U.S. market. Alles said she had been a huge fan of TechCrunch and applied for the Battlefield competition, where she later won the top consumer pitch in the competition.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alles said she was surprised to win. “There were so many companies that had like thousands or hundreds of thousands of users; raised [like] $20 million in my category, and one [had] the lead actors from [the show] Silicon Valley,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, she found the experience “awesome.” Alles went up to every startup booth to introduce herself to other founders, and also attended some sessions as well as partook in networking. Actually, that was one of the biggest lessons she said she’s learned as a founder — the importance of in-person interaction, because it helps her connect with the community better.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now that Disrupt has passed, Alles said the company hopes to continue its expansion across New York and start building out a rental service platform to offer fashion designers and retailers looking to offer rental clothing to consumers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have the technology, we have the audience,” she said, adding that brands are also looking at ways to become more sustainable, and companies like Rax let them do it. “I think things are getting better and people are becoming more aware of their impact.”  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is piloting IG for TV, a new experience that lets you watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing Reels to TVs, Instagram can better compete with YouTube, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/\">largely dominates the TV space</a>. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. For example, you could be watching something on Netflix and decide you don’t have the attention span for a movie or episode, and decide to watch Reels instead.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IG for TV is personalized to each user, as it shows Reels based on the content and creators you enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels will be organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle, making it easier to explore different types of videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reels will also play automatically, so you won’t have to keep scrolling to watch what’s next. You still have the option to skip to the next Reel. You can like, view comments, and re-share reels.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076394\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Instagram</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users have the option to pair IG for TV with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home.

The funding comes more than two years after the startup’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/20/digantara-funding-peak-xv-partners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$10 million Series A1 round</a>, bringing its total capital raised to $64.5 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Globally, governments are <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/government-public-sector-services/earth-observation-sustainable-economic-growth.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investing more heavily in space-based surveillance</a> and early-warning systems as missile launches and satellite interference become more frequent, with many seeking faster detection than traditional ground-based radar can provide. Digantara aims to tap that market by using its space- and ground-based infrared sensors along with software-based analytics and intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2020, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup initially focused on space situational awareness, tracking debris and objects that could damage satellites. The startup has since expanded its scope to include missile detection and tracking, building on the space- and ground-based sensing and analytics technologies it developed for space surveillance, its founder and chief executive Anirudh Sharma (pictured above) said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2025/01/space-tech-startup-digantara-scot-satellite-spacex-transporter-12-mission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched</a> its first space surveillance satellite, SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking), in January aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-12 mission, enabling space-to-space observation. A month later, the startup <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/indias-digantara-establishes-us-operations-for-space-intel-ahead-of-pm-modis-visit/articleshow/118134447.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">opened an office in Colorado Springs</a> as part of its push into the U.S. defense market, a move that has since led to contracts with U.S. Space Command for analytics as a service. Its U.S. entity has also been selected for the Missile Defense Agency’s SHIELD contract vehicle, which supports next-generation missile defense programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given we’ve already built IR sensors, we are now extending our IR capabilities to other domains like mid- and long-wave infrared,” Sharma told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara has split its operations across geographies to meet national security requirements. Its U.S. team is focused on building larger satellites and spacecraft in the 100-kilogram class tailored to American defense needs, while its India operation concentrates on analytics, data processing, and space situational awareness. The structure reflects the regulatory realities of defense procurement, where sensitive systems must be designed and built domestically for each market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara has so far closed contracts with a combined value of about $25 million, Sharma told TechCrunch. The startup currently operates across India, Singapore, and the U.S., and plans to expand into Europe by setting up a local entity there as early as 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In India, Digantara operates a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility capable of producing up to five satellites simultaneously, and plans to scale that capacity significantly. The startup has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government of Andhra Pradesh to set up a larger facility that could manufacture as many as 30 satellites at once, which it aims to bring online next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara has already been selected as the winning bidder for government defense tenders in India and is completing administrative formalities before work begins, Sharma said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through 2026–27, Digantara plans to expand its space- and ground-based infrastructure, including additional electro-optical and lidar satellites for space surveillance, space-based sensors for early missile warning and tracking, and a larger network of ground-based observatories, the company said. It is also exploring the potential use of its lidar and laser technologies for future interceptor systems, Sharma asserted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara plans to launch another satellite through SpaceX in March, followed by additional launches in June and October, with multiple satellites scheduled for the latter mission. The company aims to deploy a total of 15 satellites over the next two years, Sharma said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest funding, he noted, will support those launches, with about $7 million to $10 million earmarked for expansion in the United States and roughly $2 million to $3 million set aside to establish operations in Europe, while the remainder will be used to scale its India-based manufacturing and operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara has seen revenues grow more than tenfold over the past two years, Sharma said, declining to disclose current figures. He added that the company is targeting annual revenues of $25 million to $30 million over the next 18 months as defense and government work ramps up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently employs around 125 people, including roughly 80 to 85 engineers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthropic-databricks-team-up-in-scramble-for-ai-revenue-e15fe750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anthropic</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/databricks-will-bake-openai-models-into-its-products-in-100m-bet-to-spur-enterprise-adoption/\">OpenAI</a> to offer their models within its enterprise products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Series L rounds aren’t really common, but the fact that Databricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/databricks-raises-10b-as-it-barrels-toward-an-ipo/\">at $60 billion</a> around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/databricks-is-raising-funds-at-134-billion-valuation-4a2efaea?st=gxgVf7&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks’ co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P.

The company’s reactors are designed to produce 20 megawatts of electricity, enough to power roughly 15,000 homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has momentum. Last Energy just closed a $100 million Series C led by the Astera Institute with participation from AE Ventures, Galaxy Fund, Gigafund, JAM Fund, The Haskell Company, Ultranative, Woori Technology, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company joins a slew of nuclear startups that have raised funding in recent months, buoyed by data centers’ insatiable power demands. Google-backed X-energy raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/x-energy-rides-nuclear-wave-raises-700m-series-d/\">$700 million</a> last month, while Antares raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/microreactor-startup-antares-raises-96m-for-land-sea-and-space-based-nuclear-power/\">$96 million</a> two weeks ago. And in August, Aalo Atomics raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/19/aalo-atomics-raises-100m-to-build-a-microreactor-and-data-center-together/\">$100 million</a> to build its prototype reactor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What sets Last Energy apart from competitors is its approach: The company is using an old reactor design developed by the government decades ago. The initial design for the pressurized water reactor was built for the <a href=\"https://maritime.org/tour/savannah/press/part2b.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NS Savannah</a>, the world’s first nuclear-powered merchant ship. That ship’s power plant was about one-tenth the size of Last Energy’s planned commercial reactor. Kugelmass said the company’s updated design should produce 20 megawatts of electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is starting smaller, though. First, Last Energy is building a 5-megawatt pilot reactor at a site it’s leasing from Texas A&amp;M. The new funding will fully fund the pilot project and help the company start delivering its first commercial products, Kugelmass said. Last Energy hopes to turn on the pilot reactor next year, with its 20-megawatt commercial-scale unit entering production in 2028.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last Energy’s startup’s reactor isn’t designed to be serviced during its lifetime. Instead, Last Energy is permanently encasing each core in 1,000 tons of steel. Kugelmass estimates the metal will cost around $1 million. “Most people think concrete is cheaper,” he said. “But not when it’s nuclear-grade concrete.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reactors will arrive on site fueled with six years’ worth of uranium. Apart from electrical and control connections, there are no other penetrations that break the steel wall. Heat from the fission reactions warms the steel, and water flowing through pipes on the outside harvests that heat to spin a steam turbine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the reactor’s time is up, Last Energy will leave it on site, with the steel chamber serving as the waste cask, eliminating the need for separate disposal. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hope is that this approach, coupled with manufacturing advances, will drive down the price of nuclear power. Kugelmass wouldn’t commit to a price, instead pointing to other industries that have halved prices for every tenfold increase in production. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think it’s going to be that good in nuclear because there are always some extra fixed costs that you have in nuclear regarding some of the special regulations, but that’s the type of trend you can see,” he said. “We don’t think in ones and twos, we think in tens of thousands.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Everbloom-fibers.jpeg?resize=1200,800",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cashmere sweaters are everywhere these days, often at unbelievably low prices. The appeal is obvious: If you’ve ever worn cashmere, you know it’s soft, light, and warm — an impressive fiber that’s hard to give up. Unfortunately, those bargain prices usually come with a catch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cashmere comes from the fine undercoat of a handful of goat breeds. Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That’s not a lot of supply for a growing market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.everbloom.bio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Everbloom</a>, told TechCrunch. “What you’re seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they’re being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it’s creating unsustainable herding practices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors, including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/hyundai-is-working-with-a-startup-on-plant-based-leather-that-smells-like-the-real-thing/\">upcycled material</a> that’s nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called <a href=\"https://www.everbloom.bio/braid-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Braid.AI</a>. The model can fine-tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its core, Everbloom’s process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: They’re all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom’s process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All the components that we’re using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, it should be cheaper. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don’t believe in a ‘sustainable premium’” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That’s what we’re aiming for.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Tuesday, Neil Murray, founder and general partner at Copenhagen-based firm The Nordic Web Ventures, announced the close of a $6 million Fund III to continue investing in early-stage founders in the region. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fund will focus on writing the first institutional checks to companies focused on robotics, AI-native companies, and deep tech founders. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murray, a solo GP, told TechCrunch that his first two funds were “test vehicles” to prove his ability to spot and invest in top talent in the region. Now, seven years later, he has written the first check into more than 50 companies, with a portfolio including the unicorn Lovable and the remote worker insurance company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/safetywing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SafetyWing</a>, and exits like the UI design company Uizard. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TechCrunch previously reported, the Nordic ecosystem (which includes Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/breaking-down-the-boom-in-the-nordics-startup-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">now valued at more than half a trillion dollars</a> and received more than $8 billion in venture funding in 2024, making the region one of the hottest emerging markets in Europe. Murray said Fund III had more than $20 million in investor interest, but he decided to cap it at $6 million because he cares “more about alignment than AUM.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Staying small, he said, means he can better tie incentives to performance rather than management fees. He also said staying small, especially as a solo GP, gives him more flexibility while “everyone else is still debating.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Capping the fund wasn’t a constraint,” he said. “It was the strategy.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The check sizes for the fund will be around $200,000, and he hopes to back between 30 and 35 companies. “I believe it is more important to be investing in Tier 1 founders than to back Tier 2 founders and over-optimizing for ownership,” he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murray’s limited partner base includes institutional backers such as Allocator One, founder Christoph Janz, and Pacenotes. Founders from Kahoot and Pleo, in addition to operators from Meta and Google, are also LPs in Fund III.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many founders from my first two funds have invested in my new fund, which is also an incredibly important metric to me,” he said, adding that he’s already returned more than half the capital he raised across Fund I and Fund II.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His Fund III focuses on AI, robotics, and consumer, he said, because those are some of the top sectors in the Nordic region. Consumer has always been a top category in the sector, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/the-nordic-startup-scene-has-quietly-become-one-of-techs-fastest-growing-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as TechCrunch previously spoke about</a> on a podcast about the region.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The region is also known for its computer science, engineering culture, and manufacturing, which, paired with a “calm methodical build style,” positions the Nordics well for “AI-powered robotics in industrial, healthcare, logistics, and increasingly consumer context.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though he has a keen interest in the Nordics, Murray actually hails from the U.K. and moved to Denmark in 2013 without knowing a single person, he recalled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was very interested in tech startups, having worked in digital products in London,” he continued. When he moved to Copenhagen, he realized the ecosystem has had a big contribution to the tech world, though people hardly spoke up about it. That led him to start the website “The Nordic Web,” where he broke down what was happening behind the curtains of the bugeoning tech scene there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That website saw him tracking investments and exits, and soon VCs were asking him which founders were looking for capital. Soon, Murray wanted in on the action, and in 2017, he launched a $500,000 Fund I. He stopped writing The Nordic Web shortly after to focus more on investing. And all of that has led him here. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Overall, the Nordics aren’t experiencing a ‘moment,’” he said. “They’re experiencing a compounding. The depth of talent, the ambition level, and the maturity of the ecosystem mean this wave isn’t a spike; it’s the foundation of the next decade of Nordic breakout companies.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chien compares some of those applications to the simple flashlight, which was initially a popular third-party download after the iPhone launched in 2008 but was quickly integrated into iOS itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He argued that, just as it took a few years for the smartphone platform to solidify before game-changing consumer apps emerged, AI platforms need a similar period of “stabilization” for lasting AI consumer products to flourish.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we’re right on the cusp of the equivalent to mobile of the 2009-2010 era,” Chien said. That period was the birth of massive mobile-first consumer businesses like Uber and Airbnb.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We could be seeing inklings of that stabilization with Google’s Gemini reaching technological parity with ChatGPT, Chien said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elizabeth Weil, founder and partner at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/in-a-crowded-vc-landscape-elizabeth-weils-scribble-ventures-shows-that-networks-still-matter/\">Scribble Ventures</a>, echoed Chien’s sentiment about the early days of GenAI, describing the current state of consumer AI applications as being in an “awkward teenage middle ground.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What will it take for consumer AI startups to grow up? Possibly a new device beyond the smartphone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s unlikely that a device that you pick up 500 times a day but only sees 3% to 5% of what you see is going to be what ultimately introduces the use cases that take full advantage of AI’s capabilities,” Chien said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weil agreed that a smartphone may be too limiting for reimagining consumer AI products in large part because it is not ambient. “I don’t think we’re going to be building for this in five years,” she said, indicating her iPhone as she showed it to the audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups and incumbent tech companies have been racing to build a new personal device that can supplant smartphones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI and Apple’s former design chief, Jony Ive, are working on what’s rumored to be a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/altman-describes-openais-forthcoming-ai-device-as-more-peaceful-and-calm-than-the-iphone/\">“screenless,” pocket-sized device.</a> Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/\">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> are controlled by a wristband that detects subtle gestures. Meanwhile, a number of startups are trying, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">with often disappointing results</a>, to introduce a pin, pendant, or ring that uses AI in a way different from how smartphones do.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, not every AI consumer product will be dependent on a new device. Chien suggested that one such offering could be a personal AI financial adviser customized to the user’s specific needs. Similarly, Weil anticipates that a personalized, “always-on” tutor will become ubiquitous, with its specialized tutelage delivered directly from a smartphone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though excited by AI’s potential, Weil and Chien expressed skepticism about the emergence of several, still-stealthy AI-powered social network startups. Chien said these companies are building networks where thousands of AI bots are interacting with the user’s content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It turns social into a single-player game. I’m not sure that it works,” he said. “The reason that people enjoy social networking is the understanding that there are real humans on the other side.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The investor described Chai as a startup that was building foundation models tuned for drug discovery, specifically to predict interactions between biochemical molecules so they could be reprogramed for cures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chai says that its ambition is to “build the ‘computer-aided design suite’ for molecules.” Last year, the startup <a href=\"https://www.chaidiscovery.com/news/introducing-chai-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced the</a> Chai 1 AI model and is now offering Chai 2, it’s latest model.
