A vibe check crept in the second half of the year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/openai-raises-40b-at-300b-post-money-valuation/\">raised $40 billion</a> at a $300 billion valuation. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-valued-at-32b/\">Safe Superintelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\">Thinking Machine Labs</a> raised individual $2 billion seed rounds before shipping a single product. Even first-time founders were raising at a scale that once belonged only to Big Tech. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such astronomical investments were followed by equally incredible spends. Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/scale-ai-confirms-significant-investment-from-meta-says-ceo-alexandr-wang-is-leaving/\">shelled out nearly $15 billion</a> to lock up Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and spent countless more millions to poach talent from other AI labs. Meanwhile, AI’s biggest players promised close to $1.3 trillion in future infrastructure spending. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first half of 2025 matched the fervor, and investor interest, of the prior year. That mood has shifted in recent months to deliver a vibe check of sorts. Extreme optimism for AI, and the accompanying wild valuations, is still intact. But that rosy view is now being tempered with concerns over an AI bubble bursting, user safety, and the sustainability of technological progress at its current pace. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The era of unabashed acceptance and celebration of AI is fading just a skosh at the edges. And with it, more scrutiny and questions. Can AI companies sustain their own velocity? Does scaling in the post-DeepSeek era require billions? Is there a business model that returns a sliver of the multi-billions of investment? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve been there for every step. And our most popular stories of 2025 tell the real story: an industry hitting a reality check even as it promises to reshape reality itself. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-the-year-started\"><strong>How the year started</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034685\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">WASHINGTON, DC – JANUARY 21: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appears during a news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest AI labs got bigger this year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025 alone, OpenAI raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/26/openai-will-reportedly-close-its-softbank-led-40-billion-round-soon/\">Softbank-led $40 billion round</a> at a $300 billion post-money valuation. The company also reportedly has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/amazon-reportedly-in-talks-to-invest-10b-in-openai-as-circular-deals-stay-popular/\">investors like Amazon</a> orbiting with compute-tied circular deals, and is in talks to raise <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/\">$100 billion at an $830 billion<strong> </strong>valuation</a>. That would bring OpenAI close to the $1 trillion valuation it is reportedly seeking in an IPO next year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI rival Anthropic also closed $16.5 billion this year across two rounds, its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">most recent raise pushed its valuation to $183 billion</a> with heavy hitters like Iconiq Capital, Fidelity, and the Qatar Investment Authority participating. (CEO Dario Amodei confessed to staff in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-dario-amodei-gulf-state-leaked-memo/\">leaked memo</a> that he was “not thrilled” about taking money from dictatorial Gulf states). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s Elon Musk’s xAI, which raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/xai-raises-10b-in-debt-and-equity/\">at least $10 billion</a> this year after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/\">acquiring X</a>, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk also owns.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve also seen smaller, new startups get a hypey boost from froth-mouthed investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Former OpenAI chief technologist Mira Murati’s startup Thinking Machine Labs secured a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\">$2 billion seed round at a $12 billion valuation</a> despite sharing almost no information about its product offering. Vibe-coding startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/lovable-becomes-a-unicorn-with-200m-series-a-just-8-months-after-launch/\">Lovable’s $200 million Series A</a> earned it a unicorn horn just eight months after launching; this month, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/vibe-coding-startup-lovable-raises-330m-at-a-6-6b-valuation/\">Lovable raised another $330 million</a> at a nearly $7 billion post-money valuation. And we can’t leave out AI recruiting startup Mercor, which raised $450 million this year across two rounds, the latest bringing its valuation up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/mercor-quintuples-valuation-to-10b-with-350m-series-c/\">$10 billion</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These absurdly large valuations are still happening even against the backdrop of still-modest enterprise adoption figures and serious infrastructure constraints, heightening fears of an AI bubble. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-build-baby-build\"><strong>Build, baby, build</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030503\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Dominion Energy’s Mount Storm coal-fired power station is planned to power a vast data center complex in West Virginia.

Justifying those valuations requires building vast amounts of infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result has created a vicious cycle. Capital raised to fund compute is increasingly tied to deals where the same money flows back into chips, cloud contracts, and energy, as seen in OpenAI’s infrastructure-linked funding <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-as-huang-touts-biggest-ai-infrastructure-project-in-history-171740509.html\">with Nvidia</a>. In practice, it’s blurring the line between investment and customer demand, stoking fears that the AI boom is being propped up by circular economics rather than sustainable usage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the biggest <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">deals this year powering the infrastructure boom</a> were: </p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">Stargate</a>, a joint venture between Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle, which includes up to $500 billion to build AI infrastructure in the U.S. </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Alphabet’s acquisition of energy and data center infrastructure provider <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/alphabet-to-buy-intersect-power-to-bypass-energy-grid-bottlenecks/\">Intersect</a> for $4.75 billion, which comes as the company said in October it plans to lift its compute spend in 2026 up to $93 billion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">accelerated data center expansion</a>, which has pushed its projected capital expenditures up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/meta-to-spend-up-to-72b-on-ai-infrastructure-in-2025-as-compute-arms-race-escalates/\">to $72 billion in 2025</a> as the company races to secure enough compute to train and run next-generation models. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But cracks are beginning to show. A private financing partner, Blue Owl Capital, recently<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-17/oracle-blue-owl-decoupling-rattles-markets-ahead-of-debt-deluge\"> pulled out</a> of a planned $10 billion Oracle data-center deal tied to OpenAI capacity, underscoring how fragile some of these capital stacks can be. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether all that spending ultimately materializes is another question. Grid constraints, soaring construction and power costs, and growing pushback from residents and policymakers – including calls from figures like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/robbys-radar/5655111-bernie-sanders-data-center-moratorium/\">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> to rein in data center expansion – are already<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\"> slowing projects</a> in some regions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even as AI investment remains enormous, the infrastructure reality is beginning to temper the hype. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-expectation-reset\"><strong>The expectation reset</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"In this photo illustration, the DeepSeek logo is seen next to the Chat GPT logo on a phone.\" class=\"wp-image-2958181\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=1200,801 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=900,601 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Anthony Kwan / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023 and 2024, each major model release felt like a revelation, with new capabilities and fresh reasons to fall for the hype. This year, the magic faded, and nothing captured that shift better than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it was meaningful on paper,<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/\"> it didn’t land with the same punch</a> as<em> </em>earlier releases like GPT-4 and 4o. Similar patterns emerged across the industry as improvements from LLM providers were less transformative and more incremental or domain-specific. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\">Gemini 3</a>, which is topping several benchmarks, was only a breakthrough insofar as it brought Google back up to equal footing with OpenAI – which sparked Sam Altman’s infamous ‘code red’ memo and OpenAI’s fight to maintain dominance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There was also a reset this year in terms of where we expect frontier models to come from. DeepSeek’s launch of<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/\"> R1, its “reasoning” model</a> that competed with OpenAI’s o1 on key benchmarks, proved that new labs can ship credible models fast and at a fraction of the cost. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-model-breakthroughs-to-business-models\"><strong>From model breakthroughs to business models</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2928859\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg 4193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Demis Hassabis, chief executive officer of DeepMind Technologies </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jose Sarmento Matos/Bloomberg / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the size of each leap between new models shrinks, investors are focused less on raw model capacity and more on what’s wrapped around it. The question is: who can turn AI into a product that people rely on, pay for, and integrate into their daily workflows? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That shift is manifesting in several ways as companies see what works, and what customers will let fly. AI search startup Perplexity, for example, briefly floated the idea of tracking users’ online movements to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/perplexity-ceo-says-its-browser-will-track-everything-users-do-online-to-sell-hyper-personalized-ads/\">sell them hyper-personalized ads</a>. Meanwhile, OpenAI was reportedly considering charging up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents/\">$20,000 per month for specialized AI</a>, a sign of how aggressively companies tested the waters of what customers might be willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than anything, though, the fight has moved to distribution. Perplexity is trying to stay relevant by launching its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Comet browser</a> with agentic capabilities and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/06/perplexity-to-pay-snap-400m-to-power-search-in-snapchat/\">paying Snap $400 million</a> to power search inside Snapchat, effectively buying its way into existing user funnels. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is pursuing a parallel strategy, expanding ChatGPT beyond a chatbot and into a platform. OpenAI has launched its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/\">Atlas browser </a>and other consumer-facing features like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-launches-chatgpt-pulse-to-proactively-write-you-morning-briefs/\">Pulse</a>, while also courting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/10/openais-enterprise-adoption-appears-to-be-accelerating-at-the-expense-of-rivals/\">enterprises</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/chatgpt-launches-an-app-store-lets-developers-know-its-open-for-business/\">developers</a> by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\">launching apps inside ChatGPT</a> itself. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, for its part, is leaning on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/one-of-googles-biggest-ai-advantages-is-what-it-already-knows-about-you/\">incumbency</a>. On the consumer side, Gemini is being integrated directly into products like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/googles-gemini-can-now-help-you-schedule-google-calendar-meetings/\">Google Calendar</a>, while on the enterprise side, the company is hosting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-is-going-all-in-on-mcp-servers-agent-ready-by-design/\">MCP connectors</a> to make its ecosystem harder to dislodge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a market where it’s getting tougher to differentiate by dropping a new model, owning the customer and the business model is the real moat. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-trust-and-safety-vibe-check\"><strong>The trust and safety vibe check</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Character.AI under 18\" class=\"wp-image-3063424\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg 2442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=768,524 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=680,464 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1200,819 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1280,873 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=430,293 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=720,491 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=900,614 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=800,546 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1536,1048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1397 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=668,456 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=550,375 550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=904,617 904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=708,483 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">After multiple teens died by suicide after prolonged conversations with chatbots, Character AI removed the chatbot experience for under 18s in November 2025. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Character.AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI companies received unprecedented scrutiny in 2025. More than 50 copyright lawsuits wound through the courts, while reports of “AI psychosis” – the result of chatbots reinforcing delusions and allegedly contributing to multiple suicides and other life-threatening episodes – sparked calls for trust and safety reforms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some copyright battles met their end – like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\">Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement to authors</a> – most are still unresolved. Though the conversation appears to be shifting from resistance against using copyrighted content for training, to demands for compensation (See:<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/the-new-york-times-is-suing-perplexity-for-copyright-infringement/\"> New York Times sues Perplexity for copyright infringement</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, mental health concerns around AI chatbot interactions – and their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">sycophantic responses</a> – emerged as a serious public health issue following <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">multiple deaths by suicide</a> and life-threatening delusions in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\">teens</a> and adults after prolonged chatbot usage. The result has been lawsuits, widespread concern among mental health professionals, and swift policy responses like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots/\">California’s SB 243 regulating AI companion bots</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps most telling: the calls for restraints are not coming from the usual anti-tech suspects. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Industry leaders have warned against chatbots “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/ai-chatbots-are-juicing-engagement-instead-of-being-useful-instagram-co-founder-warns/\">juicing engagement</a>,” and even Sam Altman has cautioned against emotional over-reliance on ChatGPT. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even the labs themselves started sounding alarms. Anthropic’s May safety report documented Claude Opus 4 attempting to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropics-new-ai-model-turns-to-blackmail-when-engineers-try-to-take-it-offline/\">blackmail engineers</a> to prevent its own shutdown. The subtext? Scaling without understanding what you’ve built is no longer a viable strategy.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-looking-ahead\"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If 2025 was the year AI started to grow up and face hard questions, 2026 will be the year it has to answer them. The hype cycle is starting to fizzle out, and now AI companies will be forced to prove their business models and demonstrate real economic value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The era of ‘trust us, the returns will come’ is nearing its end. What comes next will either be a vindication or a reckoning that makes the dot-com bust look like a bad day of trading for Nvidia.

While Bee was acquired by Amazon, and devices like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\">Stream ring</a> by Sandbar and a new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/\">AI ring</a> from former Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky are set to enter the market next year, the jury is still out on the success of wearable AI devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid all this, Plaud is thriving by targeting professional users with a different approach: a credit card-sized recording device that slips into your wallet. The company says it has shipped more than a million units and that more than 50% of its customers have converted to pro subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s latest iteration, the Plaud Note Pro, launched for pre-order in August two years after the original Note, priced at $179. After using the device for over a month, it has become an essential part of my daily carry – and its ultra-thin design makes that easy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At just 0.12 inches thick – about the width of three stacked credit cards – it’s the thinnest AI recording device on the market and easily fits in a wallet or attaches magnetically to the back of your phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company provides a wallet-like pouch and a magnetic ring accessory that attaches to MagSafe-enabled phones, allowing you to mount the Note Pro on the back of your iPhone or compatible Android device. The device is also very light at 30 grams, and you won’t feel the weight if you keep the Note Pro in your wallet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the key differences between Plaud and other AI wearables is that the Note Pro doesn’t need to be connected to your phone to record audio. The device has 64GB of onboard memory, so it can store a large volume of recordings without transferring them to your phone or uploading them to the cloud.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077731\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg 3681w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Pluad Note Pro is as thick as a coaster Image Credits: Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaud Note Pro has four MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) microphones to pick up audio from all directions. While the company advertises that the effective audio range is 16.4 feet, I have recorded talks at conferences while sitting far from the stage and gotten satisfactory results. The device also has one voice processing unit for noise suppression, voice isolation, and echo cancellation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recording device has impressive battery life. I went to a conference earlier this month with a fully charged device and recorded a few interviews and talks there. After that, I used the device for some phone call recording and personal note-taking. Despite all that use, the device still had 55% charge after 15 days. The company says you can wring 30 hours of continuous recording and 60 days of standby from a single charge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaud’s new device comes with a proprietary charger with a USB-C cable on the other end. The device takes two hours to charge from 0%, and then you are set for at least a couple of weeks unless you are recording hours of content.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3040223\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg 3841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Plaud</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Plaud.ai</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One problem with wearable AI devices is that you have to ensure, through an indicator, that the device is recording (or has stopped recording). Thankfully, Plaud Note Pro has a tiny screen that displays your recording status. You can also press a button while recording to highlight a point a speaker is making, and it will show up in the AI-powered summary prominently. The screen also shows you the remaining battery level.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is intentionality behind recording with this device. You also get haptic feedback for starting and stopping the recording. The visual indication and your action of pressing the button also make it easier to signal to a others in the meeting that you are recording the session.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077732\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg 5712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=768,531 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=1200,830 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=1280,885 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=430,297 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=720,498 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=900,622 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=800,553 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=1536,1062 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=2048,1416 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=668,462 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=542,375 542w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=892,617 892w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=708,489 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can choose to just record sessions and export them to another AI transcription service you are subscribed to. Plaud natively provides 300 minutes of free transcription every month. The company also lets you customize AI-generated notes through templates suited for different profiles and tasks. You can create your own template as well. The transcription is accurate in most instances, and now you can also access the recording, transcript, and notes through a website. The company has also addressed the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/plauds-169-chatgpt-powered-notepin-has-a-permanent-place-in-my-travel-bag/\">problem my former colleague Brian Heater had</a> of tapping on the word and not being played the corresponding recording.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a pendant or pin-like form factor is possibly easier to carry, the card-sized recorder offers better microphones and more versatile placement options.

And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Electricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/boom-supersonic-raises-300m-to-build-natural-gas-turbines-for-crusoe-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">repurposing supersonic jet engines</a> for data center duty and working on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/overview-energy-wants-to-beam-energy-from-space-to-existing-solar-farms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">beaming solar power down from space</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that pace of growth isn’t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">projected to nearly triple</a> in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consumer frustration</a> around pricing and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/environmental-groups-call-for-halt-to-new-data-center-construction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drawn the ire of environmental groups</a> that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/gridcare-thinks-more-than-100-gw-of-data-center-capacity-is-hiding-in-the-grid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gridcare</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/yottar-wants-to-help-energy-users-find-capacity-on-the-electrical-grid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yottar</a> argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber-optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amid the data center boom.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it’s needed most.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Base Power, for example, is building one in Texas by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/base-power-raises-1b-to-deploy-home-batteries-everywhere/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">leasing batteries to homeowners</a> at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn’t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other startups, including Texture, Uplight, and Camus, are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/texture-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developing software layers</a> to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&amp;D organization, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/nvidia-thinks-ai-can-solve-electrical-grid-problems-caused-by-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to develop industry-specific models</a> in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/google-thinks-ai-can-untangle-the-electrical-grids-bureaucracy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">working with the grid operator PJM</a> to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These changes won’t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Utilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they’re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it’s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Software, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances. It’s cheap, flexible, and speedy to deploy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/you-can-now-connect-your-spotify-account-to-chatgpt-heres-how-to-do-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify integration</a>, you can tell it to create personalized playlists that will show up right in your Spotify app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get started, make sure you’re logged into ChatGPT. Then type the name of the app you want to use at the start of your prompt, and ChatGPT will guide you through signing in and connecting your account.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you want to set everything up at once, head over to the Settings menu, then click on Apps and Connectors. You can browse through the available apps, pick the ones you like, and it’ll take you to the sign-in page for each one. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it’s important to note that connecting your account means you’re sharing your app data with ChatGPT. Make sure to review the permissions you’re giving when you’re linking your accounts. For example, if you connect your Spotify account, ChatGPT can see your playlists, listening history, and other personal information. (Sharing this info helps personalize the experience, but if you have privacy concerns, consider whether you’re comfortable with this level of access before connecting.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also disconnect any app whenever you want, right from the Settings menu.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-available-apps\">Available apps </h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3062079\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Booking_OpenAI.png.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-booking-com\">Booking.com</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This integration with the online travel giant is designed to help travelers, especially first-time visitors in need of suggestions for where to stay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once you link your Booking.com account, you can ask ChatGPT to find hotels in your preferred city based on your dates and budget.

Since then, optimists have regularly claimed that AI will become a critical part of the enterprise software industry, and so enterprise AI startups mushroomed on the back of immense amounts of investment.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But enterprises are still struggling to see the benefit of adopting these new AI tools. An <a href=\"https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MIT survey in August</a> found that 95% of enterprises weren’t getting a meaningful return on their investments in AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So when will businesses start seeing real benefits from using and integrating AI? TechCrunch surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs, and they overwhelmingly think 2026 will be the year when enterprises start to meaningfully adopt AI, see value from it, <em>and </em>increase their budgets for the tech.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprise VCs have been saying that for three years now. Will 2026 actually be different? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s hear what they have to say:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend:</strong> Enterprises are realizing that LLMs are not a silver bullet for most problems. Just because Starbucks can use Claude to write their own CRM software doesn’t mean they should. We’ll focus on custom models, fine tuning, evals, observability, orchestration, and data sovereignty.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Molly Alter, partner, Northzone:</strong> A subset of enterprise AI companies will shift from product businesses to AI consulting. These companies may start with a specific product, such as AI customer support or AI coding agents. But once they have enough customer workflows running off their platform, they can replicate the forward-deployed engineer model with their own team to build additional use cases for customers. In other words, many specialized AI product companies will become generalist AI implementers. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Marcie Vu, partner, Greycroft:</strong> We’re very excited about the opportunity in voice AI. Voice is a far more natural, efficient, and expressive way for people to communicate with each other and with machines. We’ve spent decades typing on computers and staring at screens, but speech is how we engage in the real world. I am eager to see how builders reimagine products, experiences, and interfaces with voice as the primary mode of interaction with intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner, Inspired Capital:</strong> 2026 will be the year AI reshapes the physical world — especially in infrastructure, manufacturing, and climate monitoring. We are moving from a reactive world to a predictive one, where physical systems can sense problems before they become failures.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners:</strong> We’re watching how frontier labs approach the application layer. A lot of people assumed labs would just train models and hand them off for others to build on, but that doesn’t seem to be how they are thinking about it. We may see frontier labs shipping more turnkey applications directly into production in domains like finance, law, healthcare, and education than people expect. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Tom Henriksson, general partner at OpenOcean:</strong> If I had to pick one word for quantum in 2026, it’s momentum. Trust in quantum advantage is building fast, with companies publishing roadmaps to demystify the tech. But don’t expect major software breakthroughs yet; we still need more hardware performance to cross that threshold.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-areas-are-you-looking-to-invest-in-nbsp\">Which areas are you looking to invest in? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Emily Zhao, principal, Salesforce Ventures:</strong> We are targeting two distinct frontiers — AI entering the physical world and the next evolution of model research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12:</strong> Future datacenter technology. For the last year or so, we’ve been standing up a few new investments that signal our interest in future “token factory” technology, with an eye towards what can really advance how efficiently and cleanly they run. This is going to continue in 2026 and beyond, in categories that include everything within the walls of the data center: cooling, compute, memory, and networking within and between sites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench:</strong> Vertical enterprise software where proprietary workflows and data create defensibility, particularly in regulated industries, supply chain, retail, and other complex operational environments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA:</strong> We are at the limit of humanity’s ability to generate enough energy to feed power-hungry GPUs. As an investor, I’m looking for software and hardware that can drive breakthroughs in performance per watt. This could be better GPU management, more efficient AI chips, next-gen networking approaches like optical, or rethinking thermal load within AI systems and data centers. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-when-it-comes-to-ai-startups-how-do-you-determine-that-a-company-has-a-moat-nbsp\">When it comes to AI startups, how do you determine that a company has a moat? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners:</strong> A moat in AI is less about the model itself and more about economics and integration. We look for companies that are deeply embedded in enterprise workflows, have access to proprietary or continuously improving data, and demonstrate defensibility through switching costs, cost advantages, or outcomes that are difficult to replicate.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: </strong>I’m skeptical of moats built purely on model performance or prompting — those advantages erode in months. The question I ask: If OpenAI or Anthropic launches a model tomorrow and is 10x better, does this company still have a reason to exist?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Molly Alter, partner, Northzone:</strong> It’s much easier today to build a moat in a vertical category rather than a horizontal one. The best moats are data moats, where each incremental customer, data point, or interaction makes the product better. These are somewhat easier to build in specialized categories like manufacturing, construction, health, or legal, where data is more consistent across customers. But there are also interesting “workflow moats,” where defensibility comes from understanding how a task or project moves from point A to point B in an industry.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Harsha Kapre, director, Snowflake Ventures:</strong> For AI startups, the strongest moat comes from how effectively they transform an enterprise’s existing data into better decisions, workflows, and customer experiences. Enterprises already sit on incredibly rich data; what they lack is the ability to reason over it in a targeted, trustworthy way. We look for startups that blend technical expertise with deep industry knowledge and can bring domain-specific solutions directly to a customer’s governed data, without creating new silos, to deliver insights or automation that weren’t previously possible.   </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-will-2026-be-the-year-when-enterprises-start-to-gain-value-from-ai-investments-nbsp\">Will 2026 be the year when enterprises start to gain value from AI investments? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend:</strong> Enterprises are realizing that random experiments with dozens of solutions create chaos. They will focus on fewer solutions with more thoughtful engagement.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures:</strong> The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces. In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Scott Beechuk, partner, Norwest Venture Partners:</strong> We’re definitely getting closer. If last year was about laying the infrastructure for AI, 2026 is when we begin to see whether the application layer can turn that investment into real value. As specialized models mature and oversight improves, AI systems are becoming more reliable in daily workflows.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital:</strong> Yes, but still incremental. There is still a lot of iteration, and AI is still improving to the point of being able to showcase pain-point solutions for enterprises across a variety of industries. I believe solving simulation to reality training will likely open up many opportunities for a selection of industries, both existing and nascent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz:</strong> There have been sensational headlines this year about enterprises not seeing returns on their AI investments. Ask any software engineer if they would ever want to go back to the dark ages before they had AI coding tools. Unlikely. My point is, enterprises are already gaining value this year, and it will multiply across organizations next year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-think-enterprises-will-increase-their-ai-budgets-in-2026-nbsp\">Do you think enterprises will increase their AI budgets in 2026? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire:</strong> Yes, I believe they will, though it’s nuanced. Rather than simply increasing AI budgets, organizations will shift portions of their labor spend toward AI technologies or generate such strong top-line ROI from AI capabilities that the investment effectively pays for itself three to five times over. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners:</strong> Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results, and will decline sharply for everything else. Overall spend may grow, but it will be significantly more concentrated. We expect a bifurcation, where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Gordon Ritter, founder and general partner, Emergence Capital:</strong> Yes, but spend will concentrate. Enterprises will increase budgets where AI expands on institutional advantages, and pull back from tools that simply automate workflows without capturing (and securing!) proprietary intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures:</strong> 2026 will be the year that CIOs push back on AI vendor sprawl. Today, enterprises are testing out multiple tools for a single use case — monthly spend and switching costs are low in many cases, so the incentive to experiment is there — and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts]. As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools, and deploy those savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ryan Isono, managing director, Maverick Ventures:</strong> In aggregate, yes, and there will be some shifting from pilots/experimental budgets to budgeted line items. A boon for AI startups in 2026 will be the transition of enterprises who tried to build in-house solutions and have now realized the difficulty and complexity required in production at scale.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-it-take-to-raise-a-series-a-as-an-enterprise-focused-ai-startup-in-2026-nbsp\">What does it take to raise a Series A as an enterprise-focused AI startup in 2026? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital:</strong> The best companies right now combine two things: a compelling “why now” narrative — usually tied to GenAI creating new attack surfaces, infrastructure needs, or workflow opportunities — and concrete proof of enterprise adoption. $1 million to $2 million [annual recurring revenue] is the baseline, but what matters more than that is whether customers view you and your product as mission-critical to their business versus just being a nice-to-have. Revenue without narrative is a feature; narrative without traction is vaporware. You need both. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners:</strong> You should aim to show you’re building in a space where the [total addressable market] expands rather than evaporates as AI drives down costs. Some markets have high elasticity of demand – a 90% price decline leads to a 10x increase in market size. Others have low elasticity, where dropping the price can vaporize the market, so the customers keep all of the value being created. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench:</strong> Customers are using the product in real, day-to-day operations, and are willing to take reference calls and talk honestly about impact, reliability, and buying process, etc. Companies should be able to clearly show how the product saves time, reduces cost or increases output in a way that holds up through security, legal, and procurement reviews. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12:</strong> We (investors) were casting a doubtful eye towards [estimated annual recurring revenue] or pilot revenue until recently. Now, it’s not seen as much of an asterisk as much as the customer’s interest and willingness to evaluate a solution in the face of so many options pushed their way. Getting those engagements and customer buy-in in terms of running an evaluation isn’t just a matter of forward-deployed engineers making it easier for the customer. It takes quality and a winning marketing message to do it in 2026. Investors are expecting to see conversions become the leading part of the story after 6 months of pilot use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital:</strong> Execution and traction. The best signal is users genuinely delighted to use the product, and the technical sophistication of the business. We look at a huge North Star of real contractual agreements, 12+ months. In addition to that, was this founder able to attract top-tier talent to join their startup over competitors or the traditional hyper-scalers?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-role-will-ai-agents-play-at-enterprises-by-the-end-of-2026-nbsp\">What role will AI agents play at enterprises by the end of 2026? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Nnamdi Okike, managing partner and co-founder, 645 Ventures:</strong> Agents will still be in their initial adoption phase by the end of 2026. There are many technical and compliance hurdles that need to be overcome for enterprises to truly benefit from AI agents. There also need to be standards created for agent-to-agent communication. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire:</strong> One universal agent will emerge. Today, each agent is siloed in its role – for example, inbound [sales development representative], outbound SDR, customer support, product discovery, etc. But by late next year, we’ll start to see these roles converge into a single agent with shared context and memory, breaking down long-standing organizational silos, and enabling a more unified, contextual conversation between companies and their users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures:</strong> The winners will be organizations that figure out the right balance of autonomy and oversight quickly, and that recognize agent deployment as collaborative augmentation rather than a clean division of labor. Rather than agents handling all routine work while humans do all the thinking, we’ll see more sophisticated collaboration between humans and agents on complex tasks, with the boundary between their roles continuously evolving. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA:</strong> The majority of knowledge workers will have at least one agentic co-worker they know by name! </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Eric Bahn, co-founder, general partner, Hustle Fund:</strong> I think that AI agents will probably be the bigger part of the workforce than any humans in enterprises. Proliferating AI agents is essentially free and zero marginal cost. So why not grow through bots? </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-kinds-of-companies-in-your-portfolio-are-seeing-the-strongest-growth-nbsp\">What kinds of companies in your portfolio are seeing the strongest growth? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital:</strong> The companies growing fastest are the ones that identified a workflow or security gap created by GenAI adoption, then executed relentlessly on product-market fit. In cybersecurity, it’s tools addressing data security so LLMs can interact with sensitive data safely, and agent governance ensuring autonomous systems have appropriate controls. In marketing, it’s new areas like Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — getting discovered in AI responses, not just search results. The common thread: these weren’t categories two years ago, but are now must-haves for enterprises deploying AI at scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures:</strong> We’re seeing growth tied to a few common themes. One is companies that land with focused use cases — companies that start with a narrower wedge (could be a focused target persona or use case), really nail it, become sticky and earn the right to expand from the initial wedge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz:</strong> Companies that help enterprises put AI into production are doing well. Areas like data extraction and structuring, developer productivity for AI systems, infrastructure for generative media, voice and audio for media and apps like support or call centers. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-kinds-of-companies-are-seeing-the-strongest-retention-nbsp\">What kinds of companies are seeing the strongest retention? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital:</strong> Companies with retention and expansion share a pattern: they solve problems that intensify as customers deploy more AI. Strong retention comes from three things: being mission-critical (removal breaks production workflows), accumulating proprietary context that’s hard to recreate, and solving problems that grow with AI adoption rather than being one-and-done. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Tom Henriksson, general partner at OpenOcean:</strong> Retention is trickier to measure for younger companies, but the highest retention we’re seeing is in the serious enterprise software providers, especially those enhanced with AI. A good example is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/KiOXC93z2zCxkYp1u1ujFqkGSr?domain=openocean.vc\">Operations1</a>, which digitizes employee-led production processes end-to-end. These companies go deep into the customer’s organization, transform how they operate, and build up proprietary data and knowledge that makes them very hard to do without. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12:</strong> Startups serving the enterprise in data tooling and vertical AI apps, with forward-deployed teams assisting in customer satisfaction, quality, and product improvement. This seems to be the winning formula that has been adopted by all leading startups in those markets. Longer term, the embedded teams might recede as the customers start to internalize the use of AI in their organizations and workday practices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench:</strong> Retention is highest where software becomes foundational infrastructure rather than a point solution. Authzed has strong retention because authorization and policy sit at the core of modern systems, and are extremely costly to rip out once embedded. Courier Health and GovWell act as systems of record and orchestration layers for end-to-end workflows, patient journeys in healthcare, and permitting in government, which makes them deeply embedded once live.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Still, he was shocked that he received a notification on his own phone. He called his father, turned off and put his phone away, and went to buy a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was panicking,” he told TechCrunch. “It was a mess. It was a huge mess.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gibson is just one of an ever-increasing number of people who are receiving notifications from companies like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://landing.google.com/intl/en_in/advancedprotection/\">Apple</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2017/03/reassuring-our-users-about-government.html\">Google</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/641700318302674\">WhatsApp</a>, all of which send similar warnings about spyware attacks to their users. Tech companies are increasingly proactive in alerting their users when they become targets of government hackers, and in particular those who use spyware made by companies such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/intellexa/\">Intellexa</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/\">NSO Group</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/paragon-solutions/\">Paragon Solutions</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while Apple, Google, and WhatsApp alert, they don’t get involved in what happens next. The tech companies direct their users to people who could help, but at which point the companies step away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is what happens when you receive one of these warnings. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-warning-nbsp\">Warning </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You have received a notification that you were the target of government hackers. Now what? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First of all, take it seriously. These companies have reams of telemetry data about their users and what happens on both their devices and their online accounts. These tech giants have security teams that have been hunting, studying, and analyzing this type of malicious activity for years. If they think you have been targeted, they are probably right. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s important to note that in the case of Apple and WhatsApp notifications, receiving one doesn’t mean you were necessarily hacked.

In other words, Google will tell you how to better protect yourself in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Apple ecosystem, you should turn on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120\">Lockdown Mode</a>, which switches on a series of security features that makes it more difficult for hackers to target your Apple devices.

Or do you have information about spyware makers? We would love to hear from you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reaching out for help</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What happens next depends on who you are. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are open source and downloadable tools that anyone can use to detect suspected spyware attacks on their devices, which requires a little technical knowledge. You can use the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt\">Mobile Verification Toolkit</a>, or MVT, a tool that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/\">lets you look for forensic traces of an attack</a> on your own, perhaps as a first step before looking for assistance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you don’t want or can’t use MVT, you can go straight to someone who can help. If you are a journalist, dissident, academic, or human rights activist, there are a handful of organizations that can help. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can turn to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/help/\">Access Now and its Digital Security Helpline</a>. You can also contact Amnesty International, which has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://securitylab.amnesty.org/get-help/\">its own team of investigators</a> and ample experience in these cases. Or, you can reach out to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/\">The Citizen Lab</a>, a digital rights group at the University of Toronto, which has been investigating spyware abuses for almost 15 years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you are a journalist, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://rsf.org/en/digital-security-lab\">Reporters Without Borders</a> also has a digital security lab that offers to investigate suspected cases of hacking and surveillance. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of these categories of people, politicians or business executives, for example, will have to go elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you work for a large company or political party, you likely have a competent (hopefully!) security team you can go straight to. They may not have the specific knowledge to investigate in-depth, but in that case they probably know who to turn to, even if Access Now, Amnesty, and Citizen Lab cannot help those outside of civil society. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Otherwise, there aren’t many places executives or politicians you can turn to, but we have asked around and found the ones below. We can’t fully vouch for any of these organizations, nor do we endorse them directly, but based on suggestions from people we trust, it’s worth pointing them out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the most well known of these private security companies is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iverify.io/\">iVerify</a>, which makes an app for Android and iOS, and also gives users an option to ask for an in-depth forensic investigation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Matt Mitchell, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/matt-mitchell-is-arming-underserved-communities-with-anti-surveillance-tools/\">a well-regarded security expert</a> who’s been helping vulnerable populations protect themselves from surveillance has a new startup, called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://safetysyncgroup.com/\">Safety Sync Group</a>, which offers this kind of service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jessica Hyde, a forensic investigator with experience in the public and private sectors, has her own startup called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hexordia.com/contact\">Hexordia</a>, and offers to investigate suspected hacks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mobile cybersecurity company Lookout, which has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/spyware-maker-caught-distributing-malicious-android-apps-for-years/\">experience</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/north-korean-government-hackers-snuck-spyware-on-android-app-store/\">analyzing</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/17/hermit-spyware-government/\">government</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/researchers-uncover-chinese-spyware-used-to-target-android-devices/\">spyware</a> from around the world, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lookout.com/form/report-mobile-incident\">has an online form</a> that allows people to reach out for help to investigate cyberattacks involving malware, device compromise, and more. The company’s threat intelligence and forensics teams may then get involved.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, there’s Costin Raiu, who heads <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tlpblack.net/\">TLPBLACK</a>, a small team of security researchers who used to work at Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Group, or GReAT. Raiu was the unit’s head when his team discovered sophisticated cyberattacks from elite government hacking teams from the United States, Russia, Iran, and other countries. Raiu told TechCrunch that people who suspect they’ve been hacked can <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"mailto:costin@tlpblack.net\">email him</a> directly.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Investigation</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What happens next depends on who you go to for help. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Generally speaking, the organization you reach out to may want to do an initial forensic check by looking at a diagnostic report file that you can create on your device, which you can share with the investigators remotely. At this point, this doesn’t require you to hand over your device to anyone. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This first step may be able to detect signs of targeting or even infection. It may also turn out nothing. In both cases, the investigators may want to dig deeper, which will require you to send in a full backup of your device, or even your actual device. At that point, the investigators will do their work, which may take time because modern government spyware attempts to hide and delete its tracks, and will tell you what happened. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately, modern spyware may not leave any traces. The modus operandi these days, according to Hassan Selmi, who leads the incident response team at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/meet-the-team-that-investigates-when-journalists-and-activists-get-hacked-with-government-spyware/\">Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</a>, is a “smash and grab” strategy, meaning that once spyware infects the target device, it steals as much data as it can, and then tries to remove any trace and uninstall itself. This is assumed as the spyware makers trying to protect their product and hide its activity from investigators and researchers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you are a journalist, a dissident, an academic, a human rights activist, the groups who help you may ask if you want to publicize the fact that you were attacked, but you’re not required to do so. They will be happy to help you without taking public credit for it. There may be good reasons to come out, though: To denounce the fact that a government targeted you, which may have the side effect of warning others like you of the dangers of spyware; or to expose a spyware company by showing that their customers are abusing their technology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We hope you never get one of these notifications. But we also hope that, if you do, you find this guide useful. Stay safe out there.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Kevin Hartz’s security system failed to alert him as an intruder rang his doorbell and tried to enter his San Francisco home late one night, the serial entrepreneur decided existing solutions weren’t good enough. His co-founder Jack Abraham had experienced similar frustrations at his Miami Beach residence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, they launched <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sauron.systems/\">Sauron</a> — named after the sinister, all-seeing eye from “The Lord of the Rings” — to build what they envisioned as a military-grade home security system for tech elites. The concept resonated in Bay Area circles, where crime had become a constant topic during and after the pandemic, despite San Francisco Police Department statistics showing property crime and homicide rates declining last year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup raised $18 million from executives behind Flock Safety and Palantir, defense tech investors including 8VC, Abraham’s startup lab Atomic, and Hartz’s investment firm A*. It came out of stealth exactly a year ago, promising to launch in the first quarter of 2025 with a system combining AI-driven intelligence, advanced sensors like LiDAR and thermal imaging, and 24/7 human monitoring by former military and law enforcement personnel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a year later, Sauron is still very much in development mode —  a reality that its new CEO, Maxime “Max” Bouvat-Merlin, acknowledged candidly in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After nearly nine years at Sonos, including a stint as chief product officer, Bouvat-Merlin took the helm of Sauron just last month. He’s spending his first days on the job finalizing fundamental questions: which sensors to use, how exactly the deterrence system will work, and when the company can realistically get products into customers’ homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The answer to that last question? Later in 2026 at the earliest — a significant delay from the original timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in the development phase,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “You’ll see a phased approach where we get our solution to market as a stepping stone. All the different components — our concierge service, our AI software running on servers, our smart cameras — are building blocks coming together in a plan we just put in place very recently.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Bouvat-Merlin sees striking parallels between Sauron and Sonos, which both target wealthy customers first, rely on word-of-mouth growth, and combine complex hardware with sophisticated software. “I had lunch with John MacFarlane, the founder of Sonos, a few weeks ago,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “All the topics he was thinking about when starting Sonos were exactly the same topics we’re discussing at Sauron.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both companies faced the same strategic questions: Start with super-premium customers or mass premium? Professional installation or DIY? Build everything in-house or partner with an ecosystem? “We might make different decisions, but the questions are very similar,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The security problem </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bouvat-Merlin says he was drawn to Sauron by both the mission and an opportunity to solve a real customer problem. “Securing people’s homes is important, but I also like the deterrence aspect — changing people’s minds before they make a bad decision and get into trouble,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His research showed that market leaders in premium home security have small market shares and negative Net Promoter Scores. “People are not happy with their solutions today,” he said. “There are so many false positives that when law enforcement is called, they don’t respond because they assume it’s a false alarm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is targeting customers “where safety and security is a major concern”  —  people like Hartz. The plan is to start with this premium segment, establish a reputation for supporting demanding clients, then expand to what Bouvat-Merlin calls “mass premium.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The product (that’s still taking shape)</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So what exactly is Sauron building? The answer is still evolving. The offering starts with camera pods containing multiple sensors —  “40 cameras and different types of sensors, potentially LiDAR and radar, potentially thermal,” Bouvat-Merlin said. These pods connect to servers running machine learning software for computer vision, all linked to a 24/7 concierge service staffed by former military and law enforcement personnel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Those people understand patterns,” he said. “They’re good at helping us mature our machine learning solution and train our system to detect weird behaviors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deterrence system remains somewhat vague. Options being considered include loudspeakers, flashing lights, and other methods. But Bouvat-Merlin emphasized that deterrence should begin before someone enters a property, detecting when homes are being surveilled, noticing cars circling neighborhoods multiple times, and identifying threats at each stage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The more upfront we are with deterrence, the more we can convince people this is the wrong house to rob and the wrong decision to make,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the drones mentioned when Sauron first took the wraps off its plans last year, Bouvat-Merlin declined to say much. “These are roadmap conversations. I don’t want to go too deep at this point because there are so many things we could do, but we’re such a small company,” he said. He added that, bigger picture, the focus is on growing the ecosystem through partnerships rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Timeline and business model</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With fewer than 40 employees, Sauron plans to hire just 10 to 12 more in 2026. The company will also begin working with early adopters later in 2026, with a Series A fundraise planned for mid-year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Raising a Series A is not about raising because we have to — it’s because we want to,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “I want to make sure we’re showing progress and explaining how we’ll use extra funds to accelerate growth, [including to] launch our first end-to-end product, drive customer adoption, and accelerate the roadmap.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has already attracted a significant list of prospective clients, he said, thanks to work by Sauron’s three founders, which include roboticist and engineer <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasumathi-raman/\">Vasumathi Raman</a>. “We expect the strategy initially to be word of mouth, then grow differently over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Bouvat-Merlin is cautious about growth. “I want to make sure we grow sustainably and keep the experience and service premium over time,” he said. “I want to manage growing pains as much as possible while driving profitability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The surveillance state question<br></strong><br>Facial recognition and privacy concerns loom large for a surveillance-heavy product. Bouvat-Merlin outlined one approach: a trust-based system where homeowners grant access to specific people. “I granted you access to my house, so now you’re in the trusted group. When you come, I detect it’s you and you’re allowed in. Everyone else is an unknown person,” he said, painting a picture of a likely scenario.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">License plate detection is also being considered for identifying cars circling neighborhoods multiple times. “How do we assess if that’s a threat? The ex-military and ex-law enforcement team will be really good at helping mature our machine learning solution,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, Bouvat-Merlin is confident in the opportunity ahead because of Sauron’s approach. “A lot of companies started as traditional security companies and are trying to add tech,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’re looking at it from the opposite angle — we’re a tech startup in San Francisco bringing technology to this market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sauron is also appearing on the scene as concerns rise about crime among the most wealthy. Recent high-profile incidents include a November armed robbery at the home of tech investors Lachy Groom and Joshua Buckley in San Francisco’s Mission District, where $11 million in cryptocurrency was stolen during a 90-minute ordeal involving torture and threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We see people who are wealthy attracting criminals,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’ve seen a lot of robberies in San Francisco and other major U.S. cities, sometimes at gunpoint. I don’t think the world is getting safer — there are probably more disparities between people at the top and bottom of the wealth spectrum. We see anxiety from prospective clients who are eager to get their homes secured.”<br><br>Still, much remains uncertain about Sauron’s path. The company must finalize everything from sensor configurations to manufacturing locations. (Bouvat-Merlin mentioned potentially starting in the U.S. for proximity and control, then moving to more affordable locations as volume grows.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It must also determine how to serve customers in different settings,  from estates with perimeters to dense urban residences, while maintaining premium service quality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Bouvat-Merlin says he’s focused on listening to his team, building credibility, and finalizing the strategy he’s putting in place. “I don’t demand that people trust me  — I want to show them why they should.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company expects to share more details about its products later next year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If you received an Apple gift card over the holidays and are exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047856\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png 3280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1200,539 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1280,574 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=2048,919 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=668,300 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1375,617 1375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=708,318 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need. </p>\n\n<p

Dutch entrepreneur <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nalden.net\">Nalden</a>, who co-founded the platform in 2009, says he’s deeply unhappy with changes made since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bending-spoons-acquires-file-transfer-service-wetransfer/\">Bending Spoons</a> — a Milan-based tech firm known for buying and restructuring popular apps — acquired the service last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bending Spoons doesn’t really care about people. Even though I get that it is their private equity strategy, I notice that since I left [WeTransfer] in 2019, there were a lot of updates that were basically killing the product, in my point of view,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the acquisition, WeTransfer, which now has over 70 million monthly active users, made unclear changes to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/21/wetransfers-expiry-dates-havent-gone-away-but-you-can-at-least-extend-them/\">how transfer links work</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/bending-spoons-plans-to-lay-off-75-of-wetransfer-staff-after-acquisition/\">laid off 75% of its staff</a>. This year, the company sparked controversy over employing its users’ content to train AI models and had to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/wetransfer-backtracks-on-ai-file-training-after-backlash-what-you-need-to-know/\">backtrack on changes to its terms</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon after, Nalden says creatives began reaching out to share their frustration with WeTransfer. He realized he wanted to build an alternative to WeTransfer that recaptured the original ethos of the service around simplicity. That service is called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bmrng.me\">Boomerang</a>, and users can transfer files without logging in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Why do tech companies always make things so complicated? I’ve always struggled with this, and I just wanted to offer another tool that [is entirely focused on the] user experience, its ease of use. It’s the simplicity of sharing something quickly and that just saves time.

The startup is focused on essentially one task: preventing damaging water leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers use a lot of water, and that water can present a big risk, even if a leak is small. Founder John Khazraee told TechCrunch that many data centers only have reactive solutions for water leaks. That can saddle companies with downtime and set them back millions of dollars if one occurs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee would know. He spent more than 15 years building infrastructure for IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. With MayimFlow, he’s developed a combination of IoT sensors and edge-deployed machine learning models that can detect signs of impending leaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve noticed these issues in data centers, and the only solution they had was: ‘when the leak happens, we find out,’” he said in an interview. “Now you have to spend a lot of money to go remediate the situation. Now you got to turn off the servers. Now the data is being disrupted. So I decided to do something about it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee assembled a small team with plenty of experience to take on this challenge. Jim Wong, MayimFlow’s chief strategy officer, has spent decades working with data centers. Chief technology officer Ray Lok has carved out a career in water management and IoT infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the scariest consequences of unnoticed water leaks, there’s an element of frugality to what Khazraee is trying to do with MayimFlow, which he said comes from his childhood.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I grew up in a very, you know, I don’t want to say the word ‘poor’ family, but we weren’t the most well-off family,” he said. “And my dad would always, when I was taking a shower, tell me, ‘Hey, you’re in the shower too long. Are you singing in there?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As he grew up, Khazraee said he found himself always thinking about how to make things more efficient — especially as he studied to become an engineer. In college, he worked at a facility that collected frying oil from restaurants and converted it to biodiesel. It was a “messy job,” he said, but he liked the end result. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee is now trying to mix this penchant for frugality with the experience of his team. He believes they can give data center operators 24 to 48 hours of advanced warning that repairs will be needed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MayimFlow has collected a glut of sample data from various industrial water systems that allow them to make these kinds of predictions, he said. The company can provide sensors that can help monitor a water system or plug its machine learning models into existing ones if companies already have similar hardware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee said he wants to bring this solution beyond data centers to commercial buildings, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, and possibly even utilities. In his eyes, any company that wants to spot leaks early, or optimize water usage, could be a customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee thinks it’s such a big opportunity he’s turned down roles at multiple big tech companies while building MayimFlow over the last two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really believe in the vision. I believe in the impact that we’re making,” he said. “Water is becoming one of those big issues in our world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

I didn’t opt for an Apple Watch because I wasn’t constantly active, I didn’t feel the need to check my notifications, and I didn’t want to think about charging the watch every day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, I got a chance to test the new Google Pixel Watch 4, which made me feel like I might start wearing smartwatches again. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have always had a soft spot for circular watches. One of the first smartwatches I owned was the Moto 360, and I loved its rounded design.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel Watch 4 has a curved domed Actua 360 display with thinner bezels as compared to last year’s watch. I have the 41 mm watch as the test unit, but I would personally opt for the 45mm size for battery and a bigger display. The display is also brighter with 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and that makes it easier to use in daylight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The battery life is great on the Pixel Watch 4, even with the smaller size. I have managed to get more than a day’s use out of the watch on those days when I have lighter activities.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078508\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the Pixel Watch 4 has a proprietary charger where you can place the watch on the cradle like a puck, the charging speed makes up for it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google advertises that you can charge this watch from 0% to 50% in 15 minutes and from 0% to 100% in 45 minutes. While the real-life timing doesn’t exactly match these numbers, I saw charging times that came close to these figures. The advantage of this rapid charging is that you can always put your watch to charge when you are making a coffee or doing a quick chore within the house, and get enough juice to last you throughout the day.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fitness-and-software\">Fitness and software</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I largely used the Google Pixel Watch 4 to track my pickleball sessions and walking. Apart from calorie burns, there were no particular insights into sports-related movement. For the last 15 days, I started going to a gym, and apart from the treadmill and elliptical mode, there aren’t any specialized modes for particular gym equipment. Instead, you have to select from options for things like core training, weights, or a general workout mode, based on the workout you are doing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The watch does have more features for someone who runs — but that’s not possible in Delhi weather with terrible AQI right now. It also detects cardio workouts after 15 minutes of continuous activities, but while walking, these have been hit or miss for me. Another measure that has been off for me has been floor count. On days, I’ve walked to a cafe, I’ve seen a very high count for that, and on days I have gone up to my terrace multiple times, the number of floors climbed is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I am not someone who used to wear my watch or band to sleep. With the Pixel Watch 4, I had to mentally train myself to keep the watch on so I could get a better understanding of sleep and readiness scores. After a few weeks of usage, I regularly wore my watch to sleep. However, you don’t get additional or actionable insights related to sleep or readiness score on the watch in the daily summary. You do get suggestions on the Fitbit app related to readiness, but that’s about it. With fitness apps adding more AI to their apps, Google needs to step up its game.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?w=311\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078520\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=137,300 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=768,1681 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=311,680 311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=548,1200 548w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=585,1280 585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=196,430 196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=329,720 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=411,900 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=702,1536 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=936,2048 936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=305,668 305w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=171,375 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=282,617 282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=243,531 243w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Screenshot by Techcrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s new Material UI design for the watch is refreshing and matches the theme on my Pixel Fold. The weather app is very nice to look at for both hourly and day forecasts. My one gripe is that I wish the exercise app allowed for more than three kinds of workouts to be available through quick start. I could raise my watch to talk to Gemini, which is neat, but beyond starting timers, asking for occasional sports updates, and starting a workout, I have not needed Gemini to be ever-present for me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have been a fan of the recent Pixel Watch 4 update that lets me use the pinch gesture to dismiss notifications, play or pause videos or music, or even move my wrist to dismiss calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The gripes I had about the watch didn’t bother me in daily usage. The display is fantastic, the software and fitness experience overall are great, and the display, along with the new design, is an upgrade from the last generation. However, the thing that drew me the most to the watch and made me stick to it is the combo of battery life and fast charging. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All in all, the Pixel Watch 4 is one of the best Android smartwatches around.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The number of startup funding rounds fell by nearly 39% from a year earlier, to 1,518 deals, according to Tracxn. Total funding slipped more modestly — down just over 17% to $10.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That pullback was not uniform. Seed-stage funding fell sharply to $1.1 billion in 2025, down 30% from 2024, as investors cut back on more experimental bets. Late-stage funding also cooled, slipping to $5.5 billion, a 26% decline from last year, amid tougher scrutiny of scale, profitability, and exit prospects. However, early-stage funding proved more resilient, rising to $3.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079057\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,1000 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,1067 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,358 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,600 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,750 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,667 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1536,1280 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,557 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=450,375 450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=740,617 740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=637,531 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The capital deployment focus has increased towards early-stage startups,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn, pointing to growing confidence in founders who can demonstrate stronger product–market fit, revenue visibility and unit economics in a tighter funding environment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-ai-quest\">The AI quest</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nowhere was that recalibration clearer than in AI, as AI startups in India raised just over $643 million across 100 deals in 2025, a modest 4.1% increase from a year earlier, per Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. The capital was mainly spread across early and early-growth stages. Early-stage AI funding totaled $273.3 million, while late-stage rounds raised $260 million, reflecting investor preference for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">application-led businesses</a> over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">capital-intensive model development</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was in sharp contrast to the U.S., where AI funding in 2025 surged past $121 billion across 765 rounds, per Tracxn, a 141% jump from 2024, and was overwhelmingly dominated by late-stage deals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t yet have an AI-first company in India, which is $40–$50 million of revenue, if not $100 million, in a year’s time frame, and that is globally happening,” said Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, Swaroop told TechCrunch, lacks large foundational model companies and will take time to build the research depth, talent pipeline, and patient capital needed to compete at that layer — making application-led AI and adjacent deep-tech areas a more realistic focus in the near term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This pragmatism has shaped where investors are placing longer-term bets outside core AI. Venture capital is increasingly flowing into manufacturing and deep-tech sectors. These are some of the areas where India faces less global capital competition and has clear advantages in talent, cost structures, and customer access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/here-are-the-49-us-ai-startups-that-have-raised-100m-or-more-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">absorbs a significant share of investor attention</a>, capital in India arguably remains more evenly distributed than in the U.S., with substantial funding still flowing into consumer, manufacturing, fintech, and deep-tech startups. Swaroop noted that advanced manufacturing in particular has emerged as a long-term opportunity, with the number of such startups increasing nearly tenfold over the past four to five years — an area he described as a clear “right to win” for India given lower global capital competition.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, said AI startups accounted for roughly 30–40% of deals in India in 2025, but pointed to a parallel surge in consumer-facing companies as changing behaviour among India’s urban population creates demand for faster, more on-demand services — from quick commerce to household services — categories that play to India’s scale and density rather than Silicon Valley–style capital intensity.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-versus-the-u-s\">India versus the U.S.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data from PitchBook shows a stark divergence in capital deployment between India and the U.S. in 2025. U.S. venture funding surged to $89.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone, according to PitchBook data up to December 23, compared with about $4.2 billion raised by Indian startups over the same period.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079058\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=768,581 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=680,515 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1200,908 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1280,969 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=430,325 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=720,545 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=900,681 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=800,605 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1536,1162 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=668,506 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=496,375 496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=815,617 815w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=702,531 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, that gap does not tell the whole story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightspeed’s Taneja cautioned against drawing direct parallels between India and the U.S., arguing that differences in population density, labour costs, and consumer behaviour shape which business models can scale. Categories such as quick commerce and on-demand services have found far greater traction in India than in the U.S., reflecting local economics rather than any lack of ambition among founders or investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, Lightspeed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lightspeed-raises-record-9b-in-fresh-capital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $9 billion in fresh capital</a> with a strong focus on AI, but Taneja said the move does not signal a wholesale shift in the firm’s India strategy. The U.S. fund, he noted, is geared toward a different market and maturity cycle, while Lightspeed’s India arm will continue backing consumer startups alongside selectively exploring AI opportunities shaped by local demand rather than global capital intensity.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nuances-in-india-s-startup-ecosystem\">Nuances in India’s startup ecosystem</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s startup ecosystem also saw funding for women-led startups tighten. Capital invested in women-founded tech startups held relatively steady at about $1 billion in 2025, down 3% from a year earlier, according to Tracxn’s report. Still, that headline figure masked a sharper pullback beneath the surface. The number of funding rounds in women-founded startups fell by 40%, while their first-time funded counterparts declined by 36%.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079059\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg 1510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,89 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,227 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,201 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,354 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,378 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,127 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,213 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,266 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,236 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,197 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1440,425 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=708,209 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,15 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1510px) 100vw, 1510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">India’s women-led startups saw a 3% dip in funding in 2025</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, investor participation narrowed sharply as selectivity increased, with about 3,170 investors taking part in funding rounds in India this year, a 53% drop from roughly 6,800 a year earlier, according to Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. India-based investors accounted for nearly half of that activity, with around 1,500 domestic funds and angels participating — a sign that local capital played a more prominent role as global investors turned cautious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activity also became more concentrated among a smaller group of repeat backers. Inflection Point Ventures emerged as the most active investor, participating in 36 funding rounds, followed by Accel with 34, Tracxn data shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government’s participation in the startup ecosystem became more visible in 2025. New Delhi announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/india-pledges-fresh-billion-for-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.15 billion Fund of Funds</a> in January to expand capital access for startups, followed by a ₹1 trillion ($12 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation scheme aimed at areas such as energy transition, quantum computing, robotics, space technology, biotech, and AI, using a mix of long-term loans, equity infusions and allocations to deep-tech funds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That push has begun to catalyze private capital as well. The government’s growing involvement helped spur a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/nvidia-qualcomm-join-u-s-indian-vcs-to-help-build-indias-next-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nearly $2 billion commitment</a> from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/u-s-and-indian-vcs-just-formed-a-1b-alliance-to-fund-indias-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. and Indian venture capital and private equity firms</a>, including Accel, Blume Ventures, and Celesta Capital, to back deep-tech startups — an effort that also brought Nvidia on board as an adviser and drew Qualcomm Ventures. Furthermore, the Indian government also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/india-eyes-global-quantum-computer-push-and-qpiai-is-its-chosen-vehicle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">co-led a $32 million funding</a> for quantum computing startup QpiAI earlier this year — a rare federal move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This growing state involvement has helped ease a risk long flagged by investors: regulatory uncertainty. “One of the biggest risks you don’t want to underwrite is what happens if regulation changes,” said Taneja of Lightspeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As government entities become more familiar with the startup ecosystem, Taneja added, policy is more likely to evolve alongside it — reducing uncertainty for investors backing companies with longer development cycles.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-exits-in-india\">Exits in India</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reduced uncertainty has already started to show up in exit markets to some extent. India saw a steady pipeline of technology IPOs over the past two years, with 42 tech companies going public in 2025, up 17% from 36 in 2024, per Tracxn. Much of the demand for those listings has come from domestic institutional and retail investors, easing long-standing concerns that Indian startup exits depend too heavily on foreign capital. M&amp;A activity also picked up, with acquisitions rising 7% year-over-year to 136 deals, Tracxn data shows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop of Accel said investors had long worried that India’s public markets were mainly sustained by foreign capital, raising questions about exit durability during global downturns. “This year has disproven that,” he said, pointing to the growing role of domestic investors in absorbing technology listings — a shift that has made exits more predictable and reduced reliance on volatile overseas flows.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079060\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,600 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,531 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,938 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,1000 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,336 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,563 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,703 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,625 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1536,1200 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,522 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=480,375 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=790,617 790w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s unicorn pipeline in 2025 also reflected that shift toward restraint. While the number of new unicorns remained flat year over year, Indian startups reached $1 billion valuations with less capital, fewer funding rounds, and a smaller pool of institutional investors, pointing to a more measured path to scale compared with both previous years and global peers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Challenges remain as India heads into 2026, particularly around how it positions itself in the global race for AI and whether late-stage funding can deepen without relying on outsized capital inflows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even so, the shifts seen in 2025 point to a startup ecosystem that is maturing rather than retreating — one where capital is being deployed more deliberately, exits are becoming more predictable, and domestic market dynamics increasingly shape its growth. For investors, India is emerging less as a substitute for developed markets and more as a complementary arena with its own risk profile, timelines, and opportunities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
