And like Sora, Seedance quickly drew criticism for an apparent lack of guardrails around the ability to create videos using the likeness of real people, as well as studios’ intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After one X user <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134\">posted a brief video</a> showing Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, which they said was created by “a 2 line prompt in seedance 2,” “Deadpool” screenwriter <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/RhettReese/status/2021446414337966098\">Rhett Reese responded</a>, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Motion Picture Association soon issued <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.motionpictures.org/press/motion-picture-association-calls-for-bytedance-to-cease-seedance-2-0-infringing-activity/\">a statement</a> from CEO Charles Rivkin demanding that ByteDance “immediately cease its infringing activity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,” Rivkin said. “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Human Artistry Campaign — an initiative backed by Hollywood unions and trade groups — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/disneys-openai-deal-is-exclusive-for-just-one-year-then-its-open-season/\">condemned Seedance 2.0</a> as “an attack one very creator around the world,” while <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-statement-seedance-20\">the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA said</a> it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by Bytedance’s new AI video model Seedance 2.0.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seedance videos have apparently featured Disney-owned characters such as Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and Grogu, better known as Baby Yoda, prompting the company to take legal action. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/disney-bytedance-seedance\">Axios reports that Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter</a> accusing ByteDance of a “virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP”and claiming the Chinese company is “hijacking Disney’s characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Disney isn’t necessarily opposed to working with AI companies — while it has reportedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-hits-google-with-cease-and-desist-claiming-massive-copyright-infringement/\">sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google</a> over similar issues, it’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/disneys-openai-deal-is-exclusive-for-just-one-year-then-its-open-season/\">signed a three-year licensing deal with OpenAI</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to ByteDance for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Barton teamed up with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fiduciaai.com/\">Fiducia AI </a>to create a multilingual AI agent (built with IBM Watsonx on IBM Cloud) to help guests identify pieces of the collection and try them on virtually. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch caught up with Barton and Ganesh Harinath, the founder and CEO of Fiducia AI, before the show to learn more about the presentation. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one, Barton said technology is baked into how she thinks. She likes playing with the real and the unreal, and found the idea of using AI-like set design, “a portal into the collection’s world, rather than ‘AI for AI’s sake,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today, tech is a tool for expanding the world around the clothes, how they are presented, and how people enter the story, and how we create that moment when your eyes do a double-take,” she told TechCrunch, adding that the goal for this collection was to create a sense of curiosity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harinath said his company used IBM watsonx, IBM Cloud, and IBM Cloud Object Storage to help pull off Barton’s presentation. It was a production-grade activation with a Visual AI lens (built with IBM watsonx) that detects pieces from Barton’s new collection. It can answer questions in any language via voice and text and offers photorealistic virtual reality try-ons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The hardest work wasn’t model tuning; it was orchestration,” he told TechCrunch. This isn’t the first time Barton has put a technological spin on her fashion — last season, she <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-nyfw-ai/\">experimented with AI models</a>, also in collaboration with Fiduicia AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At fashion week, there was some chatter about whether brands — and, if so, which ones — would be using technology and artificial intelligence. Barton thinks many brands are using AI, though quietly, mainly in operations. “Maybe fewer are using it publicly because of the potential reputational risk,” she said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It rhymes a bit with the early days when many big fashion names were nervous about starting websites. “Then it became inevitable, and eventually the question shifted from ‘should we be online’ to ‘is our online presence any good?’” she said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3093162\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KateBarton-IBM-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kate Barton</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harinath added that, though many brands are experimenting with AI, much of its deployment remains at the surface level — such as chatbots, content generation, and internal productivity tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Barton sees a world of better prototyping, better visualization, smarter production decisions, and more immersive ways to experience fashion, without replacing the humans who “actually make it worth wearing.” Change will only come with more clarity, she said, with “clear discourse, clear licensing, clear credit, and a shared understanding that human creativity is not an annoying overhead cost.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If the technology is used to erase people, I am not into it,” she said, adding that audiences are smarter than we think. “They can tell the difference between invention and avoidance.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the tension, AI is becoming more routine, and there will come a day when shows like Barton’s are just part of the norm. Harinath thinks AI in fashion will be normalized by 2028, and by 2023, he sees it becoming embedded into the operational core of retail. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of this technology already exists — the differentiator now is assembling the right partners and building teams that can operationalize it responsibly,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dee Waddell, Global Head of Consumer, Travel and Transportation Industries at IBM Consulting, agreed. “When inspiration, product intelligence, and engagement are connected in real time, AI moves from being a feature to becoming a growth engine that drives measurable competitive advantage,” Waddell told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But until then, there is this show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The most exciting future for fashion is not automated fashion,” Barton said. “It is fashion that uses new tools to heighten craft, deepen storytelling, and bring more people into the experience, without flattening the people who make it.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A previous iteration of the program, launched in 2016, committed ₹100 billion to 145 private funds that have invested more than ₹255 billion (about $2.8 billion) in over 1,370 startups, according to official data <a href=\"http://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2227988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released</a> on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The program is structured as a fund of funds, a common venture capital model in which governments back startups indirectly by committing capital to private investment firms. It is designed to take a more targeted approach than its 2016 counterpart, focusing on deep-tech and manufacturing startups that typically require longer time horizons and larger amounts of capital, while also backing early-stage founders, expanding investment beyond major cities and strengthening India’s domestic venture capital industry, particularly smaller funds, per the Indian government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the announcement on Saturday, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw highlighted the scale of India’s startup expansion, pointing to figures shown on a presentation slide indicating the number of startups has grown from fewer than 500 in 2016 to more than 200,000 today. The slide said more than 49,000 startups were registered in 2025 alone, the highest annual total on record.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cabinet approval follows recent changes to India’s startup rules aimed at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/india-has-changed-its-startup-rules-for-deep-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">easing pressure on deep-tech companies</a>. New Delhi doubled the period for which such firms are classified as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion, or about $33 million, up from ₹1 billion previously.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The approval comes just ahead of the government-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">India AI Impact Summit</a>, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia are set to participate alongside Indian corporates such as Reliance Industries and Tata Group. India, the world’s most populous country and one of its largest internet markets with more than a billion online users, has become an increasingly attractive arena for global tech companies looking to expand their user base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, private capital has become harder to secure. India’s startup ecosystem <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/27/india-startup-funding-hits-11b-in-2025-as-investors-grow-more-selective/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $10.5 billion in 2025</a>, down just over 17% from a year earlier, even as investors grew more selective and sharply reduced the number of deals. The number of funding rounds fell nearly 39% to 1,518 transactions, according to data from Tracxn.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vaishnaw said the new venture capital program would remain flexible, adding that “extensive consultations have taken place with all stakeholders.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The store is located in Bengaluru, where the company says a large chunk of its user base is concentrated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new, two-story location will showcase Nothing’s products and other projects. Customers will also be able to buy hardware products and other merchandise from the store and have select items customized.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We wanted to create a fun space,” the company’s co-founder and CEO Carl Pei said. “It’s kind of inspired by all the parts that are related to the brand. For instance, the factory: if you buy a product, there’s like a production line where the product comes out. We also show machines where phones go through testing, like USB port testing or water resistance testing. So we just wanted to bring that world together.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The store will feature products from both Nothing and CMF, its budget brand, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/smartphone-maker-nothing-to-spin-off-its-affordable-cmf-brand/\">which it spun off last year</a>. Notably, CMF is headquartered in India and has a joint venture with local Indian ODM (original design manufacturer), Optiemus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pei mentioned that both brands are differentiated in terms of the products they offer, which fall into different price ranges, as well as the audiences they target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nothing is more niche with a higher price. CMF is more [targeted toward] mass [market]. You know it’s mass, but it’s not just off-the-shelf rebrand products that usually [appear] in this price point. They are also products that we put a lot of care into,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has been Nothing’s strongest market, with over 2% of the smartphone market share, the research firm IDC told TechCrunch last year. It also noted that Nothing was the fastest-growing brand in the country in Q2 2025, with 85% growth in shipments year-over-year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other hardware makers are building aspirational retail stores in India, too. For instance, Apple is set to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-to-open-its-sixth-store-in-borivali-on-february-26/articleshow/128290316.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">open its sixth store in the country this month</a>, situated in Borivali, a suburb of Mumbai.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the first Nothing store outside of London, where the company is headquartered. The startup said that it plans to open two more stores in Tokyo and New York, but didn’t provide timelines for the openings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/nothing-closes-200m-series-c-led-by-tiger-global-plans-ai-first-device-launch/\">$200 million in Series C funding at a $1.3 billion valuation last year, led by Tiger Global,</a> along with investors like GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF, and Tapestry.

Security researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaw after identifying insecure “super admin” application programming interfaces on DavaIndia’s website and privately shared details with Indian cybersecurity authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bug is now fixed, and Zveare <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://eaton-works.com/2026/02/13/dava-india-hack/\">disclosed his findings</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposure comes as Zota Healthcare rapidly scales DavaIndia Pharmacy’s retail business. The Gujarat-headquartered company operates more than 2,300 DavaIndia stores across India, including <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/capital-market-news/zota-health-care-gains-after-adding-276-davaindia-stores-in-q3-fy26-126010200369_1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">276 new outlets</a> announced in January, and plans to <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-in/lifestyle/pets-animals/zota-health-care-to-pump-rs-350-crore-into-dawa-india-plans-1-500-stores-in-two-years/ar-AA1SOVYR?apiversion=v2&amp;domshim=1&amp;noservercache=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">add another 1,200 to 1,500</a> over the next two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare told TechCrunch that the flaw stemmed from insecure admin interfaces, which allowed unauthenticated users to create “super admin” accounts with high privileges. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that level of access, an attacker could view thousands of online orders containing customer information, modify product listings and prices, create discount coupons, and change settings governing whether certain medicines required a prescription, the researcher said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on system timestamps, Zveare said the vulnerable administrative interfaces appeared to have been live since late 2024. The access exposed nearly 17,000 online orders and administrative controls spanning 883 stores, he said, allowing changes to product pricing, prescription requirements, and promotional discounts.

Exposure of such data, even without evidence of misuse, carries heightened privacy and patient-safety risks compared with other consumer information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Customer information was linked to their orders,” said Zveare. “This includes name, phone numbers, email IDs, mailing addresses, total amount paid, and the products purchased.

It knows you. It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company separately said it is testing a new feature that lets users search and ask questions about properties and locations using natural language queries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Airbnb offers an LLM-powered customer service bot, for some personalization, and communications. The new AI search feature is expected to “evolve into a more comprehensive and intuitive search experience that extends through the trip.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Questioned by analyst whether Airbnb would roll out sponsored property slots within AI search, Chesky said the company wants to get the design and user experience right first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI search is live to a very small percentage of traffic right now. We are doing a lot of experimentation. Over time, we are gonna be experimenting with making AI search more conversational, integrating it into more than the trip, and, eventually, we will be looking at sponsor listings as a result of that,” Chesky said, adding that Airbnb would consider designing an ad unit that fits the conversational search flow.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chesky said Airbnb plans to tap the AI expertise of its new CTO, Ahmad Al-Dahle (he worked on Meta’s  Llama models previously), to use its trove of identity and review data to make the app more useful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb claimed its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/airbnb-is-quietly-rolling-out-an-ai-customer-service-bot-in-the-us/\">AI-powered customer support</a> bot, launched in North America last year, now handles a third of customer problems without needing any human intervention. Chesky noted there are plans to enable customers to call the AI bot for support, and expand language coverage to customer support as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A year from now, if we are successful, significantly more than 30% of tickets will be handled by a custom service agent, in many more languages, in all the languages where we have live agents. AI customer service will not only be chat, it will be voice,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also thinking about increasing AI usage internally. Airbnb said 80% of its engineers use AI tools, but the goal is to get to 100%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb reported better-than-expected revenue of $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, up 12% from a year earlier. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If successful, the company believes that in a year’s time, more than 30% of its total customer support tickets will be handled by AI voice and chat in all the languages where it also employs a human customer service agent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think this is going to be massive because not only does this reduce the cost base of Airbnb customer service, but the quality of service is going to be a huge step change,” CEO Brian Chesky said during the company’s <a href=\"https://investors.airbnb.com/press-releases/news-details/2026/Airbnb-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fourth-quarter earnings</a> call this week. This seems to suggest he believes the AI would do a better job than its human counterparts in resolving some issues.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also touted its recent hire of CTO Ahmad Al-Dahle, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/12/airbnb-abnb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">poached from Meta</a> for his AI expertise, and its plans to create an AI-native experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With his guidance, Chesky said that Airbnb was poised to introduce an app that doesn’t just search for you, but one that “knows you.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” Chesky explained, adding that’s why Airbnb brought Al-Dahle on board. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ahmad is one of the world’s leading AI experts. He spent 16 years at Apple, and most recently led the generative AI team at Meta that built the Llama models. He’s an expert at pairing massive technical scale with world-class design, which is exactly how we’re going to transform the Airbnb experience,” Chesky noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other businesses poised for disruption by AI, Airbnb’s leadership is pushing the idea that it has a unique database and product that other AI chatbots can’t replicate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A chatbot doesn’t have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can’t message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do,” Chesky told analysts during the earnings call. Instead, he pitched the idea of layering AI over the Airbnb experience, which he claimed would help to accelerate growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company forecast revenue growth would be in the “low double digits” this year, after pulling in $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/q4-airbnb-abnb-earnings-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">above estimates </a>of $2.72 billion. This quarter, it expects revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $2.53 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors still wanted to know if AI platforms could be a risk in the long-term, assuming they moved into the short-term rentals market. Chesky, however, pushed back at that idea, saying that Airbnb isn’t just the consumer-facing app; it’s also the host app, the customer service, and the protections it offers, like insurance and user verifications.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve built this over 18 years. We handle more than $100 billion in payments through the platform,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, AI chatbots serve a function similar to search, in that they deliver top-of-funnel traffic, he noted. That traffic also converts at a higher rate than traffic from Google, Chesky pointed out, suggesting that the shift to AI would benefit Airbnb.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is already using AI to power its search, with the feature now enabled for a “very small percentage” of Airbnb’s traffic, while it experiments with making its search more conversational. Later, the company plans to integrate sponsored listings within search.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Spotify this week told investors its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/spotify-says-its-best-developers-havent-written-a-line-of-code-since-december-thanks-to-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best developers hadn’t written a single line of code</a> since December, thanks to AI, Airbnb offered a more high-level metric on its own internal AI adoption. The company said that 80% of its engineers now use AI tools, and it’s working to get that to 100% soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga did not respond to a request for comment and to provide more information, such as the total number of customers affected. The company says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#multi-factor-authentication\">multi-factor authentication</a>, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords.

The SEC’s FOIA department said it had identified “approximately 21.7 gigabytes of electronically maintained records” related to the investigation. The agency doesn’t typically make records available if investigations are still open, and it explained in a follow-up email that it “was closed in September 2025.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how far the investigation progressed. The SEC <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/fisker-faces-sec-investigation-as-bankruptcy-case-drags-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revealed the existence of the probe</a> in an October 2024 filing in Fisker’s bankruptcy case. The agency wrote at the time that it had sent subpoenas to the company and that it may need to “request or subpoena additional documents in the future relating to its ongoing investigation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment.

The SEC initiated 313 enforcement actions in 2025 — the lowest in a decade and down 27% from the the final year of President Biden’s term, according to <a href=\"https://www.paulweiss.com/media/mxhbfcx4/sec_enforcement_2025_year_in_review.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an analysis by law firm Paul, Weiss</a>. Only four of those enforcement actions were against public companies. Total monetary settlements fell 45% from 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fisker was one of the last remaining electric vehicle startups under investigation by the SEC. Over the last few years, the agency settled fraud or other charges brought against <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikola-agrees-83m-sec-settlement-213634419.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nikola</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/lordstown-motors-sec-charged-misleading-investors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lordstown Motors</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/30/ev-company-canoo-agrees-to-1-5m-settlement-with-sec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Canoo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-sec-settles-fraud-charges-against-hyzon-motors-over-misleading-investors-2023-09-26/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hyzon Motors</a>, and others. In 2023, it <a href=\"https://www.torquenews.com/15975/secs-lucid-investigation-closed-no-wrongdoing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closed an investigation</a> into Lucid Motors without a lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The only known active investigation remaining into an electric vehicle startup is the one related to Faraday Future, which is now nearly four years old. In July 2025, the SEC <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/faraday-future-faces-potential-sec-enforcement-action-after-three-year-probe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sent Faraday and multiple executives</a> “Wells notices,” or letters that inform a subject that the investigators recommend an enforcement action. No action has been taken since those letters were sent, though, and Faraday’s own regulatory filings indicate it has not yet responded to the Wells notices. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fisker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/ev-startup-fisker-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed for bankruptcy in June 2024</a> amid a raft of problems with its first EV, the Ocean SUV.

The move highlights New Delhi’s selective engagement with Chinese-linked tech platforms years after it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">imposed sweeping bans</a> on consumer apps and games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, the Indian government’s Startup India initiative <a href=\"https://x.com/startupindia/status/2021522797496005096\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the collaboration with Alibaba.com to identify and support Indian startups that can help onboard and scale Indian exporters on the group’s global B2B platform. The program offers commissions and technical support to those startups to assist small manufacturers and traders in reaching overseas markets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new partnership arrives after years of strained India–China relations. New Delhi <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">banned dozens of Chinese-linked apps</a> in 2020 following a deadly border clash, including major platforms such as TikTok, PUBG Mobile, and AliExpress, an e-commerce app operated by Alibaba Group. Those restrictions remain in place, making the Indian government’s public collaboration with Alibaba’s export-focused platform a carefully circumscribed form of engagement rather than a broader policy reset.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s export ambitions are closely tied to its small businesses and the platforms they use to reach overseas markets. Micro, small, and medium enterprises account for <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2219984\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nearly half of the country’s exports</a> and about 31% of GDP, according to the Indian government’s latest Economic Survey, underlining why New Delhi has focused on expanding digital market access for smaller firms through global B2B channels, including Alibaba.com.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alibaba.com’s B2B platform connects more than 50 million active buyers across over 200 countries and regions, said Rocky Lu, head of India business at the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Alibaba.com has been active in India for over two decades, and we remain dedicated to our core mission of empowering MSMEs to scale their businesses globally,” Lu told TechCrunch. “Our focus continues to be on leveraging our digital infrastructure to help ‘Made in India’ products reach an international audience through digital transformation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu did not confirm whether the Startup India initiative marks Alibaba.com’s first direct partnership with India’s federal government since 2020. He said, however, that the company has “maintained a consistent cadence of engagement with various government and semi-government bodies integral to the Indian export ecosystem,” including through digital training programs for MSMEs and collaborations with export promotion councils.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership reflects India’s differentiated approach toward China, maintaining restrictions in strategic and security-sensitive sectors while allowing economic engagement where there is clear benefit, said Kazim Rizvi, founding director of the New Delhi-based public policy think tank The Dialogue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Going forward, regulatory clarity will be important,” Rizvi told TechCrunch. “Predictable policy environments will help ensure that startups feel confident participating in such initiatives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government seems to be drawing a distinction between export-focused platforms and consumer-facing Chinese apps, said George Chen, partner and co-chair of the digital practice at The Asia Group, a Washington-based consultancy that advises companies on policy and geopolitical risks across Asia. Chen, who previously served as a regional public policy director at Meta, said New Delhi sees value in Alibaba’s role in supporting B2B exports, particularly given the platform’s reach in markets such as Africa, which could help Indian exporters diversify their global sales.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India appears to be drawing lessons from China’s approach to digital platforms, Chen told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“China bans foreign apps like Facebook and Instagram for Chinese individual users but still allows Facebook and Google to do business with Chinese companies, especially exporters who rely on those platforms to sell products abroad,” Chen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Startup India collaboration follows other recent steps by Alibaba.com to expand export-focused services in India. In June 2025, the company <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/alibabacom-launches-trade-assurance-in-india-to-empower-smes-302494114.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched</a> its Trade Assurance program in the country, aimed at helping Indian small and medium-sized exporters manage risks in cross-border transactions through payment protection and dispute-resolution tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The developments also come as India and China show tentative signs of improved engagement in multilateral technology forums, with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/china-india-ai-summit-improving-relations-with-new-delhi.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chinese representatives expected to attend</a> the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">India AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi next week. Indian officials, however, have not indicated any change to restrictions on Chinese consumer technology platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is also nearing the milestone of 100 million streaming households, though it has decided to report this figure less frequently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Financially, Roku delivered an impressive quarter, posting net income of $80.5 million, a rebound from a $35.5 million loss in the same period last year. Total revenue for Q4 2025 reached $1.4 billion, representing a 16% year-over-year increase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, Roku is optimistic, projecting total net revenue of $5.5 billion and gross profit of $2.4 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In 2023, our priority was to rightsize our cost structure and reach adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2024, and we achieved that goal a full year ahead of schedule,” Wood told investors during the call yesterday afternoon. “Looking ahead to 2026 and beyond, we are confident in our ability to sustain double-digit platform revenue growth while continuing to grow profitability.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Date Drop pairs students with potential dates once per week based on their responses to a questionnaire.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Stanford whiz kid is trying to disrupt an established industry from his Palo Alto dorm? <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/fizz-ceo-on-why-anonymous-social-is-winning-with-gen-z/\">Stop me</a> if <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2022/09/28/marriage-pact-secures-5-million-in-seed-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">you’ve heard this</a> one <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/phoebe-gates-and-sophia-kiannis-phia-raises-35m-to-make-shopping-fun-again/\">before</a>! But young adults are deeply <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-app-fatigue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disillusioned</a> with the frustrating, demoralizing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/tinder-u-gets-new-features-aimed-at-enhancing-online-dating-for-college-students/\">state of online dating</a>. Why not try something different?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over 5,000 students at Stanford have given Date Drop a try since its launch in the fall. It has also rolled out at 10 more schools, including MIT, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania, and Weng says he wants to roll out Date Drop more broadly in some cities this summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our matches convert to actual dates at about 10x the rate of Tinder,” Weng told TechCrunch. “Instead of swiping, we get to know each person deeply and send them one compatible match per week.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At first, Weng didn’t intend to turn Date Drop into the foundation of a startup. Then, a close friend of his met their partner via Date Drop. “That was when I got the sense that this was less of a project,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Weng thinks of Date Drop as just the first service from his startup, The <a href=\"https://www.relationship.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Relationship Company</a>, which is a public benefit corporation — a type of company legally required to consider social impact alongside profits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This started as something I just wanted to exist on campus, and it became a company because people kept on asking for it in their schools and I needed resources to do that,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Already, Weng has raised “a few million” from some angel investors, including Zynga founder and early Facebook backer Mark Pincus, who has taught business courses at Stanford (including to Weng). Andy Chen, a former partner at Coatue, and Elad Gil, an early backer of Airbnb, Stripe, and Pinterest, also invested in The Relationship Company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The long-term vision at The Relationship Company is about facilitating all meaningful relationships: friendships, professional connections, community, events,” Weng said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s par for the course to use algorithms to predict if users of a dating service may be compatible with one another — that’s how dating apps work. But Weng says his model is more geared toward forging long-term connections, with 95% of Date Drop users saying they’re interested in relationships.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3092767\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png 3273w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Date Drop</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weng explains that there are two core elements at play. First, the questionnaire needs to be thorough enough to capture a real picture of who someone is. “We do that through the questions, open-ended responses, a voice conversation, and other data that the users provide,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The next challenge is compatibility prediction. “Because we help people plan dates, we have data on which matches actually work out. So we have a model trained on real-world outcomes,” he said. “Once you have those two components, the actual matching is standard stuff from matching theory literature.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently pursuing a computer science master’s degree at Stanford, Weng has oriented his education around the economic and mathematical concepts of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_theory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">matching</a>. As a Stanford undergrad, he created his own major to study humans, matching, and incentives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I started to see how matching shapes so much of our lives,” Weng told TechCrunch. “Who your life partner is, who your friends are, what college you go to, which company you work for are all matching problems.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond his technical education, Weng found an unexpected class useful for learning to manage a startup: “Intro to Clown.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A core principle of clowning is that clowns are failures, and instead of fearing failure, they revel in it,” he said. “As a product builder, your entire journey is just repeatedly failing and getting back up. Clown class was a wonderful microcosm of that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, The Relationship Company has two employees besides Weng, along with 12 students who serve as campus ambassadors. Because their work revolves around forging matches, Weng has extended that mindset to how he manages the company. He offers employees a $100 monthly “relationship stipend,” which they can spend on dates, gifts, experiences, or anything that helps them deepen an important relationship of any sort.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Relationships are the single most important factor in a person’s life,” Weng said. “There’s also great research showing that money spent on other people makes you happier than money spent on yourself.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weng’s fascination with how people form relationships has also informed how he goes about his day-to-day life.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Date Drop has shown me how many interesting people are out there that you’d never encounter through your normal routines,” he said. “It’s made me more open to people I wouldn’t have crossed paths with otherwise.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This unfortunately required parting ways with some people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that the company is “hiring aggressively” and closed with a quintessentially Musk pitch: “Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Losing half your co-founders in a relatively short period raises questions, and Musk’s comments seem designed to control the narrative, reframing the exits as necessary rather than a problem for the outfit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, at least 11 engineers, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/nearly-half-of-xais-founding-team-has-now-left-the-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two co-founders</a>, have publicly announced their departure from xAI in the past week — though two of those exits appear to have occurred a few weeks ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three of the departing staff members have said they will be starting something new alongside other former xAI engineers, although no details are available about the new venture. Others have hinted at a desire for more autonomy and smaller teams to build frontier tech more rapidly, pointing to the anticipated surge in AI productivity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead, <a href=\"https://x.com/Yuhu_ai_/status/2021113745024614671\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a post</a> announcing his resignation: “It’s time for my next chapter. It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shayan Salehian, who worked on product infrastructure and model behavior post-training at xAI and previously worked at Twitter/X, <a href=\"https://x.com/shayan_/status/2020240890233807232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said last week</a> he was leaving to “start something new.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vahid Kazemi, who had a brief stint working on machine learning, <a href=\"https://x.com/vahidk/status/2021392140933402976?s=46&amp;t=Epl8sTZrKzZ5ctcw3cgciw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted Tuesday</a> that he left a few weeks ago, adding: “IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring … So, I’m starting something new.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roland Gavrilescu, a former xAI engineer, left in November to start Nuraline, a company building “forward-deployed AI agents,” but posted again on Tuesday that he left the firm to build “something new with others that left xAI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The departures come at a moment of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/among-the-worst-weve-seen-report-slams-xais-grok-over-child-safety-failures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">significant controversy</a> for xAI. The company is facing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">regulatory scrutiny</a> after Grok created nonconsensual explicit deepfakes of women and children that were disseminated on X — <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/paris-prosecutors-raid-x-offices-as-part-of-investigation-over-child-abuse-images-deepfakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">French authorities last week raided X</a> offices as part of an investigation. The company is also moving toward a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">planned IPO</a> later this year, after being <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legally acquired by SpaceX</a> last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk is also facing personal controversy after files published by the Justice Department show extended conversations with convicted rapist and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The emails show Musk <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/expressed-interest-visiting-jeffrey-epstein-island-emails-show-doj-rcna256784\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discussing a visit to Epstein’s island</a> on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013. Epstein was first convicted of procuring a child for prostitution in 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI maintains a headcount of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-org-chart-employees-elon-musk-direct-reports-2025-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over 1,000 employees</a>, so the departures are unlikely to affect the company’s short-term capabilities. Still, the rapid pace of the recent departures had taken on a life of its own online, with users jokingly announcing on X that they too are “leaving xAI” despite never having worked there — a sign of how quickly the narrative of a “mass exodus” snowballed on Musk’s social network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, forced co-founder exits are rarely a sign of smooth scaling. While Musk frames the reorganization as calculated, the fact that several engineers followed the co-founders out the door — and that at least three are starting something new together — suggests the departures may also reflect deeper tensions. In frontier AI, where talent is scarce and reputation matters, xAI’s ability to attract and retain top researchers will be tested as it competes with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-timeline-of-departure-announcements\">Timeline of departure announcements</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The following employees have publicly announced their departures from xAI on X in recent days:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>February 6:  </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/ayushjaiswal/status/2019857451823296876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ayush Jaiswal</a>, engineer, wrote: “This was my last week at xAI.

A spokesperson for Odido told <a href=\"https://www.nu.nl/binnenland/6385809/gegevens-miljoenen-odido-klanten-gelekt-na-grote-cyberaanval.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">local Dutch media</a> that the breach affects more than 6.2 million customers, or about a third of the country’s population.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stolen data includes customer names, phone numbers, postal and email addresses, dates of birth, bank account numbers (IBAN), and details of customers’ government-issued IDs, such as passport or driver’s license numbers and dates of validity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said former customers who had service within the past two years may also be affected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Odido said the data did not include customer call records, location data, billing information, or image scans of government IDs. The data does not affect business customers, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The breach affects customers of both Odido and its <a href=\"https://www.ben.nl/veiligheid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">subsidiary Ben NL</a>. Both companies said that their phone, internet, and television operations were unaffected by the breach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the latest in a series of data thefts targeting phone and telecommunication giants in recent years, as governments and financially motivated hackers continue to seek highly confidential information that telcos have on their customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this week, the Singaporean government <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/singapore-china-backed-hackers-targeted-largest-phone-companies-salt-typhoon/\">confirmed</a> that a China-related hacking group had previously broken into four of the country’s top phone giants as part of a surveillance operation, but did not access customers’ personal information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All the while, hackers associated with the China-backed threat group known as Salt Typhoon have hacked hundreds of phone companies around the world, including in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/canada-says-telcos-were-breached-in-china-linked-espionage-hacks/\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/chinas-salt-typhoon-hackers-broke-into-norwegian-companies/\">Norway</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-expose-china-tech-companies-enabling-cyber-campaign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">United Kingdom</a>, and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/fbi-says-chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-at-least-200-us-companies/\">United States</a>, as part of an ongoing espionage campaign aimed at spying on senior government officials and diplomats.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

(Flock maintains that it <a href=\"https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/does-flock-share-data-with-ice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">does not explicitly</a> work with ICE.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ring wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-and-flock-cancel-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> that it made a joint decision with Flock to cancel the partnership because the integration would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This news comes less than a week after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OheUzrXsKrY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ring’s Super Bowl ad</a> aired, which showed how its AI-powered Search Party feature could use a network of neighborhood cameras to find lost dogs.

Using footage from Flock cameras, Flock’s government and police partners can make natural language searches of their video footage to find people who match specific descriptions.
