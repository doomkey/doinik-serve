The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo head <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/\">Ganesh Venkataramanan</a> and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also comes at a crucial time for Tesla. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/techcrunch-mobility-teslas-ride-hailing-gambit/\">CEO Elon Musk has pushed </a>to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. CEO Elon Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla’s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to “process truly vast amounts of video data.” He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company’s second-quarter earnings call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company’s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla’s AI team would “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/tesla-robotaxi-event-october-10-elon-musk/\">double down</a>” on Dojo in the lead-up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/tesla-robotaxi-event-follow-elon-musks-big-reveals-here/\">Tesla’s robotaxi reveal,</a> which happened in October. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla’s “giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/\">Venkataramanan</a> presented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia’s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/tesla-signs-16-5b-deal-with-samsung-to-make-ai-chips/\">$16.5 billion deal with Samsung</a> to make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Thinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it’s basically the same chip,” Musk said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/tesla-hands-29b-comp-package-to-elon-musk-amid-ai-talent-war/\">Tesla’s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay package</a> to keep him at Tesla and help push the company’s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla for more information. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Have a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

The results also highlighted the company’s acquisition strategy and how its purchase of a new optical payloads company will make it more competitive for lucrative government contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s space systems brought in $97.9 million of the $144.5 million in total revenues for the second quarter. Rocket Labs’ total revenue, its highest quarterly revenue in the company’s history, jumped 36% from a year ago. The company’s net loss widened to $66.4 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck highlighted the “busy quarter of M&amp;A activity” as the company gets close to closing its deal to buy <a href=\"https://www.geost.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Geost</a>, a company that builds optical payloads. Through that acquisition, which will close at $275 million in cash and equity, Rocket Lab is opening a new business unit called Optical Systems to scale electro-optical and infrared sensor manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those sensors are used in missile warning, tracking, and space domain awareness. The acquisition is also one part of a larger play from Rocket Lab — spelled out quite explicitly in the company’s earnings presentation — to bid for multibillion-dollar <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/golden-dome-may-not-be-the-golden-ticket-silicon-valley-is-hoping-for/\">DOD initiatives like Golden Dome.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab has already won some major defense contracts, including a $515 million, 18-satellite build contract to support the Space Development Agency’s constellation of missile-tracking satellites. The company has moved into production on those satellites, following confirmation that they meet the DOD’s mission requirements, Rocket Lab said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Down on Earth, Rocket Lab says it’s progressing well toward the first launch of its larger Neutron rocket. The rocket’s launch complex in Virginia is expected to be complete in the third quarter of this year, with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/rocket-labs-first-hurdle-to-flying-its-new-rocket-is-getting-it-to-the-pad/\">hardware en route</a> and the new rocket engine, called Archimedes, undergoing multiple tests per day.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is staying vague about the exact launch date, saying only in the presentation that it is pushing an “all-out effort to get Neutron to the launch pad before the end of 2025.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab ended the quarter with $564 million in cash and cash equivalents and estimates revenues will hit between $145 to $155 million next quarter.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February, AI coding startup Windsurf was in talks to raise a big new round at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/19/ai-coding-startup-codeium-in-talks-to-raise-at-an-almost-3b-valuation-sources-say/\">$2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins</a>, at double the valuation it hit six months earlier, sources told TechCrunch at the time. That deal didn’t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead, news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-is-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-windsurf-for-3b-with-news-expected-later-this-week/\">$3 billion</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are “very negative,” one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere’s Cursor and GitHub Copilot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a very expensive business to run if you’re not going to be in the model game,” said the person.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf’s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model — an expensive undertaking, the person said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Multiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Margins on all of the ‘code gen’ products are either neutral or negative. They’re absolutely abysmal,” said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/why-openai-wanted-to-buy-cursor-but-opted-for-the-fast-growing-windsurf/\">turned down acquisition offers</a>, including, reports say, from OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Anysphere <a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/tab-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced in January</a> that it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses.<strong> </strong>In July, the startup <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-revenue-hits-4-billion-annual-pace-competition-cursor-intensifies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hired two leaders from Anthropic’s Claude Code</a> team, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employees <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/anthropic-hires-back-two-coding-ai-leaders-cursor-developer-anysphere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">returned</a> to work at Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s what everyone’s banking on,” said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. “The inference cost today, that’s the most expensive it’s ever going to be.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/\">cost of some of the latest AI models has risen</a>, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">OpenAI introduced</a> a new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphere <a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/gpt-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">immediately offered</a> this model as a choice for Cursor users.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic’s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some of<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/\"> Cursor customers by surprise</a>, since they didn’t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in a <a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/june-2025-pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">$500 million in ARR in June</a>, the company’s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anysphere didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf’s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/more-details-emerge-on-how-windsurfs-vcs-and-founders-got-paid-from-the-google-deal/\">$2.4 billion payout</a> to key shareholders. The remaining business then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/cognition-maker-of-the-ai-coding-agent-devin-acquires-windsurf/\">sold itself to Cognition</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says location sharing is off by default on Instagram Map. Following <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/07/instagram-map-location-sharing-privacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">concerns</a> around safety, <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DNDwYMIsP7G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Instagram head Adam Mosseri</a> reassured users that the feature is opt-in, and noted that some people are “confused” about how the feature works. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, people are accessing the feature and then seeing the map populated with the location information of some users. This is because the feature automatically pulls in location tags from recently posted Stories or Reels that include a tagged location. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that this isn’t new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view.

That means it can now directly issue credit and debit cards and offer its spend management products to any business in all 30 EU countries with “no workarounds required,” as co-founder and CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote <a href=\"https://www.brex.com/journal/eu-license?ref_code=os_lin_EUblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the corporate spend management startup previously supported 60 currencies in 200 countries, it could only sell its products to companies with a U.S. presence. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the expansion, Brex is now authorized to sell spend management (complete with issuing cards) and other tools like embedded payments to EU companies and startups, a spokesperson tells TechCrunch. However, there’s a caveat: Banking and bill pay will not be initially available. The company hopes to roll those services out in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this is good news for Brex, it may also be good news for European startups. Brex’s claim to fame is offering startups expense management cards for their employees even if they wouldn’t yet qualify from traditional banks. Without a bank account offering, the youngest EU startups will still have to weigh their options.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next up, Franceschi says he wants to expand Brex in the U.K., though he offered no specifics on those plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Franceschi <a href=\"https://www.brex.com/journal/brex-in-founder-mode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in December</a> that Brex is on track to stop burning cash in 2025, “an important milestone to our future IPO.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February, sources told various news outlets that Brex was on track for $500 million in revenue this year as well. That’s quite the turnaround from a shaky moment in 2023 when Brex conducted layoffs and reportedly told employees that its cash burn was too high. There has been no hint yet as to when that IPO may take place, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brex’s competitive win in the international market comes as its U.S. fintech competitors are having an overall moment. Ramp has been raising money from VCs like mad, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/ramp-hits-22-5b-valuation-just-45-days-after-reaching-16b/?_thumbnail_id=2680663\">hitting a $22.5 billion valuation just 45 days</a> after a round with a $16 billion valuation. In March, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/26/fintech-mercury-lands-300m-in-sequoia-led-series-c-doubles-valuation-to-3-5b/\">Mercury raised a fresh $300 million</a> and doubled its valuation to $3.5 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brex has not publicly announced new equity VC funding since 2022, when it raised $300 million in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/brex-confirms-12-3b-valuation-hires-meta-exec-to-serve-as-its-chief-product-officer/\">Series D-2 round at a $12.3 billion</a> valuation.

It’s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of “company town.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Under a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend — at their cost — a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,” he continued. “They will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX’s construction schedule.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service, <a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/spacex-starbase-cameron-county-water-cutoff-20777749.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the San Antonio Express-News. </a>Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a “courtesy” service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase’s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff “poses safety and public health risks.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase “has neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,” Myers said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an “unconditional and perpetual agreement” to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase’s water and sewer system for residents’ agreement to leave the area for “any and all launch, testing and other operational activities.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The document also states that “SpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX’s water and wastewater treatment,” nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking “legal or monetary recourse” against the company.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-city-with-no-utilities\">A city — with no utilities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX’s sprawling South Texas launch site. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/04/residents-of-spacexs-starbase-launch-site-vote-to-incorporate-as-a-city/\">The city was incorporated in May</a>. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase’s role is limited by design: “The City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,” Myers told TechCrunch. “These services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don’t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX’s discretion, and on SpaceX’s terms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn’t create a public right to water. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch’s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

(Previously, the company gated these more advanced models behind a paywall.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is just one of the ways that I’m excited to live the mission, making sure that this stuff actually benefits people,” said Turley on the decision, referencing OpenAI’s long-standing <a href=\"https://openai.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mission</a> to distribute advanced AI to as many people as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expectations are high for GPT-5, one of OpenAI’s most anticipated product launches since ChatGPT put the company on the map in 2022. Since then, ChatGPT has grown into one of the world’s most popular consumer products, reaching more than 700 million users every week — nearly 10% of the globe’s population, according to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many see GPT-5 as a bellwether for AI progress broadly, and the model’s reception by Silicon Valley could have profound implications for Big Tech, Wall Street, and policymakers regulating technology. These stakeholders are watching to see if GPT-5 offers a significant jump in AI’s capabilities, much like its predecessor, GPT-4, which challenged expectations of what software can do.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gpt-5-offers-a-slight-edge-on-the-competition\">GPT-5 offers a slight edge on the competition</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI claims GPT-5 is state-of-the-art in several domains, slightly edging out leading AI models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Elon Musk’s xAI on key benchmarks. However, GPT-5 slightly underperforms frontier AI models in other areas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says GPT-5 offers frontier-level performance around coding; Altman said the model specifically excels at spinning up entire software applications on demand, in what’s become known as “vibe coding.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On SWE-bench Verified — a test of real-world coding tasks pulled from GitHub — GPT-5 scores 74.9% on its first attempt. That means GPT-5 just outperforms Anthropic’s latest Claude Opus 4.1 model, which scored <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">74.5%</a>, and Google DeepMind’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">59.6%</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Humanity’s Last Exam — a difficult test measuring AI model performance across math, humanities, and the natural sciences — a version of GPT-5 with extended reasoning (GPT-5 Pro) scored 42% when using tools. That’s slightly less than xAI was able to achieve with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/\">Grok 4 Heavy</a>, which scored 44.4% on the test.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035062\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png 1756w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=1200,794 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=1280,847 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=430,285 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=720,476 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=900,596 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=800,529 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=1536,1016 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=668,442 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=567,375 567w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=932,617 932w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=708,469 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On GPQA Diamond — a test of PhD-level science questions — GPT-5 pro scored 89.4% on its first try, outperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 80.9%, and Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 88.9%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says GPT-5 is better for answering health-related questions. On a test measuring accuracy in AI model responses around healthcare topics, HealthBench Hard Hallucinations, OpenAI says GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates just 1.6% of the time. This is far lower than the company’s previous GPT-4o and o3 models, which scored 12.9% and 15.8, respectively. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI chatbots are not medical professionals, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-chatbot-medical-advice-study-1235399973/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">millions of people</a> are using them for health advice. In response to this phenomenon, the company says GPT-5 is more proactive about flagging potential health concerns and helping users parse medical results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, OpenAI says GPT-5 is better than other AI models on more difficult-to-measure, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/03/inside-openais-quest-to-make-ai-do-anything-for-you/\">subjective domains,</a> such as creative design and writing. Turley said GPT-5 responds more naturally and exhibits “better taste” than other AI models on creative tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The vibes of this model are really good,” said Turley.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT-5 is also more accurate than OpenAI’s previous models, and the company says it suffers far less from hallucinations — the tendency for AI models to make up information — compared to its o-series models. Hallucinations seemed to be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/\">getting worse</a> in OpenAI’s latest AI reasoning models, such as o3, and OpenAI previously said it didn’t quite understand why it was happening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In responses to ChatGPT prompts, OpenAI found that GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates and responds with incorrect information 4.8% of the time. That’s a significant reduction from o3 and GPT-4o, which score hallucination rates of 22% and 20.6%, respectively, on the test.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a benchmark measuring an AI model’s agentic ability to complete simulated online tasks, Tau-bench, GPT-5 offers mixed performance. On part of the test measuring an AI’s ability to navigate an airline’s website, GPT-5 scores 63.5%, slightly underperforming o3, which scored 64.8%. On another part of the test measuring AI’s ability to navigate retail websites, GPT-5 scores 81.1%, underperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 82.4%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI also says that GPT-5 is safer than its previous models. While AI reasoning models occasionally exhibit a tendency to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/openais-o1-model-sure-tries-to-deceive-humans-a-lot/\">scheme against humans</a> or lie to promote their own goals, OpenAI found that GPT-5 was deceptive at a lower rate than other models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alex Beutel, OpenAI’s safety research lead, said reducing deception improves not only the safety of GPT-5, but also the user experience, creating a model that’s more “transparent and honest in ways users can trust.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beutel also notes GPT-5 is better at discerning between bad actors who are trying to misuse ChatGPT and users making harmless requests. This results in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-upgrades-for-consumers-and-developers\">Upgrades for consumers and developers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is getting a few user experience upgrades as part of the GPT-5 launch. Users can now select from four new personalities in ChatGPT’s setting: Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd. The company says these will adapt ChatGPT’s responses without requiring users to specifically ask the model to respond in a certain way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subscribers to ChatGPT’s $20-per-month Plus plan get higher usage limits for GPT-5 than free users. Meanwhile, $200-per-month Pro subscribers will have unlimited access to GPT-5, as well as a souped-up version called GPT-5 Pro that uses additional computational resources to produce better answers. Organizations on OpenAI’s Team, Edu, and Enterprise plans will gain access to GPT-5 as their default model next week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For developers, GPT-5 is coming to OpenAI’s API in three sizes — gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-5-nano — which will spend more or less time “reasoning” through tasks. Developers can also now control verbosity in the OpenAI API, deciding how long or short an AI model’s responses should be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The base model of GPT-5 will cost developers $1.25 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the entire “Lord of the Rings” series) and $10 per million output tokens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch of GPT-5 comes after a busy week for OpenAI. The company released an open-weight reasoning model, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/openai-launches-two-open-ai-reasoning-models/\">gpt-oss</a>, that developers and enterprises can download for free and run at a fraction of the cost. The open model nearly matched the abilities of OpenAI’s previous top models, o3 and o4-mini, but GPT-5 sets a new standard for frontier performance in some areas, such as coding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, GPT-5 seems to be roughly on par with other frontier AI models in several areas. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story for any AI model, and it remains to be seen how developers will use GPT-5 in the real world, and whether the model is truly a step above the competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We — Airbnb — can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the things we’ve noticed is it’s not enough to just have … the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that’s the key,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can’t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb’s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, AI will come to Airbnb’s search next year, the CEO said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it’s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because of this, Chesky doesn’t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as “potentially interesting lead generation” for the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that’s something that we’re certainly open to,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb beat analysts’ expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stock <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/airbnb-dips-slower-growth-outlook-renews-fears-travel-demand-slowdown-2025-08-07/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped</a> on its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Duolingo stock rose <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/duolingo-earnings-stock-price-e8ea55ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">almost 30%</a> on the news.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In April, CEO Luis von Ahn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7322560534824865792/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared</a> that Duolingo would become an “AI-first” company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,” von Ahn wrote at the time. “We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company’s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the company <a href=\"https://investors.duolingo.com/static-files/0b55110c-2eb9-466d-8549-5459e0851290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">anticipates</a> making over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company’s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday’s quarterly earnings call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn’t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,” von Ahn said. “The most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo’s videos often remain criticisms of the company’s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, “Nope. Made by our great team!” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not … and from the company’s perspective, that’s what matters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Nonetheless, the social media platform maintains control over which sources of information the AI search engine draws from.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truth Social is using the Perplexity Sonar API, which promises to query the web to retrieve current and verified information — even if that information is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/perplexity-accused-of-scraping-websites-that-explicitly-blocked-ai-scraping/\">scraped from websites that block Perplexity’s crawlers</a> — and supports structured output so users can define the format in which they’d like to see the search engine’s responses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jesse Dwyer, a Perplexity spokesperson, told TechCrunch that the Sonar API will be accurate to whatever sources Truth Social limits it to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have no visibility or control over that,” Dwyer said. “Similar to you using the API inside of your own company or if you were an academic researcher and wanted to use it to search your own data.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Trump Media to learn more about whether Truth Search AI will have access to the entire web, whether it will prioritize certain sources over others, and whether the AI will be directed to respond favorably about the president and current administration and unfavorably toward Democrats. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To assess which sources the searchbot would cite, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/08/06/trump-truth-social-perplexity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios</a> asked it a bunch of questions — like “What happened on January 6, 2021?” and “Why was Donald Trump impeached?” In all the responses, <a href=\"http://foxnews.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FoxNews.com</a> was either the most common or the only listed source of information. Others included <a href=\"http://foxbusiness.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FoxBusiness.com</a>, The Washington Times, or Epoch Times, per Axios.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In contrast, Perplexity’s public search engine returns a wider variety of sources, including Wikipedia, Reddit, YouTube, NPR, and Politico.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truth Social plans to refine and expand the search function “based on user feedback as we implement a wide range of additional enhancements to the platform,” said Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and a former California congressman, in the statement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity’s chief business officer, also noted in the statement that Perplexity’s AI delivers answers with “transparent citations that allow anyone to dig deeper.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In late July, alongside his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/\">AI Action Plan</a>, Trump <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-anti-woke-ai-order-could-reshape-how-us-tech-companies-train-their-models/\">published an executive order targeting “biased AI,”</a> or models that aren’t “ideologically neutral.” The order specifically referred to information about race or sex, unconscious bias, systemic racism, and other ideas thrown into the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) bucket as “pervasive and destructive” ideology that can “distort the quality and accuracy of the output.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truth Search AI comes in the same week that top AI firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/us-adds-openai-google-and-anthropic-to-list-of-approved-ai-vendors-for-federal-agencies/\">added to a list of approved vendors</a> that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies.

The changes to the sections, which pertained to congressional powers, the rights of individual states, and the rights to due process, sparked alarm at a time when the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qgz18glljo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">threatened to suspend habeas corpus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the changes were reported, the Library of Congress tweeted that the sections were missing due to a “coding error.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch reached out to the Library of Congress and received more insight into the issue: </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The online Constitution Annotated is an educational tool which includes discussions of the Supreme Court’s latest opinions linked to the text of the Constitution. When updating the site to reflect our constitutional scholars’ analysis of the impact of the latest cases on Article I, Sections 8-10, the team inadvertently removed an XML tag,” Bill Ryan, the director of communications for the Library of Congress, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This prevented publication of everything in Article I after the middle of Section 8. The problem has been corrected, and our updated constitutional analysis is now available. We are taking steps to prevent a recurrence in the future,” said Ryan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">XML is a commonly used markup language used by the Library of Congress to format its website. A missing closing tag could plausibly result in missing text from the website, as anything outside of the tag would be ignored. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The full text of the Constitution has now been reinstated on the Library of Congress <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">website</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The first two MuSat XL spacecraft will deliver a 12-hour global revisit time and detect Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals at 30 times lower power than current capabilities, Hubble says. If those numbers pan out, it could materially extend battery life for tracking tags and sensors here on Earth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those two satellites will form the backbone of Hubble’s BLE Finding Network for enterprises in sectors ranging from logistics, infrastructure, and defense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hubble <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/hubble-network-connects-a-bluetooth-chip-to-a-satellite-for-the-first-time/\">made history in 2024</a> when it became the first company to establish a Bluetooth connection directly to a satellite. The startup’s proposition is compelling: Instead of needing to buy specialized hardware, customers will only need to integrate their devices’ chipsets with a piece of firmware to enable connection to the Hubble network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits of the space-based network are massive, Hubble argues: It can provide visibility across the globe, including in remote areas, and offers a developer-friendly way to let companies track assets without building any additional infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company currently has seven spacecraft on orbit with a target of having 60 satellites in operation by 2028. The long-term goal is to upgrade the entire constellation to the larger platform buses because of their power and performance upgrades, Haro said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an aggressive schedule, but Haro added that one reason Hubble chose to partner with Muon is the latter’s ability to rapidly scale manufacturing to hit this goal, despite being a young company. (A recent <a href=\"https://www.muonspace.com/press/muon-space-completes-146-million-series-b-to-scale-satellite-constellations-for-defense-and-commercial-missions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$146 million funding round</a> should help.) Gregory Smirin, president of Muon Space, told TechCrunch that the company’s San Jose production facility is being built out to support production of over 500 spacecraft per year by 2027. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hubble is the first customer for the 500 kilogram-class MuSat XL satellite platform, which Muon says can provide multi-kilowatt power to payloads, optical crosslinks, high-volume downlink, and “near real-time” communications for time-sensitive missions. The partnership also signals a bigger push by the company to compete for more lucrative contracts with the Department of Defense. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The XL platform “is a perfect size and capability for SDA Tranche missions,” Smirin said, referring to the Space Development Agency’s initiative to build out a missile defense constellation in low Earth orbit. “XL reflects both the evolution of our technical stack and our growing role in delivering the kind of multi-mission spacecraft that programs like SDA increasingly rely on.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Muon’s business model can be thought of as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/muon-space-closes-56m-to-scale-all-in-one-satellite-platform/\">space-as-a-service</a>: The company designs, builds, and operates satellites using a vertically integrated stack of hardware and software. The stack, called Halo, is meant to open up space access for companies with promising payloads but no interest in building the underlying satellite architecture. In practice, that means Hubble can focus on developing the BLE network while Muon handles the satellite platforms and mission operations. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But Google on Wednesday denied that’s the case, at least in aggregate. Instead, the search giant says that total organic click volume from its search engine to websites has been “relatively stable” year-over-year and that average click quality has slightly increased.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This data is in contrast to third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic — often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the roll out of AI features in Search,” writes Google VP and Head of Search, Liz Reid, in <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-search-driving-more-queries-higher-quality-clicks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a new blog post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Google hasn’t shared any specific data to back up its conclusions, even if we assume Google’s claims to be true, this doesn’t necessarily mean that AI isn’t having an impact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even Google has to admit this, as Reid acknowledges that “user trends are shifting traffic to different sites, resulting in decreased traffic to some sites and increased traffic to others.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That word “some” is doing heavy lifting here, as Google doesn’t share data about how many sites are gaining or losing. And while chatbots like ChatGPT have certainly seen traffic increase in recent months, that doesn’t mean online publishers aren’t suffering.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3009660\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg 2224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1200,599 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1280,639 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=720,359 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=900,449 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=800,399 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1536,767 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=2048,1022 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=668,333 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1236,617 1236w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=708,353 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has been revamping its search engine for years to answer more questions directly on the search results page, and now does so with AI through its “AI Overviews” that appear at the top of search results. Google also allows users to interact with an AI chatbot for some queries. Yet Google denies that this is significantly reshaping the search landscape. Rather, it points to users shifting their attention to other sites to start their queries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reid explains, “People are increasingly seeking out and clicking on sites with forums, videos, podcasts, and posts where they can hear authentic voices and first-hand perspectives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reading between the lines, it seems like Google.com isn’t necessarily people’s first stop on the web these days. (Google denies this, telling us that Reid’s commentary is only reflective of trends it’s seeing in traffic to sites from Google.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, we’ve seen this trend for some time. Back in 2022, a Google exec even said that social sites like TikTok and Instagram <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps/\">were eating into Google’s core products</a>, like Search and Maps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In our studies, something like almost 40% of young people, when they’re looking for a place for lunch, they don’t go to Google Maps or Search,” said Google SVP Prabhakar Raghavan, who ran the company’s Knowledge and Information organization at the time (he is now its chief technologist). “They go to TikTok or Instagram,” he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has also long been worried that Amazon.com had become people’s first stop for online shopping searches, and Reddit.com had become the first stop for researching topics of interest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over many years, the company has tried to come up with compelling features for both consumers and retailers that would attract more users to Google Shopping. These efforts have included <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/google-introduces-shopping-actions-to-help-retailers-in-their-battle-with-amazon/\">universal shopping carts</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/google-lens-new-feature-makes-it-easier-to-shop-products-in-store/\">local inventory checks</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/01/google-search-new-shopping-features-get-better-deal/\">deal finders</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/google-adds-news-ways-to-shop-like-turning-a-websites-photos-into-shoppable-products/\">shopping from product images on websites</a>, and more. It even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/\">made its Shopping listings free</a> for merchants in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, as users <a href=\"https://dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">complained that Google Search quality was declining</a>, the search giant was seeing so much demand for Reddit that it finally <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/google-search-now-queries-reddit-and-quora-in-response-to-open-ended-questions/#!\">added a “Reddit” filter</a> to allow users to narrow down results on relevant search queries. (Now that filter simply reads “forums.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So perhaps there’s some truth in Google’s denials — it’s not AI that’s entirely responsible for killing search. Search was already dying. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"A person holding an iPhone and using Google AI Mode\" class=\"wp-image-3017226\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg 5196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Smith Collection/Gado / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s new blog post also attempts to move the goalposts a bit about what it means for websites receiving Google’s clicks. Now, instead of counting clicks, it wants publishers to think about click quality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says average click quality has increased, and Google is sending “slightly more quality clicks” to websites than a year ago. (Google explains that a quality click is one where users don’t quickly click back — they stay and read.) How much of an increase, though, Google doesn’t say. The company only points out that when people click through on an AI response to the source, they’re more likely to dive deeper, so those clicks are more valuable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, Google paints AI as an opportunity for web publishers to gain increased exposure, saying that “with AI Overviews, people are seeing more links on the page than before,” Reid writes. “More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/ai-referrals-to-top-websites-were-up-357-year-over-year-in-june-reaching-1-13b/\">while a growing referral source</a>, isn’t <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/chatgpt-referrals-to-news-sites-are-growing-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines/\">yet making up the difference</a> in terms of clicks, reports have shown. One recent study from Similarweb indicates that the number of news searches on the web resulting in zero clicks to news websites has grown from 56% (when Google launched AI Overviews in May 2024) to 69% as of May 2025. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3024257\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg 1912w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=300,254 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=768,650 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=680,575 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=1200,1015 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=1280,1083 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=430,364 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=720,609 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=900,762 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=800,677 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=1536,1300 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=668,565 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=443,375 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=729,617 729w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=627,531 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Similarweb</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google appears to know this is a trend, too, as it recently launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/as-ai-kills-search-traffic-google-launches-offerwall-to-boost-publisher-revenue/\">a product for publishers</a> that helps them monetize their dwindling traffic in other ways that don’t rely only on advertising, like micropayments or newsletter sign-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that Google is pushing this <em>“</em>AI is not the end of search traffic!” PR now only makes the situation seem more dire.
