Discovery</a>, setting the stage for Paramount Skydance to win ownership of the Hollywood studio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said they were being financially disciplined. Now <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-27/how-david-ellison-outlasted-netflix-in-the-warner-bros-bidding-war\">reporting in Bloomberg</a> offers more details about why Netflix executives backed down from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/warner-bros-netflix-paramount-acquisition-timeline-wbd/\">a bidding war that it seemed to win back in December</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one thing, the streaming giant’s shareholders appeared deeply skeptical that the acquisition was a good deal — Netflix’s share price declined 30% since announcing the deal, while the subsequent news that it was backing down <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/28/business/media/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-analysts.html\">sent Netflix stock up nearly 14%</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For another, Netflix’s commitment to the deal reportedly wavered after Paramount came in with an increased offer and seemed willing to go several more rounds in a bidding war.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the time Sarandos met with Trump administration officials on Thursday, he may already have decided to concede. In fact, since President Donald Trump had previously warned him not to overpay, Sarandos reportedly told him, “I took your advice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, employees at Warner Bros. now worry about <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/28/business/warner-bros-paramount-reaction.html\">major studio layoffs</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/17722120321108aa883dc7fda/raw\">conservative political pressure on CNN</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood and the media business as we know it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After years of Warner Bros. Discovery struggling under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/tv-burdened-wbd-will-struggle-cut-cord-2025-06-05/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declining cable viewership</a> and fierce competition from streaming platforms, the company has been considering major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant and in December, Netflix <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-in-a-disruptive-deal-valued-at-82-7b/\">announced it would acquire</a> WBD’s studios and streaming for $82.7 billion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in a surprise eleventh-hour move this month, it now looks like the David Ellison-run <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-wbd-bid-studios-hbo-cnn-ellison/\">Paramount will actually be the winner</a> of this bidding war, offering $111 billion to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets, including its studios, HBO, streaming platforms, games, and TV networks such as CNN and HGTV. Paramount was itself recently acquired by Ellison with significant support from his father, the Oracle chairman, world’s sixth-richest person, and major Trump donor Larry Ellison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paramount’s offer still awaits formal approval from WBD’s board of directors, and any potential agreement may also face pressure from regulators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s break down exactly what is happening, what’s at stake, and what could come next. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-has-happened-so-far\">What has happened so far?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) <a href=\"https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revealed it was exploring a potential sale</a> after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco, CA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The bidding process quickly became competitive, and Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/david-ellisons-paramount-seen-front-runner-warner-bros-discovery-deal-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Paramount</a> initially viewed as the frontrunner. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, WBD’s board eventually determined that an offer from the streaming giant Netflix was the most attractive. Netflix offered $82.7 billion for just Warner’s film, television, and streaming assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thus began the bidding war. Paramount believed its bid, of approximately $108 billion for all of Warner’s assets, was superior to Netflix’s offer that focused on just the studios and streaming. To sweeten its deal, Netflix <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/netflix-revises-offer-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-stave-off-paramount/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">amended its agreement</a> in January to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per share of Warner Bros. Discovery, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD</a>. Still, the Warner board repeatedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rejected</a> its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal, including concern over the suite of investors bankrolling Paramount’s bid, which includes Saudi, Qatari, and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/paramount-files-lawsuit-against-warner-bros-amidst-controversial-netflix-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed a lawsuit</a> seeking more information about the Netflix deal. A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-enhances-its-superior-30-per-share-all-cash-offer-for-warner-bros-discovery-and-provides-update-on-regulatory-progress-302683694.html?tc=eml_cleartime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcing </a>it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Warner backs out of its deal with Netflix.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, in a final attempt to secure a deal, Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share in February. This prompted the WBD board to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-board-directors-determines-revised-proposal-paramount-skydance\">prolong discussions</a> with Paramount regarding a potential agreement, considering it as a superior offer. Netflix declined to increase its bid and withdrew from the negotiations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx\">said in a statement</a> on Feb. 26. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the billions Paramount already holds in debt, the company is also set to assume the approximately $33 billion in debt Warner Bros. Discovery holds <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-form-next-generation\">under the agreement</a>. The deal will be <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-27/paramount-s-57-5-billion-of-warner-debt-to-mix-junk-high-grade\">backed</a> by a $54 billion debt commitment from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, and Apollo Global Management, as well as $45.7 billion in equity from Larry Ellison.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-regulatory-hurdles-and-other-concerns\">Regulatory hurdles and other concerns </h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"render of the US Capitol dome on red background\" class=\"wp-image-2024308\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the assumption of substantial debt posing a significant financial burden, Paramount faces several other hurdles in its deal with WBD that could impact the success of the transaction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one, Ellison has warned about significant job reductions that are expected in the near future. There have already been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">widespread concerns among critics</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">about potential job losses</a> and lower wages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellison is also a controversial figure in the industry, and his ownership of CBS News has been seen as sympathetic and supportive of the administration of Donald Trump, of whom his father, Larry Ellison, is a major donor. Under Ellison’s ownership of Paramount, reporting critical of the administration has been shelved or received increased scrutiny from Ellison or his appointed head of CBS News, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has led to some concern among employees at Warner-owned CNN. Trump has personally sought concessions from news divisions critical of him, including a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-harris-minutes-paramount-6415042fe910ae60b432dd8c73ef61b2\">$16 million settlement from CBS</a>, before his FCC <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/business/media/fcc-skydance-merger-paramount.html\">would approve</a> the Ellison takeover of Paramount. Before Netflix bowed out of the deal, Trump <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/22/trump-says-netflix-will-face-consequences-if-it-doesnt-fire-board-member-susan-rice/\">pressured the company</a> to fire the former Biden White House official Susan Rice from its board. He has publicly stated his intentions to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/28/trump-paramount-skydance-warner-bros-cnn-netflix\">bring CNN to heel</a> under new owners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regulatory scrutiny is another hurdle. Such a large-scale merger has attracted attention from lawmakers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, California Attorney General Rob Bonta <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://variety.com/2026/biz/news/rob-bonta-california-ag-warn-paramount-warner-bros-1236674377/\">said in a statement</a> on February 26 that “these two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A day before Netflix backed out, it was revealed that a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dojmt.gov/attorney-general-knudsen-asks-usdoj-to-review-proposed-netflix-warner-brothers-merger/\">coalition of 11 state attorneys general</a> urged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to review the merger under concerns it will stifle competition and increase subscription prices. This comes months after U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal voiced <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sen-elizabeth-warren-letter-doj-wbd-sale-paramount-1236430180/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division</a>, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Ellison’s father, the Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, is a significant Trump donor and has close ties to the Trump administration. His deal to acquire Paramount last year cleared quickly after acquiescing to c</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-when-is-the-deal-expected-to-close\">When is the deal expected to close?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is not yet final.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, a deal with Netflix was expected to lead to a stockholder vote around April, with the deal anticipated to close within 12 to 18 months following that vote. However, the transition to the Paramount deal will likely create a new timeline for approval. Plus, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stay tuned…</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-boom-far-over-after-tepid-sales-forecast-2025-08-28/\">recent earnings call</a>, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size\" id=\"h-microsoft-s-2019-investment-in-openai\">Microsoft’s 2019 investment in OpenAI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In 2019</a>, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in the form of Azure cloud credit</a> rather than cash. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. Last year, OpenAI announced it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/microsoft-is-no-longer-openais-exclusive-cloud-provider/\">no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively</a>, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. Microsoft has also begun exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-amazon-trainium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">making kernel-level modifications</a> on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/how-ai-startups-are-fueling-googles-booming-cloud-business/\">smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf</a> as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-171740706.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in September</a>, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size\" id=\"h-the-rise-of-oracle\">The rise of Oracle</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a spot alongside Google</a> as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco, CA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A few months later, it happened again. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/openai-and-oracle-reportedly-ink-historic-cloud-computing-deal/\">On September 10</a>, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/why-the-oracle-openai-deal-caught-wall-street-by-surprise/\">climbed even higher</a>, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nvidia-s-investment-spree\">Nvidia’s investment spree</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, Nvidia bought <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/nvidia-buys-5-billion-stake-in-intel-planning-ai-chip-collaboration/\">a 4% stake in rival Intel </a>for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-as-huang-touts-biggest-ai-infrastructure-project-in-history-171740509.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a $100 billion investment in OpenAI</a>, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement</a> with AMD.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that seems circular, it’s because it is. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size\" id=\"h-building-tomorrow-s-hyperscale-data-centers\">Building tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For companies like Meta that already have <a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/research/metas-hyperscale-infrastructure-overview-and-insights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">significant legacy infrastructure</a>, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">through the end of 2028</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the first half of 2025, the company spent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/meta-to-spend-up-to-72b-on-ai-infrastructure-in-2025-as-compute-arms-race-escalates/\">$30 billion more</a> than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent <a href=\"https://aimagazine.com/news/inside-metas-cloud-deal-with-google-for-ai-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$10 billion deal with Google Cloud</a>, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, <a href=\"https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/55248311/meta-sees-10b-ai-data-center-in-louisiana-using-combo-of-clean-energy-nuclear-power\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dubbed Hyperion</a>, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power</a>. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/06/elon-musk-xai-memphis-gas-turbines-air-pollution-permits-00317582?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR5SDS-dmGr0PSpTHkF5PV2cXs3-rKqNuPaMbeyJmaGGE56-qWvJrA29i9S4pg_aem_leaKorFEsIQuzImIDd960A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">experts say violate the Clean Air Act</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size\" id=\"h-the-stargate-moonshot\">The Stargate moonshot</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just two days after his second inauguration last January, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” OpenAI’s Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/softbank-concedes-stargate-project-with-openai-needs-more-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In August</a>, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of <a href=\"https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/stargate-abilene/abilenes-data-center-advances-swiftly-with-5000-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eight data centers in Abilene, Texas</a>, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-capex-crunch\">The capex crunch</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Capital expenditures” are usually a pretty dry metric, referring to a company’s spending on physical assets. But as tech companies lined up to report their capex plans for 2026, the rush of data center spending <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\">made the figures a lot more interesting</a> — and a lot bigger.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon was the capex leader, projecting $200 billion in 2026 spending (up from $131 billion in 2025), while Google was a close second with an estimate between $175 billion and $185 billion (up from $91 billion in 2025). Meta estimated $115 billion to $135 billion (up from $71 billion the previous year), although that figure is a little deceptive because a lot of the data center projects have been <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/jobs-report-unemployment-stock-market-02-11-2026/card/meta-auditor-ey-raised-red-flag-on-data-center-accounting-TrOVlxGZGnL37d8Dv01h?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfLXi35LrT-GxBcA2HfmYDh8FG583K_0E6c2WgM_SIDUcsKWHr4kNRX1d6jgvY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69a20a98&amp;gaa_sig=5xmE3fdoZvA2Mg1RclWhfPyZ8-sO-CcIMq4H5IxjABAspxoyn9VKlAjU2ngMwO5DQdwlGnGuVoCBE0SIXkX1pg%3D%3D\">kept off their books entirely</a>. All told, hyperscalers are planning to spend <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/google-microsoft-meta-amazon-ai-cash.html\">nearly $700 billion on data center projects in 2026 alone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was enough money to spook some investors. The companies were mostly undeterred, however, explaining that AI infrastructure was vital to their companies’ future. It’s set up a strange dynamic. As you might expect, tech executives are more bullish on AI than their Wall Street counterparts — and the more tech companies spend, the more nervous their bankers get. Add in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/31/ai-data-centers-debt-sam-altman-elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg.html\">huge amounts of debt</a> many companies are taking on to fund those buildouts, and you start to hear CFOs across the valley grinding their teeth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That hasn’t put a damper on AI spending yet, but it will soon — unless of course, hyperscalers show they can make those investments pay off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was first published on September 22.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Pentagon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/anthropic-and-the-pentagon-are-reportedly-arguing-over-claude-usage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pushed AI companies,

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the company “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an <em>ad hoc</em> manner,” but he argued that “in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 60 OpenAI employees and 300 Google employees <a

the “Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic” in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-moves-to-designate-anthropic-as-a-supply-chain-risk/\">a social media post</a> that also directed federal

said OpenAI “will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted,” and it will deploy engineers with the Pentagon “to help with our models and to

Now, rapid advances in multimodal AI are accelerating so-called embodied AI — autonomous machines operating in the real world — a push officials say could help offset labor shortages and drive productivity gains. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this early stage of humanoid robot development, Chinese companies are outpacing their U.S. rivals in both speed and volume, Selina Xu, a China and AI policy lead at the office of Eric Schmidt said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“China has a more robust hardware supply chain — much of it built up through the EV sector, from sensors to batteries — and the world’s strongest manufacturing base, allowing companies to iterate far faster than Western competitors,” Xu told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, not only are Chinese robots cheaper but companies can also release new models more quickly, Xu noted, adding that leading Chinese player Unitree shipped roughly 36 times more units last year than U.S. rivals Figure and Tesla.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global humanoid robot shipments totaled just 13,317 units last year, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2026/01/09/top-10-humanoid-robot-companies-by-shipments-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to a Forbes</a> report released last month. That is a tiny base for an industry expected to nearly double annually and reach 2.6 million units by 2035. (Still, the figures should be viewed with caution.

That practical pull is strengthened in China because policy and industrial strategy encourage automation upgrades, and the manufacturing ecosystem makes iteration extremely fast,” Zhao said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While increased funding toward humanoid startups “has definitely accelerated” the pace of progress, “the most durable adoption comes when you can show reliable and repeatable value in production or service operations, not just a one-off showcase,” Zhao added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, investing helps and Chinese robotics makers are securing it. Last year Unitree was valued at around $3 billion after closing its Series C, with ambitions to reach as much as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-robotics-firm-unitree-eyeing-7-billion-ipo-valuation-sources-say-2025-09-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$7 billion in a future IPO</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/galbot-secures-over-300-million-190800748.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Galbot</a> has raised more than $300 million in fresh funding, reportedly pushing its valuation to $3 billion, one of the largest financings in China’s humanoid robotics sector to date. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. companies are moving beyond flashy demos as well to focus on real-world deployments. Plus, they are pursuing their own aggressive goals. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2025/12/16/humanoid-robots-for-war-and-work-startup-plans-to-build-50000-by-end-of-2027/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.S. startup Foundation</a>, for instance, plans to build 50,000 humanoid robots by the end of 2027. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But China is already targeting a mix of affordable mass-market models and high-end applications, rapidly expanding humanoids across industrial, consumer, and rehabilitation sectors, according to a December <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20251209-12825.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TrendForce report</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bottlenecks-nbsp-to-china-s-dominance\">Bottlenecks to China’s dominance</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it comes to AI systems and integrated software, it’s still unclear where Chinese humanoid firms truly stand. The industry is largely betting on vision-language-action models and “world models,” but both technologies remain in early stages. Nvidia currently leads the space with its end-to-end humanoid software stack, according to Xu, so naturally most humanoid startups in China are powered by Nvidia’s Orin chips. However, domestic chipmakers are developing homegrown alternatives, she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet humanoid robotics makers are still working on fundamental problems. The challenge is enabling robot foundation models to predict the “next physical state” the robot will face in unpredictable environments, like how large language models predict the next word. But unlike LLMs, humanoid robotics companies can’t simply scrape the internet for training data, Xu said. So most are relying on simulation environments, which generates synthetic data, though real-world data collection remains essential. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Because of the data scarcity problem, humanoids are still far away from autonomy. The hardware is currently ahead of the software — the robot body can handle a lot more dexterity today than years ago (though it has reliability issues, as we saw with the robots that broke down at humanoid marathons), but the brain is still nascent,” the analyst said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Safety is a major hurdle for humanoid robots, too. One high-profile accident could trigger public backlash, and China is likely weighing how to roll out the technology quickly without moving too fast. As the industry matures, more regulations are expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the lack of data, Zhao believes that demand for humanoids will grow first in fairly contained workplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Early momentum is likely to be in industrial manufacturing, warehouse logistics, and retail, where tasks are repetitive, hours are long, and processes are clear — creating real demand and ideal conditions for humanoid robots to deliver value at scale,” he said. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-other-apac-players-nbsp\">Other APAC players </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humanoid robot development is not a two-country race. Japan’s robotics ecosystem — from startups to semiconductor heavyweights — is <a href=\"https://japan-forward.com/japan-to-mass-produce-humanoid-robots-by-2027/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">targeting humanoid mass production by 2027</a>. Long a pioneer through projects like Honda’s Asimo, Murata Manufacturing’s Murata Boy, and SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper, Japan leans on precision and advanced control. One area unique to this nation: Humanoid robots are increasingly used in eldercare.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coral Capital CEO James Riney, who invests in tech companies in Japan, believes Tokyo will continue to thrive in the humanoid robotics industry. “There are three factors likely to drive the adoption of robotics in Japan. One is the labor shortage and the desire to depend less on mass immigration. The second is the widespread cultural view of robots as our friends — more Doraemon vs. Terminator. The third is that Japan is already dominant in many parts of the robotics supply chain.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyundai Motor’s Boston Dynamics unit <a href=\"https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/0000001105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced a new Atlas humanoid for factory use by 2028</a>, with plans to produce up to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-05/hyundai-unveils-new-humanoid-robot-to-work-in-its-car-factories?srnd=undefined\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">30,000 units annually in the U.S.</a> as part of its AI-driven robotics push.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, for China, government policy, industrial strategy, labor shortages, and private capital are all converging to turbocharge the country’s humanoid robotics push. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “China’s leadership is best understood as a speed-to-scale advantage,” Zhao said. “The ecosystem here compresses the entire cycle — R&amp;D, supply chain, manufacturing, integration, and customer deployment — into a very tight loop. That means humanoid companies can move from prototype to real-world deployment faster, learn from real operations, and iterate at a pace that’s difficult to match elsewhere.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Access to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company <a href=\"https://x.com/supabase/status/2026374754438087119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acknowledging the issue</a> in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco, CA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3098083\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=150,24 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=300,47 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=768,121 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=680,107 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=1200,189 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=1280,201 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=430,68 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=720,113 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=900,142 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=800,126 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=1536,242 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=668,105 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=1440,227 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=708,111 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-supabase-blocking.jpg?resize=50,8 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A screenshot showing Supabase’s access blocked on ACT Fibernet</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot / Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Supabase’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://supabase.com/\">main website </a>remained accessible in India — but its underlying developer infrastructure did not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is Supabase’s fourth-largest source of traffic, accounting for about 9% of global visits, according to data from Similarweb, highlighting the potential fallout for the country’s developer ecosystem.

He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The comment came up in a line of questioning about a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/1100-notable-signatories-just-signed-an-open-letter-asking-all-ai-labs-to-immediately-pause-for-at-least-6-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">public letter</a> Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a <a href=\"https://socialmediavictims.org/press-releases/smvlc-tech-justice-law-project-lawsuits-accuse-chatgpt-of-emotional-manipulation-supercharging-ai-delusions-and-acting-as-a-suicide-coach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">series of lawsuits</a> alleging that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics</a> have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/elon-musk-openai-sam-altman-court/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lawsuit</a> against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Musk claims violated</a> its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">flooded with nonconsensual nude images</a> generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">were said to be of minors</a>. This led the California Attorney General’s office to <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open an investigation</a> into the matter. The EU is also <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/musks-grok-chatbot-faces-eu-privacy-investigation-over-sexualized-deepfake-images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">running its own investigation</a>, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?w=500\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097909\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>imgflip</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/elon-musk-used-to-say-he-put-100m-in-openai-but-now-its-50m-here-are-the-receipts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">supposed $100 million donation</a> to OpenAI; the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69013420/170/musk-v-altman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">second amended complaint</a> in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The past two weeks have been defined by a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">clash</a> between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/anthropic-ceo-stands-firm-as-pentagon-deadline-looms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amodei publicly signaled</a> that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-anthropic-worried-about\">What is Anthropic worried about?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a <a href=\"https://www.esd.whs.mil/portals/54/documents/dd/issuances/dodd/300009p.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2023 DOD directive</a>, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco, CA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-the-pentagon-want\">What does the Pentagon want?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Thursday X post</a> that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In <a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/4377190/remarks-by-secretary-of-war-pete-hegseth-at-spacex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January</a>, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-so-what-now\">So what now?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2027294561467613256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elon Musk’s rhetoric </a>on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent <a href=\"https://x.com/Hadas_Gold/status/2027389332445671498?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal is reportedly valued at around $150 million per season, a significant jump from the roughly <a href=\"https://www.planetf1.com/news/f1-2025-revenue-record-3-billion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$85 million</a> ESPN reportedly paid. All races are available to Apple TV subscribers at no extra charge.

It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Hkq2C4Wr9rhr0OV9hOfNI4oA4y?domain=perplexity.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">example workflows</a> on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial, or legal data; creating analysis; and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company canceled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base — in the tens of millions of users — pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco, CA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done in Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097675\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg 3799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=768,398 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1200,621 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1280,663 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=430,223 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=720,373 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=900,466 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=800,414 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1536,795 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=2048,1060 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=668,346 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1192,617 1192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=708,367 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Perplexity</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on user fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And there is more on the horizon: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the execs at the briefing dismiss such complaints: “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” one said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Fans have also honed in on a <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-winds-waves-cloud-legendary-gyarados-theories-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suspicious-looking cloud</a> in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly 10 years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-bluesky-social wp-block-embed-bluesky-social\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Main series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region … but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/21/pokemon-scarlet-violet-preview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and being rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen games today for the Switch … but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/retro-game-emulator-delta-app-store-ios/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">extremely easy and legally dubious</a> way to get those games on your phone for free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/anthropic-pentagon-ai-policy-war-spying.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> that he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokesperson <a href=\"https://x.com/Hadas_Gold/status/2027389332445671498?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirmed</a> that the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google DeepMind has not formally addressed the conflict, but Chief Scientist Jeff Dean, presumably speaking as an individual, did express opposition to mass surveillance by the government.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco, CA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mass surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment and has a chilling effect on freedom of expression,” Dean <a href=\"https://x.com/JeffDean/status/2026566490619879574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> on X. “Surveillance systems are prone to misuse for political or discriminatory purposes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/23/ai-defense-department-deal-musk-xai-grok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios</a> report, the military currently can use X’s Grok, Google’s Gemini, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT for unclassified tasks, and has been negotiating with Google and OpenAI to bring its technology over for use in classified work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Anthropic has an existing partnership with the Pentagon, the AI company has remained firm in maintaining the boundary that its AI be used for neither mass domestic surveillance, nor fully autonomous weaponry.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/\">told Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei</a> that if his company doesn’t concede, the Pentagon will either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to comply with military demands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a statement on Thursday</a>, Amodei maintained his company’s position. “These latter two threats are inherently contradictory: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security,” the statement reads. “Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now the agency has replaced its top acting leader, a CISA spokesperson tells TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move to replace Madhu Gottumukkala as the acting director of CISA, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees cybersecurity and technical protection across the federal government, comes after a tumultuous year serving as the agency’s top boss.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gottumukkala struggled to lead the agency during his tenure as acting director and caused <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/trumps-acting-cybersecurity-chief-uploaded-sensitive-government-docs-to-chatgpt/\">security headaches</a>, including the uploading of sensitive government documents to ChatGPT, according to reports.

Wyden demanded the report’s release <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/fbi-says-chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-at-least-200-us-companies/\">in the wake of hundreds of hacks</a> targeting U.S. and international phone and internet providers by the China-backed hacking group known as Salt Typhoon.

Similar to the streaming giant’s Music and Podcast Charts, the Audiobook Charts will be updated weekly and highlight the top audiobooks overall and by genre. These rankings are based on listening behavior and engagement on the streaming service, the company says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new charts are accessible to both free and paying users within the audiobooks hub. You can find them by tapping the search button in the app and selecting the “Audiobooks” tile to enter the hub. Then, you need to scroll down to the “Dive deeper” section to find the charts. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move marks Spotify’s latest investment in the audiobooks space, following its official support of the format in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, Spotify has continued investing in audiobooks with additional features like the recently launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/spotify-ventures-into-physical-book-sales-adds-new-audiobook-features/\">“Page Match” tool</a>, which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps,” which are short audio summaries to catch you up on what you’ve already read so far.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify says the new Audiobook Charts will benefit both readers and authors by giving listeners a trusted way to discover popular titles, while also creating new opportunities for authors and the publishing industry to reach wider audiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As we’ve proven with Music and Podcasts Charts, when content is easier to access, discover, and enjoy, the demand grows,” said Duncan Bruce, Spotify’s director of Audiobook Partnerships and Licensing, in the <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-02-27/audiobook-charts-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “We are delighted to now bring that to audiobooks, to help provide even more ways for users, publishers, and authors to discover what’s trending on Spotify, and make books more connected with culture in real time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Spotify isn’t only interested in audiobooks, as the streaming giant also recently ventured into physical book sales. Spotify announced earlier this month that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/spotify-ventures-into-physical-book-sales-adds-new-audiobook-features/\">purchase physical copies</a> of books directly within the app through a partnership with Bookshop.org.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
