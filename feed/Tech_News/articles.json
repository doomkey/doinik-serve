The company just released a truly and permanently open (Apache license) general-purpose, foundation model called Trinity, and Arcee claims that at 400B parameters, it is among the largest open-source foundation models ever trained and released by a U.S. company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arcee says Trinity compares to Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick 400B, and Z.ai GLM-4.5, a high-performing open-source model from China’s Tsinghua University, according to benchmark tests conducted using base models (very little post training).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?w=680\" alt=\"Arcee AI benchmarks for Trinity LLM\" class=\"wp-image-3086962\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Arcee-Benchmarks-trinity-large-preview-base.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Arcee AI benchmarks for its Trinity large LLM (preview version, base model)</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Arcee</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, Trinity is geared for coding and multi-step processes like agents. Still, despite its size, it’s not a true SOTA competitor yet because it currently supports only text. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More modes are in the works — a vision model is currently in development, and a speech-to-text version is on the roadmap, CTO Lucas Atkins told TechCrunch (pictured above, on the left). In comparison, Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick is already multi-modal, supporting text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But before adding more AI modes to its roster, Arcee says, it wanted a base LLM that would impress its main target customers: developers and academics. The team particularly wants to woo U.S. companies of all sizes away from choosing open models from China. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ultimately, the winners of this game, and the only way to really win over the usage, is to have the best open-weight model,” Atkins said. “To win the hearts and minds of developers, you have to give them the best.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benchmarks show that the Trinity base model, currently in preview while more post-training takes place, is largely holding its own and, in some cases, slightly besting Llama on tests of coding and math, common sense, knowledge and reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The progress Arcee has made so far to become a competitive AI Lab is impressive. The large Trinity model follows <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.arcee.ai/blog/the-trinity-manifesto\">two previous small models</a> released in in December: the 26B-parameter Trinity Mini, a fully post-trained reasoning model for tasks ranging from web apps to agents, and the 6B-parameter Trinity Nano, an experimental model designed to push the boundaries of models that are tiny yet chatty.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The kicker is, Arcee trained them all in six months for $20 million total, using 2,048 Nvidia Blackwell B300 GPUs. This out of the roughly $50 million the company has raised so far, said founder and CEO Mark McQuade (pictured above, on the right). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That kind of cash was “a lot for us,” said Atkins, who led the model building effort. Still, he acknowledged that it pales in comparison to how much bigger labs are spending right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The six-month timeline “was very calculated,” said Atkins, whose career before LLMs involved building voice agents for cars. “We are a younger startup that’s extremely hungry. We have a tremendous amount of talent and bright young researchers who, when given the opportunity to spend this amount of money and train a model of this size, we trusted that they’d rise to the occasion. And they certainly did, with many sleepless nights, many long hours.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McQuade, previously an early employee at open-source model marketplace HuggingFace, says Arcee didn’t start out wanting to become a new U.S. AI Lab: The company was originally doing model customization for large enterprise clients like SK Telecom. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were only doing post-training. So we would take the great work of others: We would take a Llama model, we would take a Mistral model, we would take a Qwen model that was open source, and we would post-train it to make it better” for a company’s intended use, he said, including doing the reinforcement learning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as their client list grew, Atkins said, the need for their own model was becoming a necessity, and McQuade was worried about relying on other companies. At the same time, many of the best open models were coming from China, which U.S. enterprises were leery of, or were barred from using. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a nerve-wracking decision. “I think there’s less than 20 companies in the world that have ever pre-trained and released their own model” at the size and level that Arcee was gunning for, McQuade said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company started small at first, trying its hand at a tiny, 4.5B model created in partnership with training company DatologyAI. The project’s success then encouraged bigger endeavors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if the U.S. already has Llama, why does it need another open weight model? Atkins says by choosing the open source Apache license, the startup is committed to always keeping its models open. This comes after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-meta-likely-wont-open-source-all-of-its-superintelligence-ai-models/\">indicated his company might not always</a> make all of its most advanced models open source. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Llama can be looked at as not truly open source as it uses a Meta-controlled license with commercial and usage caveats,” he says. This has caused <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://opensource.org/blog/metas-llama-license-is-still-not-open-source\">some open source organizations to claim</a> that Llama isn’t open source compliant at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Arcee exists because the U.S. needs a permanently open, Apache-licensed, frontier-grade alternative that can actually compete at today’s frontier,” McQuade said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All Trinity models, large and small, can be downloaded for free. The largest version will be released in three flavors. Trinity Large Preview is a lightly post-trained instruct model, meaning it’s been trained to follow human instructions, not just predict the next word, which gears it for general chat usage. Trinity Large Base is the base model without post-training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then we have TrueBase, a model with any instruct data or post training so enterprises or researchers that want to customize it won’t have to unroll any data, rules or assumptions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Acree AI will eventually offer a hosted version of its general release model for, it says, competitive API pricing. That release is up to six weeks away as the startup continues to improve the model’s reasoning training. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">API pricing for Trinity-Mini is $0.045 / $0.15, and there is a rate-limited free tier available, too. Meanwhile, the company still sells post-training and customization options. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Meanwhile, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform will remain free apps, but the new, premium features will be locked behind the subscription.

However, Adobe remains a fierce competitor with its expansive and detailed tools, which also run on iOS. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the AI features are powered by Apple Intelligence, like the visual and transcript search in Final Cut Pro, which runs locally on the device. Others involve the use of third parties, like OpenAI, which powers things like advanced image generation, Keynote slides, and presenter notes. Creator Studio’s AI features either are processed on the device or use a private relay to anonymize the traffic. Apple says these protections mean users’ content is kept private and never used for AI training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Zoox robotaxi was traveling along 15th street when a street ambassador named Jamel Durden opened the driver’s-side door of his 1977 Cadillac Coupe DeVille, according to MissionLocal, which <a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2026/01/sf-zoox-autonomous-car-crash-accident/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported the crash</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Durden’s hand was reportedly smashed during the crash, and the Zoox vehicle suffered damage to its glass doors. The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) told TechCrunch the Zoox vehicle was carrying a passenger at the time, which has not been previously reported. That passenger was an employee of Zoox, according to the company, and was not injured, which the SFPD confirmed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The police department declined to provide TechCrunch with an incident report “[d]ue to the fact it is still an open investigation.” Zoox filed its own police report about the incident, the company told TechCrunch, but said no additional details have been requested. In a statement on January 20, Zoox said it was “cooperating with local authorities to provide an accurate account of the incident.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, has also met with Zoox about the January 17 crash. The DMV told TechCrunch that Zoox filed a crash report “in compliance with California regulations.” That report is not yet publicly available. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox is in the early stages of building out its robotaxi service in San Francisco. In November, the company started offering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/zoox-to-begin-offering-robotaxi-rides-to-public-in-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free rides to members of the public</a> who are part of the “Zoox Explorer” early-rider program. The company is operating a similar program in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This rollout has come with challenges. The Amazon-owned company issued a recall in December to fix an issue where some of its vehicles were crossing center lanes and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/zoox-issues-software-recall-over-lane-crossings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blocking crosswalks</a>. (Zoox also issued <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/zoox-issues-second-robotaxi-software-recall-in-a-month-following-collision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two different software updates</a> during recalls earlier in 2025 before it started offering public rides.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The January crash in San Francisco happened when Durden “suddenly opened” the door of his car into the path of the robotaxi, according to Zoox. The company said the robotaxi “identified the opening door and tried to avoid it but contact was unavoidable.” (Durden’s employer could not be reached for comment.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox also said it offered medical attention to Durden, who allegedly declined. According to MissionLocal, Durden refused medical treatment until his car was towed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Safety and transparency are foundational to Zoox, and we are cooperating with local authorities to provide an accurate account of the incident,” the company said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just two outlet stores in the US and two full-price stores in London will remain. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is an important step for Allbirds, as we drive toward profitable growth under our turnaround strategy,” Allbirds CEO Joe Vernachio said in a statement. “We have been opportunistically reducing our brick-and-mortar portfolio over the past two years. By exiting these remaining unprofitable doors, we are taking actions to reduce costs and support the long-term health of the business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The typical Allbirds wearer knows that this kind of corporate speak is a thinly veiled way to say the current financial outlook of the company isn’t great.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Allbirds was founded in San Francisco in 2015 and quickly became the “it” shoe among startup employees (even TechCrunch staffers once received branded grey Allbirds shoes as company swag — is our current lack of matching footwear a recession indicator?). The shoes are admittedly quite comfortable, but ugly in a way that only unstylish tech bros would seek out (the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.allbirds.com/products/mens-wool-runners-natural-white?size=8&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=Shopping+%2F%2F+US+%2F%2F+Allbirds+Brand+%2F%2F+Catch+All&amp;utm_content=732888300402_172224032822&amp;utm_term=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=17505301853&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADfIYPmr9CJb3MXyCDqyvNC42DCrW&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAhOfLBhCCARIsAJPiopOxoDgXTeixpJTqA1IYjidffp9XgwMn_VpEmCynzgiflhtnRqdXKVgaAkA6EALw_wcB&amp;variant=28847739371600\">white wool runners</a> are cool in a minimalist way, though). They’re like Skechers, embracing comfort above all else, but they’re more expensive. And unlike Skechers, Allbirds did not create a line of footwear with the one and only Martha Stewart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the companies that its customers probably work for, Allbirds raised enough venture capital to secure an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trendy-sneaker-startup-allbirds-laces-up-1-4-billion-valuation-1539281112\">overly inflated unicorn valuation</a>, only to go public in 2021 and flounder. The company’s market capitalization is now about $32 million and its stock hovers at just a few dollars per share, but at least it has the very cool NASDAQ ticker symbol $BIRD.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t quite the end of the Allbirds era. The shoes remain available online, and while expensive, they are genuinely pretty good shoes. But perhaps it marks the end of an era in which working in tech seemed like the ticket to lifelong stability. Now, your company can only afford branded Patagonia vests if you’re working in AI, and even then, you might be haunted by an undercurrent of anxiety that the AI bubble might burst.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps this anxiety is fueling the next era of Silicon Valley style, in which everything needs to be as efficient as possible. Tech bros now wear Oura rings to track their biometric data, log their macros on MyFitnessPal, and eat Sweetgreen “Power Max” protein bowls with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eatingwell.com/sweetgreen-power-max-protein-bowl-11852250\">over 100 grams of protein</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that light, maybe it makes sense that people are so <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/were-not-nostalgic-for-2016-were-nostalgic-for-the-internet-before-all-the-slop/\">nostalgic for 2016</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Nvidia is the classic example: As AI companies build out data centers, they’re buying up billions of dollars of GPUs each month, turning Nvidia into the most valuable company on earth. But Nvidia has suppliers too, and looking at them can give us an even longer-term view of the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why we care about <a href=\"https://www.asml.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ASML</a>, a Dutch photolithography company that has become a key linchpin for the semiconductor industry. ASML is the sole supplier of the EUV equipment needed to make cutting-edge chips, making it a central supplier for the entire industry. When ASML does well, it’s because companies are expecting to sell a lot of semiconductors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And based on <a href=\"https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/q4-2025-financial-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the quarterly earnings released Wednesday morning</a>, the company is doing very well indeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The topline figure is 32.7 billion euros in net sales, which is a lot of money by any standard. But for our purposes, the most important figure is “new bookings,” which represent the new orders that came in this quarter. Looking at those orders tells us how much capacity chip manufacturers think they’ll need, based on the orders they expect from data center buildouts in the years to come.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By that metric, the AI infrastructure boom is still going strong. Last quarter, ASML brought in 13 billion euros’ worth of new orders, a new record for the company and more than double the orders that came in the quarter before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an earnings statement, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet made it clear the extra demand was coming from AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the last months, many of our customers have shared a notably more positive assessment of the medium-term market situation, primarily based on more robust expectations of the sustainability of AI-related demand,” Fouquet wrote. In non-CEO English, that means their customers expect AI labs will really need all the data centers they’re building, and they’re spending money now so they can be ready to supply the chips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear: None of this is guaranteed to happen. The future is unwritten! It may be years before all those orders are filled, and some clients may pull out before delivery time. The dreaded Zitron predictions could still come true and bring it all crashing down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if you were waiting for companies to back-pedal on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">the trillions of dollars in projected infrastructure spending</a>… you may be waiting for a while.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal flow is now extending to those critical suppliers in the nuclear industry. And <a href=\"https://www.standardnuclear.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Standard Nuclear</a>, which makes nuclear fuel to feed those reactors, is one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it has raised $140 million in a Series A round led by Decisive Point with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Chevron Technology Ventures, Crucible Capital, Fundomo, StepStone Group, Washington Harbour Partners, Welara, and XTX Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was completed in two tranches of $70 million each after Standard Nuclear hit milestones sooner than expected in the wake of President Donald Trump’s nuclear-related executive orders last year, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round comes seven months after Standard Nuclear <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/standard-nuclear-emerges-from-the-ashes-of-a-failed-startup/\">emerged from “stealth” with $42 million</a> in funding. Air quotes are required here; Standard Nuclear is built on the ashes of the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), which went bankrupt in October 2024. The bankrupt company had been working to commercialize a nuclear fuel called TRi-structural ISOtropic particle fuel, or TRISO, for years. Decisive Point’s founder, Thomas Hendrix, bought USNC’s fuel-related assets in the bankruptcy auction for $28 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TRISO fuel was originally conceptualized in the 1950s. Uranium particles about the size of a poppy seed are coated in ceramic and carbon. Those are then packed into larger spheres. Altogether, the design of the fuel pellets is supposed to be more resistant to melting down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TRISO isn’t widely used today. And yet, many nuclear startups say they’ll be using TRISO in their reactors. Standard Nuclear has said it has $100 million in non-binding sales for 2027. Its customers include Radiant Energy, another Decisive Point portfolio company, and Nano Nuclear Energy, which bought USNC’s reactor assets.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Standard Nuclear’s years of experience could put it in the lead.

You’ll have the space to check your messages or enter a password on public transit without thinking twice about who might be watching,” the <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/us/coming-soon-new-layer-privacy-five-years-in-making/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">company noted</a> in a newsroom announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company added that you will also be able to hide certain parts of the phone from onlookers, such as the notification pop-up area. Samsung said that it is using a mix of hardware and software to achieve its results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An online tipster who goes by the name of Ice Universe <a href=\"https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2016342843644883276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2016342843644883276%7Ctwgr%5Edd7bf76f32bb1c5a07b9402a989c1e901aaeb322%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D3087119action%3Dedit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">posted screenshots on X</a> about the feature, showing how the notification area blanks out at an angle.

As users enter private information, such as passwords, any onlooker could view these details. A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-iphone-security-theft-passcode-data-privacya-basic-iphone-feature-helps-criminals-steal-your-digital-life-cbf14b1a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported that thieves often watched users enter their passcodes and used that info to lock victims out of their accounts. To prevent this from happening, Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/apple-introduces-protection-to-prevent-thieves-from-getting-your-passwords/\">released a “Stolen Device Protection” update in iOS 17.3</a> that required users to use Face ID or Touch ID before changing sensitive settings or accessing saved payment methods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Samsung hasn’t given a definitive date of release of the feature or the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Reports suggest that the company will hold <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/galaxy-unpacked-2026-what-to-expect-at-samsungs-big-launch-event\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an event in February to launch the device</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In an open letter, tech workers also urged their CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE and speak out publicly against ICE’s violence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Employees calling for CEOs to take action are encouraged and want more to join the ranks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re glad to hear the CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic condemning the ICE murders,” the ICEout.tech organizers, whose identities remain unknown, told TechCrunch (before Cook’s email was leaked). “Now we need to hear from CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, all of whom have remained silent despite calls all across the industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Amodei, Altman, and Cook may be taking something of a stand — one in public, the other two internally — all three CEOs couched their statements with praise for Trump, as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cook said in his email that he had a “good conversation” with President Trump and appreciates “his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.” Apple employees were reportedly <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2026/01/27/apple-tim-cook-trump-alex-pretti/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">angry that Cook had attended</a> an exclusive screening of a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump hours after ICE shot and killed U.S. citizen Alex Pretti.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei applauded Trump’s consideration to allow Minnesota authorities to conduct an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/walz-trump-phone-call-minneapolis-minnesota-alex-pretti-renee-good/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">independent investigation</a> into the shootings by federal agents after multiple videos of Pretti’s death circulated online. It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-growing-number-of-republicans-criticize-trump-admin-response/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growing number of Republicans have begun to call for</a> an investigation, as well. (Amodei’s sister and Anthropic’s president Daniela Amodei <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniela-amodei-790bb22a_im-horrified-and-sad-to-see-what-has-happened-activity-7421695432667553792-w7Gx/?utm_medium=ios_app&amp;rcm=ACoAAAFOCx8BxhX6-8vVp2wm8_znw5rioYX7NR4&amp;utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_campaign=copy_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted on LinkedIn</a> that she was “horrified and sad to see what has happened in Minnesota…What we’ve been witnessing over the past days is not what America stands for,” she wrote.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">J.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, the Trump administration’s current AI-forward policies have helped fuel explosive growth at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic over the past year; OpenAI raised at least $40 billion and is in talks to raise another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/\">$100 billion at an $830 billion valuation</a>, and Anthropic has raised $19 billion and is in talks to raise another <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/sequoia-joins-gic-coatue-in-25b-anthropic-funding-at-350b-valuation-ft/ar-AA1UszTG?apiversion=v2&amp;domshim=1&amp;noservercache=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1#:~:text=Venture%20capital%20firm%20Sequoia%20Capital,Cisco%20(CSCO)%20and%20YouTube.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$25 billion at a $350 billion valuation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, such words of praise for Trump is an about-face for Altman. In the lead up to Trump’s first term in 2016, Altman posted the following to his <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">own blog</a>:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Trump] is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are…To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that time, he called Trump a “demagogic hate-monger” who dangles the lie that he will “Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders” to distract from the fact that he actually has “no serious plan for how to restore economic growth.” Altman acknowledged that he took some risk by writing his post, and ended on a quote that has been attributed to Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This would be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Amodei also appeared to be more passionate about his opposition to Trump allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/anthropics-ceo-stuns-davos-with-nvidia-criticism/\">calling the decision “crazy”</a> last week during the World Economic Forum and likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether these CEOs are doing everything that some among their workforce want them to do remains to be seen. Still, given what’s at stake for their companies, even internal and mild-mannered critiques are notable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spokespeople from Anthropic and OpenAI confirmed that neither company has contracts with ICE, but did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for more information. TechCrunch has reached out to Apple.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with comment from J.J.

This reduction comes after the e-commerce company laid <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/amazon-to-cut-14000-corporate-jobs/\">off 14,000 people in October</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a letter to employees, Senior VP of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, said that these layoffs were made for “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.” She noted that the reason for the second round of massive layoffs within three months was that several teams in the company hadn’t finished their restructuring.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Galetti didn’t outright deny that there might be more job slashes in the company, but said that the company is not trying to create a pattern of large layoffs every few months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate,” she said in <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October, Amazon said that it had 1.57 million employees, and had registered single-digit growth in the past five quarters prior to that, <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the company’s Q3 2025 filings</a>. The company is set to publish its Q4 2025 results next week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its latest blog post, Galetti said that despite these job cuts, the company will continue to hire in strategic areas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a memo that said because of AI, the company will need fewer people “doing some ofthe jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” He also indicated that the company’s corporate workforce will see a reduction in the next few years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon sent an erroneous meeting invite to numerous AWS employees that addressed job cuts and a “Project Dawn” initiative, confusing workers, as reported by Business Insider. The invite was canceled shortly after. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, Amazon said that it is closing its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/amazon-is-closing-its-physical-amazon-go-and-amazon-fresh-stores/\">physical Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh Stores</a> to concentrate on increasing capacity for same-day grocery delivery.

In anticipation of that big event, the company has launched a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., focused solely on further developing the glasses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap announced the new company on Tuesday, explaining that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment” as it continues to iterate on its product. It shows that, like other tech giants (see: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/\">Meta</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/03/apple-vision-pro-review-the-infinite-desktop/\">Apple</a>), Snap is getting serious about its smart glasses—although it’s worth noting that the company has been developing its AR hardware for quite a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, Snap originally began working on the technology behind Specs over a decade ago, although the last time the company offered a consumer version of the glasses <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/snap-introduces-spectacles-3-with-two-hd-cameras-and-3d-effects-on-snapchat/\">was in 2019</a>. Since 2024, the latest version of the hardware (technically its fifth generation) has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/17/snaps-extremely-large-spectacles-bring-impressive-ar-to-developers-at-99-a-month/\">a developer-only product</a>, which has allowed Snap to work on populating the wearable with the kinds of programs that will hopefully make it a hit when it comes time to launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Snap has continued to refine its product, other companies have charged to the front of the AR glasses race, most notably Meta—which has cut deals with major eyewear companies (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/?srsltid=AfmBOorDg1-iMererInvZnDlZ2h7GVQUHj-UqPy96Fa6ueFs2eo0FaJg\">Ray Ban and Oakley</a> via its partnership with those brands’ owner, EssilorLuxottica) while enjoying <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-pause.html\">growing demand in the U.S.</a> Snap obviously hopes to make a meaningful entrance into that market once its glasses are released later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES earlier this month, I met up with Russell Patton, product manager for Specs, who gave me the opportunity to demo Snap’s new headgear. Patton, who guided me through a tour of the device’s user experience and latest features, said that “the spatial nature” of Specs meant that there were a lot of user experiences that could be enjoyed that aren’t possible with a phone. That spatial experience is largely powered by the glasses’ four cameras, which allow for hand tracking and enable the company’s Snap Spatial Engine, which is the software component that projects the device’s AR imagery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specs run on a distinct operating system, Snap OS, which released <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/introducing-snap-os-2.0\">its latest version</a> last September. The newest version notably includes an improved browser (which I was able to test-drive by visiting the TechCrunch website), as well as an AI-powered function (dubbed “spatial tips”) that can provide auto-generated information about whatever you happen to be looking at (while staring at a table full of snacks, the glasses gave me tips for which were the healthiest). Also included is a “travel mode,” which Snap says can help travelers translate foreign street signs and menus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there are the games. During my demo, I managed to flail my way through a round of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, which was quite a lot of fun. The headsets also have the ability to synchronize with one another, meaning that two different people wearing different sets of glasses can see the same thing in the same physical space. As you might imagine, that opens the door for collaborative gaming.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The form factor of the glasses I used was a bit cumbersome (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/sps-2024-spectacles-snapos\">at nearly 8 ounces</a>, they’re a bit heavy), and it had a propensity to heat up after usage, although the team told me that the particular pair of glasses I was using had been in use all day. The physical makeup of the hardware is also expected to change before it launches publicly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hasn’t provided a firm release date yet, so interested consumers will have to keep their eyes peeled for that announcement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: the 3rd generation of Spectacles for consumers launched in 2019, not 2018 as previously stated.

The round included a new strategic investment by Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More investors, including newcomer Google, have piled in since, pushing the Series E to $425 million, the company said. Existing investors Capricorn and Goldman Sachs have also returned with fresh investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s valuation was not publicly disclosed, but a source familiar with the round told TechCrunch its post-money valuation was north of $6 billion, more than a billion higher than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/redwood-materials-raises-1b-to-expand-us-battery-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its previous valuation</a>. This latest investment pushes Redwood’s total capital raised to $4.9 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The attraction for Google, Nvidia, and others in this latest round appears to be energy storage — and its ability to power data centers — a newer business venture within Redwood.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Redwood Materials</a> was founded in 2017 to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries and laptop computers. Redwood processes that scrap and extracts materials that are traditionally mined, like nickel and lithium. The newly processed materials are then sold to customers such as Panasonic, which use them to make batteries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Redwood has continued to expand its business beyond recycling. The Carson City, Nevada-based company added cathode production several years ago, and last summer, launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/redwood-materials-launches-energy-storage-business-and-its-first-target-is-ai-data-centers/\">an energy-storage business</a> that repurposes EV batteries that aren’t quite ready to be recycled and turns them into micro-grids that can supply power to AI data centers and large-scale industrial sites.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That new business, called Redwood Energy, got its start as the demand for data centers skyrocketed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As electricity demand surges — driven by AI, data centers, manufacturing and electrification — energy storage is no longer optional; it is essential infrastructure,” the company said in a blog post announcing the new funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Redwood seems to have the means to power at least some of those data centers. The company said in June it recovers more than 70% of all used or discarded battery packs in North America, many of which can have a second life as energy storage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Redwood said last year it had more than 1 gigawatt-hour worth in its inventory and expected to receive another 4 gigawatt-hours over the coming months. The company expects to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours of grid-scale storage by 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The companies did not provide a timeline for such a large-scale deployment.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership represents a bet that the startup’s AI technology can succeed where others have struggled – scaling across multiple self-driving verticals with a single technology stack. While competitors like Waymo previously attempted both robotaxis and trucking before shutting down its freight program, Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun says her company’s capital-efficient approach and generalizable AI architecture give it a unique advantage to tackle both markets simultaneously. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our incredible core technology really enables, for the first time, a single solution that can do multiple verticals, and they can do them at scale,” Urtasun told TechCrunch. “It’s not about two programs, two stacks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up brings Urtasun’s work full circle: she previously served as chief scientist at Uber’s autonomous vehicle division, Uber ATG, which Uber sold to self-driving trucking firm Aurora Innovation in 2020. It also builds on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/waabi-and-uber-freight-partner-to-accelerate-autonomous-trucking/\">Waabi’s existing partnership with Uber Freight</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waabi is one of several AV companies that Uber has brought on to deploy self-driving vehicles on its platform globally. Other companies include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/waymo-and-uber-prepare-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-atlanta-this-summer/\">Waymo</a>, Nuro, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/uber-and-avride-launch-robotaxi-service-in-dallas/\">Avride</a>, Wayve, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/06/uber-and-weride-launch-robotaxi-service-in-abu-dhabi/\">WeRide</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/ubers-latest-autonomous-vehicle-partner-chinese-startup-momenta/\">Momenta</a>, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up and funding round come as Uber <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/uber-launches-an-av-labs-division-to-gather-driving-data-for-robotaxi-partners/\">launches a new division called Uber AV Labs</a> that will use its vehicles to collect data for AV partners.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waabi isn’t as reliant on data as some, if Urtasun is to be believed. The Waabi Driver is trained, tested, and validated using a closed-loop simulator called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/09/waabis-new-simulator-could-scale-autonomous-vehicle-tech-faster/\">Waabi World</a> that automatically builds digital twins of the world from data; performs real-time sensor simulation; manufactures scenarios to stress-test the Waabi Driver; and teaches the Driver to learn from its mistakes without human intervention. The result? Waabi’s Driver can reason about its surroundings as a human would and choose the best maneuver, says Urtasun. This allows the system to generalize and learn from fewer examples than traditional autonomous driving systems. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087058\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Waabi</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waabi has spent the last four and a half years bringing that technology to life for highway and surface street capabilities with trucks, but Urtasun says the Waabi Brain already generalizes to different vehicle form factors – she has even hinted at the company’s next vertical being robotics. From the beginning, the company collected and simulated passenger car data alongside its trucking work, a signal that robotaxis were always part of the long-term plan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The approach has allowed Waabi to build faster and cheaper than competitors, Urtasun claims. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t need the gazillion humans to develop the technology and the large fleets that AV 1.0 needs,” Urtasun said. “We don’t need the massive data centers, energy consumption, or a gazillion latest chips.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal brings Waabi’s total funding raised to roughly $1.28 billion after it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/waabis-genai-promises-to-do-so-much-more-than-power-self-driving-trucks/\">closed a $200 million Series B</a> in June 2024. Competitors Aurora Innovation and Kodiak Robotics have raised $3.46 billion and $448 million to date, respectively, through a combination of venture capital and public-market proceeds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In just five years, Waabi has launched several commercial pilots (with a human driver in the front seat) in Texas. The company had planned to launch a fully driverless truck on public highways by the end of last year, but the rollout has been delayed until sometime in the next few quarters, per Urtasun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waabi is working with Volvo to build purpose-built autonomous trucks, which the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/waabi-unveils-autonomous-truck-made-in-partnership-with-volvo/\">revealed last October at TechCrunch Disrupt</a>. Urtasun says Waabi’s Driver is ready to go, but the trucks still need to be fully validated before launch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Urtasun’s not worried, though. She says there’s plenty of demand for Waabi’s trucks due to the company’s direct-to-consumer model that enables shippers to buy the outfitted trucks directly, and she’s confident that with the Uber partnership, Waabi will be able to “quickly penetrate the market and scale with a product that will be very reliable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re still in the first innings of deployment of robotaxis,” she said. “There’s a lot more scale to come.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Urtasun wouldn’t share more specifics about the Uber rollout, like what automaker Waabi would partner with. She did say that Waabi would take a similar route to its autonomous trucking rollout by building its sensors and technology into the vehicle from the factory floor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe in vertically integrating with a fully redundant platform from the OEM,” she said.  “That is how you really build safe and truly scalable technology.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other investors in Waabi’s Series C include Uber, NVentures (Nvidia’s VC arm), Volvo Group Venture Capital, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, BlackRock, BDC Capital’s Thrive Venture Fund, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature, which Google first launched for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/20/you-can-now-talk-to-google-photos-to-make-your-edits/\">Pixel 10 users in the U.S.</a> last August, lets people describe the changes they want to make to their photos rather than manually adjusting sliders or learning complex editing software.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users in these newly supported countries will now see a “Help me Edit” box when they tap the edit option on a photo. From there, they can either select from suggested prompts or type their own requests in plain language. For example, you could ask the app to “remove the motorcycle in the background,” “reduce the background blur,” or use a more general command like “restore this old photo.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI can handle surprisingly specific requests too. You can ask it to edit a friend’s pose, remove their glasses, or even have them open their eyes in a photo where they blinked. The feature uses Google’s Nano Banana image model to transform photos, and all the processing happens directly within the app without requiring an internet connection for the actual editing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p><p>The feature will work on any Android device with at least 4GB of RAM running Android 8.0 or higher, meaning it’s not limited to Google’s own Pixel phones. Along with this geographic expansion, Google is also adding language support beyond English, including Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Bengali, and Gujarati, making the tool accessible to millions more users in their native languages.\n\n</p><p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also rolling out C2PA Content Credentials support in Google Photos for these countries. This metadata  will indicate when an image was created or edited using AI. As AI-generated and AI-edited images become more common, social media platforms have been grappling with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/meta-tagging-real-photos-made-with-ai/\">how to label AI content</a>, and credentials like C2PA help users understand what they’re looking at.<br><br>The expansion is the latest in Google’s aggressive push to integrate AI throughout Google Photos. Last November, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/11/google-photos-adds-new-ai-features-for-editing-expands-ai-powered-search-to-over-100-countries/\">expanded AI-powered search</a> capabilities to over 100 countries with support for more than 17 languages. It also introduced AI templates that can convert photos into different artistic styles. Just last week, Google rolled out a “Meme me” feature that lets users combine reference templates with their own images to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/google-photos-latest-feature-lets-you-meme-yourself/\">create memes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The offering, priced in a band of ₹118–₹124 per share, combined a fresh issue with an offer-for-sale by existing shareholders and was subscribed <a href=\"https://www.jmfinancialservices.in/market-news-and-insights/1666943\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nearly three times</a> over.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2015, Shadowfax <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/shadowfax-speeds-ahead-with-100m-funding-as-instant-delivery-boom-fuels-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">operates as a third-party logistics provider</a>, handling last-mile and intra-city deliveries for e-commerce marketplaces, quick-commerce platforms, and consumer internet companies across India. The company counts e-commerce players including Flipkart and Meesho, as well as quick-commerce and food delivery platforms Zepto and Zomato, among its largest clients, which together account for about 74% of its revenue, according to its prospectus. Its key shareholders include Flipkart, TPG NewQuest, Qualcomm, and the World Bank-backed International Finance Corporation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shadowfax’s listing comes as the e-commerce and quick-commerce sectors continue to expand in India, driven by rising internet penetration, urbanization, and demand for faster deliveries. Platforms offering same-day or rapid fulfillment have increasingly leaned on third-party logistics providers to scale nationally, placing companies like Shadowfax at the center of the country’s consumer internet supply chain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The offering includes shares sold by some early and institutional backers, including Flipkart, Eight Roads Ventures, Nokia Growth Partners, Qualcomm, and Mirae Asset. Shadowfax founders Abhishek Bansal and Vaibhav Khandelwal are not participating in the offer-for-sale and will together retain about 20% of the company after listing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t see this IPO as a destination,” said Bansal, Shadowfax’s co-founder and CEO, during its IPO launch ceremony in Mumbai. “We are not building this for the next quarter. We are building this for the next century. Today, we don’t ring a bell. We are waking up to a new set of possibilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the six months ended September 2025, Shadowfax reported revenue from operations of ₹18.06 billion (about $197.12 million), up 68% from the same period a year earlier, per its prospectus. The company’s profit more than doubled year-over-year to ₹210.37 million (around $2.30 million), reflecting higher delivery volumes, though earnings remain closely tied to demand from a small group of large platform clients.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shadowfax plans to use proceeds from the fresh issue to fund capital expenditure for its network infrastructure; pay lease costs for new first-mile, last-mile, and sorting centers; and meet branding, marketing, and communication expenses, its prospectus said. A portion of the proceeds will also be kept for inorganic acquisitions and general corporate purposes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company currently operates around 3.5 million square feet of logistics infrastructure across 14,700 pin codes nationwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shadowfax’s IPO comes more than three years after its larger rival, Delhivery, went public in 2022. Delhivery <a href=\"https://entrackr.com/fintrackr/delhivery-reports-rs-70-cr-profit-in-q4-fy25-revenue-jumps-6-9075735\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> revenue of about ₹89.3 billion (around $974.84 million) in the year ended March 2025, with year-over-year growth in the low teens, underscoring the contrast with Shadowfax’s faster expansion.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
