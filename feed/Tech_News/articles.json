The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-iphone-17-17-pro-and-17-pro-max\">iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/27/iphone-17-base-model-larger-display-rumor\">6.3-inch screen</a>, which is an increase of 0.2 inch compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-17-upgraded-120hz-panel-no-promotion/\">120Hz display</a>, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It’s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could also come in new colors: purple and green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pro’s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ankv6yBKNCM\">Conceptual renderings</a> show that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/PExRlau6t?pagetype=profilefeed\">leaker Instant Digital</a>, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro model could cost around $1,050. The Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-iphone-air\">iPhone Air</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035098\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=720,377 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=900,472 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=800,419 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=668,350 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=1177,617 1177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=708,371 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple Track</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/12/apple-may-add-an-iphone-air-to-its-lineup/\">the iPhone Air</a>, which may replace the iPhone Plus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inch thinner than current iPhones. It’ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This move appears to be Apple’s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/apple-reportedly-developing-foldable-iphone-and-ipad/\">Apple’s long-rumored foldable phone</a>, predicted to launch in September 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2845273/take-a-look-at-the-iphone-17-air-in-all-4-rumored-colors.html\">renders</a> we’ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/25/iphoen-17-air-design-features/\">rumors</a> that there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-apple-watch-series-11-ultra-3-and-se-3\">Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2851038\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it’s speculated that the watch will feature a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-watch-ultra-3-display-size/\">larger display</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q\">may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn’t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-airpods-pro-3\">AirPods Pro 3</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035153\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=300,222 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=680,504 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=430,319 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=720,534 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=668,495 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=506,375 506w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=708,525 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it’s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/ios-26-code-airpods-pro-3/\">Rumors</a> suggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case.

Although these documents are loaded with legalese, it’s clear that both economic developments are on the minds of their respective executive teams. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian and Lucid both make specific and multiple mentions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in the risk factors section of their 10Qs. The OBBBA eliminates certain tax credits for EV buyers and essentially devalues the zero-emissions regulatory credit market. Tariffs and trade policy risks also make cameos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000181121025000007/lcid-20250630.htm\">notes in its 10Q</a> that it is assessing the impact of OBBBA. “If any of the Company’s suppliers, sub-suppliers or partners experience financial distress, insolvency or disruptions in operations, they may be unable to fulfill their obligations or meet the Company’s production and quality requirements.”  Meanwhile, Rivian tries to strike a “glass half full” tone by noting that 45X tax credit for domestic battery production remains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford and GM also make mention of the OBBBA, although both spend more time talking about the potential effects of tariffs. GM says it’s unable to estimate the financial impacts of the OBBBA, but notes it “could be material and may adversely affect electric vehicle profitability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s the unfortunate upshot (and potential third punch): A new <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/trump-says-hell-announce-semiconductor-and-chip-tariffs/\">100% import tariff</a> on semiconductor chips could squeeze automakers even more. Anyone who paid attention during the COVID pandemic remembers how <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/business/auto-semiconductors-general-motors-mercedes.html\">supply constraints on chips</a> hurt automakers. Industry experts estimate that a modern vehicle contains more than 1,000 — and in some cases more than 3,000 — chips. None of these companies want to go through this again. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question is how they will qualify for exemptions; the Trump administration said it will award them to companies that manufacture the chips domestically. Automakers don’t typically make chips, which means these companies may all turn to domestic suppliers. This is, of course, a TBD scenario since the administration has a history of changing policy, and it has yet to provide details on this 100% tariff and exactly how to secure an exemption. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end result is uncertainty, the wet blanket of any enterprise.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You would think that a trade war with China and concerns about protecting American technology would discourage Chinese companies from setting up shop in the U.S. But lately, I have heard some chatter from a few birds in the industry that Chinese companies, specifically those working on autonomous vehicle technology or adjacent tech, are repatriating to the United States.

The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/joby-aviation-to-buy-blade-air-mobilitys-ride-share-business/\">deal is worth up to $125 million</a> and includes the Blade brand and its passenger business, which has operations in the United States and Europe. Blade’s medical division isn’t included in the transaction and will remain a separate company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal will continue to lead the business, which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Joby.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I wasn’t exactly expecting this deal, but it sure does make sense. Blade has sought partnerships with other electric aircraft companies, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/wisk-aero-and-blade-urban-air-mobility-partner-to-bring-electric-air-taxi-services-to-the-skies/\">including Wisk</a>.

Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport, as well as in Manhattan’s West Side and East Side and on Wall Street.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Drone startup<strong> </strong><strong>Destinus</strong>, which supplies weapons to Ukraine, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-05/dronemaker-destinus-to-buy-ai-aviation-firm-daedalean-for-223-million?srnd=phx-deals\">plans to buy Daedalean</a>, a Swiss company developing autopilot systems for aviation.

There is some considerable backstory here, so I recommend <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/federal-regulators-give-zoox-an-exemption-for-its-custom-built-robotaxis/\">reading my article.</a> TL;DR: This clears up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox robotaxis complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards. It also puts an end to a related investigation into whether the Amazon-owned company had sidestepped federal regulations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <strong>Tesla</strong> news cycle just won’t quit. And for some, it may feel contradictory. The company’s board of directors approved a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk worth <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/tesla-hands-29b-comp-package-to-elon-musk-amid-ai-talent-war/\">around $29 billion in shares</a>, with the company citing the “ever-intensifying AI talent war and Tesla’s position at a critical inflection point” as reasons for the payout. Meanwhile, Tesla, which has seen automotive revenues drop, is pushing to turn its AI and autonomy ambitions into moneymakers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two developments this week have chipped away at those aspirations. First, Tesla has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/tesla-shuts-down-dojo-the-ai-training-supercomputer-that-musk-said-would-be-key-to-full-self-driving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shuttered its Dojo supercomputer program</a>, ending its bid to develop in-house chips for driverless technology. And separately, a jury found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash and ordered it to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/tesla-partly-liable-in-florida-autopilot-trial-jury-awards-200m-in-damages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pay around $242.5 million</a> in punitive and compensatory damages. It’s a notable case in which plaintiffs successfully argued there is a gap between how Tesla talks about its Autopilot driver-assistance system and its actual capabilities.

In response, a member of Electronic Arts’ anti-cheat team, who goes by AC, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803\">wrote in an official forum</a> that the company saw players report 104,000 “instances of potential cheaters” over the first two days of the game’s being online, and that it stopped 330,000 “attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like many videogames today, such as Valorant, Electronic Arts uses a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#kernel\">kernel-level</a> anti-cheat system called Javelin, which means the system has the highest possible privileges on the computer. This allows it to monitor everything that happens on the machine with the goal of catching cheats, which are often running in the background and disguised as some other program. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you develop cheats, hack video games, or work in anti-cheat?

AC also referred to the fact that the game enforces Secure Boot, a Windows hardware-based security feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On Secure Boot, I want to be clear that Secure Boot is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet,” AC wrote. “Secure Boot is how you’re helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anti-Cheat isn’t one and done, it’s an ever evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn’t always work in all of them,” AC added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Electronic Arts spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company has no updated information on the numbers of players who were banned. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cheaters or game hackers are a problem for every online video game.

Those include banning cheaters, taking advantage of Windows’ own security features to limit where cheats can run, fingerprinting cheaters’ hardware so they can’t just create a new fresh account to cheat with, and even infiltrating cheat communities on Discord or Telegram.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Moving forward, Revel will instead focus on its nascent EV charging business, which includes operating five stations in New York and one in San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A visit to Revel’s app on Monday showed a message thanking users for “riding with us the last 4 years!” and announcing it has “permanently closed our rideshare service.” Revel’s website echoed the same message, adding: “Moving forward, Revel will continue to grow our Fast Charging business with more sites and cities opening soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have made the difficult decision that the best way we can keep the EV transition moving forward is by ending our rideshare service and focusing on building the fast charging infrastructure our biggest cities need to keep going electric,” Revel co-founder and CEO Frank Reig said in a statement to TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revel will sell or return the bright-blue Tesla and Kia vehicles that make up its fleet, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-11/revel-to-end-new-york-rideshare-business-to-focus-on-ev-charging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Bloomberg News</a>.

This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There’s even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are new servers for robotics workflows, too. The Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell Server offers a single architecture for robotic development workloads, while Nvidia DGX Cloud is a cloud-based management platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These announcements come as the semiconductor giant is pushing further into robotics as it looks toward the next big use case for its AI GPUs beyond AI data centers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us! <a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing.</a></em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1953660184351707210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted</a> late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity &amp; cost by a few orders of magnitude.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk has talked about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/tesla-dojo-elon-musks-big-plan-to-build-an-ai-supercomputer-explained/\">Dojo</a> since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/teslas-dojo-a-timeline/\">2019</a>, reiterating that Dojo would be a cornerstone of Tesla’s mission to achieve full self-driving and commercialize humanoid robots. Talk of Dojo halted around August 2024 when Musk began touting Cortex instead, a “giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if Cortex is still in the works. TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla to learn more, as well as to inquire about the fate of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-buffalo-factory-500-million/\">Dojo facility Tesla had invested $500 million</a> to build in Buffalo, New York. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift in strategy comes at a time when Tesla is experiencing falling EV sales and significant brand damage after Musk’s forays into politics. Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We want to get to know our audience even better, and get your feedback on our coverage and events. </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fill out this survey to give us your thoughts</a></em><em>, and get the chance to win a prize in return.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than <a href=\"https://corporate.ford.com/articles/history/moving-assembly-line.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">112 years ago</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And it’s a bet that began several years ago with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/ex-tesla-exec-leading-ford-skunkworks-project-to-develop-low-cost-ev/\">skunkworks team</a> of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/fords-secretive-low-cost-ev-team-is-growing-with-talent-from-rivian-tesla-and-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with talent</a> from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/FordUniversalEVProductionSystem_animation_16x9-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035701\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ford</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its <a href=\"https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/global-plants/louisville-assembly-plant.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Louisville assembly plant</a>, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us! <a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing.</a></em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The investors are betting on the team’s ability to pair local market expertise with execution and turn a notoriously difficult sector into a profitable super app for food, groceries and essentials.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re thrilled about this round as it brings us closer to our vision of becoming Africa’s number one super app,” CEO and co-founder <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ng.linkedin.com/in/femialuko\">Femi Aluko</a> said. “This funding will supercharge our growth plans, enabling us to expand into more cities, reduce delivery times, scale our grocery footprint, and attract the best talent to drive innovation and customer satisfaction.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in October 2021 by Aluko, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ng.linkedin.com/in/olumide-ojo\">Olumide Ojo</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/chowdeck-hopes-to-scale-notoriously-tough-food-delivery-market/\">Lanre Yusuf</a>, Chowdeck now operates in 11 cities across Nigeria and Ghana, serving 1.5 million customers with a network of more than 20,000 riders. Its logistics system averages 30 minutes per order, and in dense areas, more than half of deliveries arrive by bicycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While prominent players have exited or scaled back their African operations, Chowdeck has leaned into the complexity of local markets—delivering local meals, an operationally harder challenge—to build trust with customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, the value of meals delivered through Chowdeck grew more than sixfold from the previous year. This year, the company says it passed its 2024 total before July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding will help Chowdeck roll out quick commerce, ultra-fast delivery backed by a network of dark stores and hyperlocal logistics hubs. The company plans to open 40 dark stores by the end of this year and 500 by the end of 2026, with two to three new stores launching each week. Chowdeck <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/chowdeck-hopes-to-scale-notoriously-tough-food-delivery-market/\">raised a $2.5 million</a> seed round last year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035687\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=1200,638 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=1280,681 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=430,229 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=720,383 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=900,479 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=800,426 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=1536,817 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=2048,1089 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=668,355 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=1160,617 1160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=708,377 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Chowdeck</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Food delivery is a crowded business globally, but when done well, it has led to some other big companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/doordash-to-buy-uks-deliveroo-for-3-86b/\">DoorDash</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quick commerce, on the other hand, has been a capital-intensive gamble in most markets. In Europe, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/getir-acquisition-gorillas-is-death-knell-for-quick-commerce\">Gorillas and Getir </a>burned through hundreds of millions of dollars before retreating or consolidating. In India, platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/blinkit-signals-costly-battle-ahead-in-indian-quick-commerce-market/\">Blinkit</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/zepto-shifts-domicile-to-india-as-local-listings-gain-appeal/\">Zepto</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/swiggy-escalates-india-quick-commerce-battle-with-10-minute-meals/\">Swiggy</a> have had varying levels of success with the model when it comes to profitability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chowdeck has been profitable since before this raise and Aluko says the company doesn’t enter cities or verticals without planning to break even within a couple of weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, the food delivery platform <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techpoint.africa/news/chowdeck-launches-in-ghana/\">entered neighbouring Ghana this May</a>. Within three months, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/07/31/chowdeck-hits-1000-daily-orders-ghana/\">it was handling 1,000 daily orders</a> without paid advertising, which, according to Aluko, came from pent-up demand for a service that delivers local favorites alongside international cuisines. The company aims to quintuple that volume to 5,000 daily orders by the end of September 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aluko says Chowdeck plans to apply the same playbook to dark stores, which will complement its restaurant and grocery delivery operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another vertical complementing these operations will be software. This June, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://chowdeck.com/blog/beyond-delivery-why-we-acquired-mira\">the YC-backed startup acquired Mira</a>, a point-of-sale provider for African food and hospitality businesses. Mira’s tools manage inventory and orders in real time; now, it will help Chowdeck optimize its operations, positioning the company as a vertical SaaS-plus-logistics provider for restaurants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chowdeck’s raise is a win for local players in the sector, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/jumia-quit-food-delivery-because-of-deep-pocketed-aggressive-rivals-ceo-says/\">after Jumia’s exit</a> left market share to foreign brands such as Glovo, Bolt Food, and Yango. Yet, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcabal.com/2023/11/09/bolt-food-pulls-the-plug-on-nigeria-operations/\">some of these companies</a> have also withdrawn <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techpoint.africa/news/glovo-to-shut-down-in-ghana/\">from certain markets</a>, including Nigeria and Ghana, which Chowdeck is now targeting aggressively. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Super apps such as Gozem, YC-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/yassir-pulls-in-150m-for-its-super-app-led-by-mary-meekers-bond/\">Yassir</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/26/egypts-mnt-halan-banks-157-5m-gobbles-up-a-fintech-in-turkey-to-expand/\">MNT-Halan</a> are other local companies offering food delivery services in other African markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The market is still very early,” Aluko said. “Customer behavior is shifting online for the first time. A whole generation is growing up ordering food without ever having walked into some of the restaurants or markets on our platform.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For lead investor Novastar Ventures, the bet is on execution and local insight. “Chowdeck is building the future of logistics for African cities,” said partner Brian Waswani Odhiambo. “With deep local insight, a sustainability-first approach, and impressive execution, it is redefining last-mile delivery on the continent.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look-up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look-up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their car’s functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind-of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to login into multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal <a href=\"https://eaton-works.com/2023/02/06/toyota-gspims-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discovered in 2023</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But while most e-pharmacies chase speed, affordability remains the real challenge. <a href=\"https://www.truemeds.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Truemeds</a> took a different route: helping patients switch to lower-cost substitutes, a bet now paying off with new funding at about four times its previous valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The six-year-old startup has raised $85 million in a new round that includes $65 million in primary and $20 million in secondary funding led by Accel, along with participation from Peak XV Partners. TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/accel-eyes-stake-in-truemeds-at-330-million-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first reported on Accel’s talks</a> to back Truemeds last year. Existing investors WestBridge Capital and InfoEdge Ventures, also participated.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh round has boosted Truemeds’ valuation to over $400 million, up from the $110 million in its last round two years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2019, Truemeds entered the market at a time when India’s online pharmacy space was already crowded with major players offering steep discounts on branded generics. But some of those companies struggled to sustain early momentum — Prosus Ventures-backed PharmEasy, for instance, saw its valuation <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/pharmeasy-valuation-cut/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drop from a peak of $5.6 billion to under $600 million</a>, while <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/tata-digital-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-online-pharmacy-1mg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1mg was acquired by Tata Digital</a>, part of the Tata Group. Instead of competing head-on, Truemeds’ founders chose to focus on a relatively niche segment: generic medicines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is no way to educate the user that you can have more affordable options if you can’t afford these drugs,” said Truemeds co-founder Akshat Nayyar (pictured above, left) in an interview. “That is where we felt that nobody in the value chain was working towards that, and we can bridge that gap.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Mumbai-based outfit recommends generic alternatives to consumers for the branded medicines they need. This eventually helps consumers save money, as generic drugs are typically more affordable than their branded versions due to cost efficiencies in their development process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truemeds says its differentiated approach has paid off, with revenue growing over 66% year-over-year to ₹5 billion ($57 million) in the last financial year. The startup says it retains more than 50% of its revenue after 12 months and now serves an average of 500,000 customers each month, with a total of 3 million customers to date. Moreover, it says it now serves over 20,000 postal codes across the country, with more than 75% of its customers coming from tier-2 cities and beyond.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, educating customers about alternatives to their prescribed medicines — and convincing them to switch from branded drugs to generics — remains a challenge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Because you get anchored to your prescribed brand’s price, and when you suddenly see a lower price, you want to know why it is low,” Nayyar told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-increasing-discounts-while-competitors-cut-back\">Increasing discounts while competitors cut back</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While today’s e-pharmacies chase speed over savings, the sector’s early playbook was different. Online pharmacies in India used to offer discounts of up to 25% to attract customers. But Nayyar said this dropped to 20% and then 15% — the new average — as most burned cash to acquire new customers and pivoted to faster delivery as their main differentiator.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truemeds has gone in the opposite direction, increasing its average discounts from 29% to 32% in the last 12 months. For an average user who switches brands on the platform, savings reach 47% on their medicine, says the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This comes from Truemeds’ deep procurement relationships with pharma companies, where the startup uses its technology to give manufacturers better demand visibility, helping them plan production more efficiently for upcoming quarters, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also relies on its own logistics in some of the major cities it operates in and uses low-cost logistics partners for the rest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe that our four-hour delivery model is more than sufficient from a chronic patient’s perspective,” said Nayyar. “You’re able to do more planned purchases that way, but we want to do it in the most efficient manner, and pass more and more discounts to the end user rather than [focus on] the fastest delivery for that matter.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-next-up-ai-powered-customization-and-doorstep-diagnostics\">Next up: AI-powered customization and doorstep diagnostics</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Truemeds needs to convince customers to choose generics over branded medicines, it goes through deeper consultations with them. It already conducts 10-12 million consultations per year. The startup has developed an algorithm over the years that looks at various parameters to precisely suggest alternatives to the branded drugs a customer demands. It considers nuances such as whether the medicine is sugar-coated if it is for a young patient, where it is manufactured, and whether the plant is GMP-certified, among others. The startup also has a chatbot to address some user queries quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much more is on the roadmap. The company plans to develop an AI-based system that customizes conversations based on customers’ behavior and previous interactions with generic alternatives. It’s also opening a Bengaluru office while dedicating at least 20% of its capital to engineering and product development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond medicines, Truemeds is plotting to enter diagnostics through partnerships with national pathology labs, planning to pilot lab testing services in some tier-2 cities in the next three to four months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The primary mission remains the same, which is making healthcare affordable for the end user,” the co-founder said. “It started with medicines. Now that the model is getting established, we are going to keep scaling that. Simultaneously, we also want to see if we can do something similar on the diagnostics front, where we can be the lowest cost provider of at least the most common tests.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also plans to increase its fulfillment center count by 300% — from 19 currently — over the next 12 months, aiming to deepen its presence in existing markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before this round, Truemeds raised $50 million and still has 30–35% of that capital in the bank, Nayyar said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has a workforce of 2,800 people, with 250 based in its Mumbai office.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanford University has confirmed its admissions policies for fall 2026 will continue considering legacy status, a decision that could influence access to one of Silicon Valley’s most important talent pipelines. Stanford is also ending its test-optional policy, requiring SAT or ACT scores for the first time since 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/08/06/stanford-to-continue-legacy-admissions-reinstate-standardized-test-requirements/\">Stanford Daily</a>, the university is so committed to keeping legacy preferences that it’s withdrawing from California’s Cal Grant program, choosing to forgo state financial aid rather than comply with legislation signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom last fall — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-ab1780-legacy-admissions-donor-preferences-private-universities-gavin-newsom/\">Assembly Bill 1780</a> — which bans legacy admissions. The university promises to replace that funding with its own money.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanford has been the launching pad for numerous tech leaders, from the founders of Google, Nvidia, Snap, and Netflix, to many other renowned CEOs and VCs. With legacy admissions intact, children of Silicon Valley’s elite arguably maintain an advantage in accessing the network that has powered numerous tech booms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The return of test requirements adds another wrinkle, potentially favoring students with resources for test prep. While supporters believe it maintains academic standards, critics argue that for an industry built on meritocracy rhetoric, Stanford’s decisions represent a step in the wrong direction — reinstating standardized barriers and perpetuating inequality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanford last year announced said it would reverse its 2021 decision to remove standardized testing as an application requirement. That the university will continue to consider legacy status was revealed last week in newly released admissions criteria.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policies take on added importance given universities’ financial dependence on alumni support. Alumni donations are major financial contributors to educational institutions, particularly Ivy League schools. Princeton University, for example, received nearly half its donations — 46.6% — from alums in the 2022-2023 academic year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Stanford specifically, most donations are either directed toward annual giving via <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://giving.stanford.edu/the-stanford-fund/\">The Stanford Fund</a>, which spends the money immediately on current operations, financial aid, and other programs; or they are provided — more often — as gifts to Stanford’s massive endowment (managed by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://smc.stanford.edu/\">Stanford Management Company</a>), which spends roughly 5% annually on university operations, accounting for roughly 22% of its operating budget.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Universities depend even more heavily on alumni donations when facing external financial pressures, and new federal policies targeting higher education have created unforeseen and unprecedented budget issues for institutions like Stanford.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanford <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/stanford-university-layoffs-cuts-20803037.php\">confirmed</a> to the San Francisco Chronicle just last week that it will permanently lay off 363 employees, which is nearly 2% of its administrative and technical workforce, owing to what officials described as “ongoing economic uncertainty” and “anticipated changes in federal policy.” These include, most notably, a whopping increase in endowment taxes from 1.4% to 8% included in the Trump administration’s “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/the_one_big_beautiful_bill_act.pdf\">Big Beautiful Bill</a>” that was signed into law last month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That tax increase alone will cost Stanford an estimated $750 million annually.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By sending spam text messages that look like genuine notifications for popular services, from postal deliveries to local government programs, unsuspecting victims click a link that loads a phishing page, they enter their credit card details, and that information is swiped and used for fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a period of seven months in 2024, the scam netted at least 884,000 stolen credit card details, allowing scammers to cash in on their victims’ accounts. Some victims lost thousands of dollars in the scam, researchers say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a series of opsec mistakes ultimately led security researchers and investigative journalists to the real-world identity of the maker of the scamming software, Magic Cat, who researchers say goes by the handle Darcula. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/darcula-cat-photo.jpg\" alt=\"a photo of a profile picture of a prolific scammer, the picture is a white fluffy cat on a couch.\" class=\"wp-image-3035572\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/darcula-cat-photo.jpg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/darcula-cat-photo.jpg?resize=148,150 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/darcula-cat-photo.jpg?resize=296,300 296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/darcula-cat-photo.jpg?resize=370,375 370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/darcula-cat-photo.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>via Mnemonic</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As <a href=\"https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/exposing-darcula-a-rare-look-behind-the-scenes-of-a-global-phishing-as-a-service-operation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revealed by the Oslo-headquartered security firm Mnemonic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/the-hunt-for-darcula-1.17399157\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported in tandem by Norwegian media</a> earlier this year, behind the fluffy cute cat in Darcula’s profile photos is a 24-year-old Chinese national named Yucheng C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers say Yucheng C. develops Magic Cat for his hundreds of customers, who use the software to launch their own SMS text message scam campaigns at their victims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon after he was unmasked, Darcula went dark and his scam operation has not seen any updates since, leaving his customers in the lurch. But in its wake, a new operation has emerged and is already vastly outpacing its predecessor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Researchers are now sounding the alarm on the new fraud operation, Magic Mouse, which rose from the ashes of Magic Cat. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahead of sharing new findings at the Def Con security conference in Las Vegas on Friday, Harrison Sand, an offensive security consultant at Mnemonic, told TechCrunch that Magic Mouse has been surging in popularity since the demise of Darcula’s Magic Cat. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sand also warned of the operation’s growing ability to steal people’s credit cards on a massive scale.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During their investigation, Mnemonic found photos from inside the operation posted in a Telegram channel that Darcula administered, showing a line-up of credit card payment terminals and videos showing racks with dozens of phones used for automating the sending of messages to victims. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scammers use the card details in mobile wallets on phones and conduct payment fraud, laundering their funds into other bank accounts. Some of the phones had mobile wallets overflowing with other people’s stolen cards, ready to be used for mobile transactions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sand told TechCrunch that Magic Mouse is already responsible for the theft of at least 650,000 credit cards a month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While evidence suggests Magic Mouse is an entirely new operation, coded by new developers and likely unrelated to Darcula, much of Magic Mouse’s success stems from the new operators stealing the phishing kits that made its predecessor’s software so popular. Sand said these kits contain hundreds of phishing sites that Magic Cat used to mimic the legitimate web pages of major tech giants, popular consumer services, and delivery firms, all designed to trick victims into handing over their credit card details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But despite the prolific nature of Magic Cat and, now, Magic Mouse, and their ability to net millions of dollars in stolen funds from consumers, Sand told TechCrunch in a call that law enforcement is not looking beyond a few scattered reports of fraud or at the wider operation behind the scheme. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, Sand said, it is the tech companies and financial giants who shoulder much of the responsibility for allowing these scams to exist and thrive, and for not making it more difficult for scammers to use stolen cards. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for anyone who receives a suspicious text, ignoring an unwanted message might be the best policy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We want to talk with you quickly about something important. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve discovered that scammers are impersonating TechCrunch reporters and event leads and reaching out to companies, pretending to be our staff when they absolutely are not. These bad actors are using our name and reputation to try to dupe unsuspecting businesses. It drives us crazy and infuriates us on your behalf.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anecdotally, this isn’t just happening to us; fraudsters are exploiting the trust that comes with established news brands to get their foot in the door with companies across the media industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s an example of the most common scheme we’ve been tracking: Impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company’s products and requesting an introductory call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sharp-eyed recipients sometimes catch discrepancies in email addresses that don’t match our real employees’ credentials. But these schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters’ writing styles and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. Equally troubling, victims who agree to phone interviews tell us the fraudsters use those exchanges to dig for even more proprietary details. (A PR rep <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/17/pr-phishing-scams-fake-journalists-ai\">told Axios</a> that someone posing as a TechCrunch reporter raised suspicions when they shared a scheduling link.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why are they doing this? We don’t know, though a reasonable guess is that these are groups looking for initial access to a network or other sensitive information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they’re legitimate, please don’t just take their word for it. We’ve made it easy for you to verify.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Start by checking our <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/about-techcrunch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch staff page</a>. It’s the quickest way to see if the person contacting you actually works here. If the individual’s name isn’t on our roster, you’ve got your answer right there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you do see someone’s name on our staff page, but our employee’s job description doesn’t square with the request you are receiving (i.e., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business!), a bad actor may be trying to con you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask. You can learn how to reach each writer, editor, sales executive, marketing guru, and events team member in our bios.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We know it’s frustrating to have to double-check media inquiries, but these groups are counting on you not taking that extra step. By being vigilant about verification, you’re not just protecting your own company — you’re helping preserve the trust that legitimate journalists depend on to do their jobs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,” Altman promised.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. “We are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,” he wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Altman also promised, “We are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.” This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Predictably, he was also asked about the wildly inaccurate chart the team presented during the live presentation that quickly became the butt of many <a href=\"https://x.com/EMostaque/status/1953503036501877053\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“chart crime” jokes</a>.

Now that app is being discontinued, Microsoft says, as it directs its users to its Copilot AI chat app instead.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a new support <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/retirement-of-microsoft-lens-fc965de7-499d-4d38-aeae-f6e48271652d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">document</a>, Lens will be retired from iOS and Android devices starting on September 15, 2025, then removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play on November 15, 2025. Existing users will be able to continue to use the app’s scanning capabilities through December 15, 2025. After that date, no new scans will be possible, but access to prior scans will remain in the app as long as it stays on the user’s device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First launched in 2015, Microsoft Lens (then known as Office Lens) evolved from an application originally designed for Windows Phone devices. While its core functionality was similar to other mobile scanning applications, it didn’t try to upcharge users for certain functionality or push them into a subscription — a rarity in today’s App Store.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?w=351\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035556\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=155,300 155w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=351,680 351w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=222,430 222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=372,720 372w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=345,668 345w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=194,375 194w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=319,617 319w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=274,531 274w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Microsoft</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, it performed its task of turning any note — handwritten or otherwise — document, receipt, business card, or even whiteboard scribbles into the file format of your choice, like PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, or images. It also offered a variety of built-in filters to enhance the resulting image, lighten the document, turn it into a sharper black-and-white copy, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You could then save the file to one of Microsoft’s apps, other online services, or your camera roll.

While <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/try-copilot-chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Copilot</a> can handle scanning, it doesn’t support saving those scans directly to OneNote, Word, or PowerPoint, nor does it save business card scans to OneNote. It also lacks Lens’ accessibility features like read-out-loud and <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-immersive-reader-in-word-a857949f-c91e-4c97-977c-a4efcaf9b3c1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Immersive Reader</a> integration, the site notes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its age, Lens remains fairly popular, having pulled in over 322,000 downloads on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-lens-pdf-scanner/id975925059\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">App Store</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google Play</a> over the past 30 days, according to data from app intelligence provider Appfigures.
