If a match is found, that camera owner receives an alert and can optionally choose to share any related video clips with their neighbor who reported the pet missing. They’ll also have an option to call the owner or send them a message, without sharing their own phone number. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> Ring says the feature has been reuniting more than a dog per day since its launch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, Search Party was only available to customers with a Ring camera installed. The company is now making Search Party accessible to anyone through the Ring app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now, pet owners can mobilize the whole community—and communities are empowered to help—to find lost pets more effectively than ever before,” noted Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, in an <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-search-party-for-dogs-united-states-missing-pets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement</a>. “That’s why we believe it’s so important to make this feature available to anyone who shares a lost dog post in Neighbors,” he added, referring to the company’s Neighbors app for Ring customers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Search Party | A New Way to Neighbor\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQMuDtsLv0g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the launch and expansion, Amazon-owned Ring said it’s committing $1 million to equip animal shelters with Ring camera systems, and aims to aid 4,000 U.S. shelters. By adding the shelters to Ring’s network, the company hopes more lost dogs will be reunited with their owners.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company already works with other nonprofits, including Petco Love and Best Friends Animal Society, and is open to other partnerships.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This model recognizes plant species instantly and allows farmers to target new weeds without needing to retrain the robots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The LPM is trained on more than 150 million photos and data points collected by the company’s machines across the more than 100 farms in 15 countries where the robots currently operate. The model now powers Carbon AI, the AI system that serves as the brains inside the company’s autonomous weed-killing robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paul Mikesell, the founder and CEO of Carbon Robotics, told TechCrunch that prior to LPM, every time a new type of weed would show up on a farm — or even the same type of weed in different soil or with a slightly different appearance — the company would have to create new data labels to retrain its machines to recognize the plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This process took about 24 hours each time, Mikesell said. Now, LPM can learn a new weed instantly, even if it’s never seen it before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The farmer can live in real time and say, ‘Hey, this is a new weed. I want you to kill this,’ and that was something that had never been done before,” Mikesell said. “There’s no new labeling or retraining because the Large Plant Model understands, at a much deeper level, what it’s looking at and the type of plant.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mikesell said that the company, which was founded in 2018, started developing this model shortly after it began shipping its first machines in 2022. Mikesell has years of experience building these types of neural networks from previous roles at Uber and working on Meta’s Oculus virtual reality headsets.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new model will reach the company’s existing systems through a software update. From there, farmers can tell the machine what to kill and what to protect by selecting photos that the machine has collected in the robot’s user interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Carbon Robotics has raised more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/11/carbons-laser-weeding-robots-score-another-30-million/\">$185 million in venture capital</a> from backers including Nvidia NVentures, Bond, and Anthos Capital, among others. Now, the company will look to continue to fine-tune the model as the machines continue to feed the LPM new data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have over 150 million labeled plants now in our training set,” Mikesell said. “We have enough data now that we should be able to look at any picture and decide what kind of plant that is, what species it is, what it’s related to, what its structure is like, without having ever even seen that particular plant before, because we have so much data going into the neural net.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to some reports, Grok generated <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">thousands</a> of nonconsensual explicit images every hour, which were then disseminated at scale on X, Musk’s social media platform that’s owned by xAI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is deeply concerning that the federal government would continue to deploy an AI product with system-level failures resulting in generation of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material,” the letter, signed by advocacy groups like Public Citizen, Center for AI and Digital Policy, and Consumer Federation of America, reads. “Given the administration’s executive orders, guidance, and the recently passed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/trump-signs-bill-criminalizing-revenge-porn-and-explicit-deepfakes/\">Take It Down Act</a> supported by the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/icymi-president-trump-signs-take-it-down-act-into-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">White House</a>, it is alarming that [Office of Management and Budget] has not yet directed federal agencies to decommission Grok.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI reached an agreement last September with the General Services Administration (GSA), the government’s purchasing arm, to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/elon-musks-xai-offers-grok-to-federal-government-for-42-cents/\">sell Grok to federal agencies</a> under the executive branch. Two months before, xAI — alongside Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI — secured a contract worth up to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/14/xai-pentagon-grok-contract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$200 million</a> with the Department of Defense. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid the scandals on X in mid-January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Grok will join Google’s Gemini in <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pentagon-embraces-musks-grok-ai-chatbot-as-it-draws-global-outcry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">operating inside the Pentagon network</a>, handling both classified and unclassified documents, which experts say is a national security risk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter’s authors argue that Grok has proven itself incompatible with the administration’s requirements for AI systems. According to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-22-Driving-Efficient-Acquisition-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Government.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OMB’s guidance</a>, systems that present severe and foreseeable risks that cannot be adequately mitigated must be discontinued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our primary concern is that Grok has pretty consistently shown to be an unsafe large language model,” JB Branch, a Public Citizen Big Tech accountability advocate and one of the letter’s authors, told TechCrunch. “But there’s also a deep history of Grok having a variety of meltdowns, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/18/grok-says-its-skeptical-about-holocaust-death-toll-then-blames-programming-error/\">antisemitic</a> rants, sexist rants, sexualized images of women and children.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several governments have demonstrated an unwillingness to engage with Grok following its behavior in January, which builds on a series of incidents including the generation of antisemitic posts on X and calling itself “MechaHitler.” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/\">Indonesia, Malaysia</a>, and the Philippines all blocked access to Grok (they’ve <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/indonesia-conditionally-lifts-ban-on-grok/\">subsequently lifted those bans</a>), and the European Union, the U.K., South Korea, and India are actively investigating xAI and X regarding data privacy and the distribution of illegal content. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter also comes a week after Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews media and tech for families, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/among-the-worst-weve-seen-report-slams-xais-grok-over-child-safety-failures/\">published a damning risk assessment</a> that found Grok is among the most unsafe for kids and teens. One could argue that, based on the findings of the report — including Grok’s propensity to offer unsafe advice, share information about drugs, generate violent and sexual imagery, spew conspiracy theories, and generate biased outputs — Grok isn’t all that safe for adults either.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you know that a large language model is or has been declared unsafe by AI safety experts, why in the world would you want that handling the most sensitive data we have?” Branch said. “From a national security standpoint, that just makes absolutely no sense.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Christianson, a former National Security Agency contractor and current founder of <a href=\"https://gobii.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gobbi AI</a>, a no-code AI agent platform for classified environments, says that using closed-source LLMs in general is a problem, particularly for the Pentagon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Closed weights means you can’t see inside the model, you can’t audit how it makes decisions,” he said. “Closed code means you can’t inspect the software or control where it runs. The Pentagon is going closed on both, which is the worst possible combination for national security.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These AI agents aren’t just chatbots,” Christianson added. “They can take actions, access systems, move information around. You need to be able to see exactly what they’re doing and how they’re making decisions. Open source gives you that. Proprietary cloud AI doesn’t.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The risks of using corrupted or unsafe AI systems spill out beyond national security use cases. Branch pointed out that an LLM that’s been shown to have biased and discriminatory outputs could produce disproportionate negative outcomes for people as well, especially if used in departments involving housing, labor, or justice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the OMB has yet to publish its consolidated 2025 federal AI use case inventory, TechCrunch has reviewed the use cases of several agencies — most of which are either not using Grok or are not disclosing their use of Grok. Aside from the DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services also appears to be actively using Grok, mainly for scheduling and managing social media posts and generating first drafts of documents, briefings, or other communication materials. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Branch pointed to what he sees as a philosophical alignment between Grok and the administration as a reason for overlooking the chatbot’s shortcomings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Grok’s brand is being the ‘anti-woke large language model,’ and that ascribes to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-anti-woke-ai-order-could-reshape-how-us-tech-companies-train-their-models/\">this administration’s philosophy,</a>” Branch said. “If you have an administration that has had multiple <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/stephen-miller-trump-white-house/685516/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">issues with folks</a> who’ve been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/17/thousands-protest-elon-musks-doge-in-nyc-on-presidents-day/\">accused of being Neo Nazis</a> or <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/dhs-white-nationalist-anti-immigrant-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">white supremacists</a>, and then they’re using a large language model that has been tied to that type of behavior, I would imagine they might have a propensity to use it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the coalition’s third letter after writing with similar concerns in <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/news/new-letter-calls-on-omb-to-block-grok-implementation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">August</a> and <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/article/omb-urged-again-to-suspend-federal-use-of-grok-ai-over-accuracy-and-bias-violations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">October</a> last year. In August, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/grok-imagine-xais-new-ai-image-and-video-generator-lets-you-make-nsfw-content/\">xAI launched “spicy mode” </a>in Grok Imagine, triggering mass creation of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes. TechCrunch also reported in August that private Grok conversations had been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/20/thousands-of-grok-chats-are-now-searchable-on-google/\">indexed by Google Search</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to the October letter, Grok was accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/05/elon-musk-harris-grok-misinformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">providing election misinformation</a>, including false deadlines for ballot changes and political deepfakes. xAI also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/28/elon-musk-grokipedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched Grokipedia</a>, which researchers found to be legitimizing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/17/grokipedia-elon-musk-far-right-racist#:~:text='Policies%20preserving%20demographic%20uniformity',commitments%20to%20human%20genetic%20uniformity%E2%80%9D.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">scientific racism</a>, HIV/AIDS skepticism, and vaccine conspiracies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from immediately suspending the federal deployment of Grok, the letter demands that the OMB formally investigate Grok’s safety failures and whether the appropriate oversight processes were conducted for the chatbot. It also asks the agency to publicly clarify whether Grok has been evaluated to comply with President Trump’s executive order requiring LLMs to be truth-seeking and neutral and whether it met OMB’s risk mitigation standards.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The administration needs to take a pause and reassess whether or not Grok meets those thresholds,” Branch said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI and OMB for comment. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company says that it allows for all kinds of content and doesn’t shadowban or censor people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his speech, Hijazi called out big tech companies for being unethical and selling user data for profit, and accused social networks of suppressing pro-Palestinian content and choosing to censor users selectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They don’t care about selling your data to someone else if that means profit for them.

But users can always tell when they’re talking to a business — the texts are displayed in gray, and the branding is often obvious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq’s customers, though, wanted to be able to send blue-bubble messages to their customers, not green or gray, to lend an air of authenticity to their communications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, founded by former Shipt executives <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/RzgMCxo0l0UPwl3oTWuAHyfj3i?domain=de7f9591.streaklinks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elliott Potter</a> (CEO), <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/HRluCyp4m4hAk1R5iPC7Hx3Kvf?domain=de7f9591.streaklinks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Patrick Sullivan</a> (CTO), and <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/9dBxCzq8n8HO91AoCMFpH9dR_D?domain=de7f9591.streaklinks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jared Mattsson</a> (president), heard that feedback and launched an API in February 2025 that lets companies message their customers natively within iMessage, leveraging all the capabilities Apple’s platform offers to iPhone users, like group chats, emojis, threaded replies, images, and voice notes. Within eight months, Linq had doubled its annual recurring revenue it had built over four years, Potter told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq was not content with its newfound product-market fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called <a href=\"https://poke.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Poke</a> that can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage and was a key catalyst in the company’s refocusing on the agentic market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don’t have a CRM, but we really want to use your API’,” Potter told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poke <a href=\"https://x.com/interaction/status/1965093198482866317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">went viral</a> at launch last September, which, Potter says, led to his team being inundated with requests for tapping their messaging API. All of a sudden, a slew of AI companies wanted to offer their chatbots and assistants directly through iMessage, RCS, and SMS.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq now had a decision to make: stick with its original, steady revenue stream from serving B2B clients, or pivot once again to leverage its tech stack and become an infrastructure layer for a new segment of the AI market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We still love our sales customers, and we love that use case, but our choices were, do we stay a spoke of this wheel, or do we build the hub? Do we focus on being the infrastructure layer for all these different applications of programmatic messaging?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Potter thinks that consumers are suffering from app fatigue; but with Linq’s technology, there’s no need to use another app to interact with AI assistants as they can all live within their messaging app. Also, developers won’t have to worry about building an app since they can just build for a messaging-native interface instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Poke.com, along with others, have proved that AI has gotten good enough,” Potter said. “You don’t need a traditional app anymore to do things. Really, you just need an interface that will let you talk to an intelligent enough AI, maybe connect it to some of your systems, and just tell it what to do, and give it feedback.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq ended up pivoting, and it says its customer base has expanded by 132% from the previous quarter, and on average its customer accounts have expanded by 34%. Its customers’ AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/dont-trust-averages-how-to-assess-and-strengthen-the-health-of-your-business/\">net revenue retention</a> of 295% with zero churn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rosy outlook aside, the reality is that Linq is still building on top of Apple’s platform — at least for now. There’s no telling if Apple will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/whatssapp-changes-its-terms-to-bar-general-purpose-chatbots-from-its-platform/\">pull a Meta</a> and bar third parties from offering AI chatbots on its platform. Besides, iMessage is popular in the U.S., but the rest of the world also uses other messaging services like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Potter, however, says Linq’s eventual goal lies beyond messaging. “Our vision for the platform is everything you need to build conversational tech, and that’s not limited to a few channels. Right now, we have programmatic voice, we have iMessage, RCS, SMS. That’s just the beginning. Our ambition is, wherever your customers are, you should be able to talk to them, be it Slack, be it email, be it Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, anywhere your customers are, and can converse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By making AI-to-human communication as frictionless as texting a friend, Linq is enabling an entirely new category of companies,” Andrew Marks, co-founding partner of TQ Ventures, said in a statement. “Linq’s founding team is extraordinary, and we have no doubt in their ability to execute on this massive opportunity.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The social network has over 220 million users in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company blamed last week’s snowstorm, which caused an outage at an Oracle-operated data center responsible for TikTok operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have successfully restored TikTok back to normal after a significant outage caused by winter weather took down a primary U.S. data center site operated by Oracle. The winter storm led to a power outage which caused network and storage issues at the site and impacted tens of thousands of servers that help keep TikTok running in the U.S. This affected many of TikTok’s core features—from content posting and discovery to the real-time display of video likes and view counts,” the company said in a post on X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, the U.S. finalized the deal to create a separate entity for TikTok. A U.S.-based investor consortium called TikTok USDS took a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/heres-whats-you-should-know-about-the-us-tiktok-deal/\">controlling 80% stake</a>, with the remaining 20% ownership held by ByteDance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Following the deal finalization — which coincided with the snowstorm — users experienced glitches in features <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-attributes-recent-glitches-to-a-power-outage-at-a-u-s-data-center/\">like posting</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-attributes-recent-glitches-to-a-power-outage-at-a-u-s-data-center/\">searching within the app</a>, slower load times, and time-outs. TikTok noted that creators might see zero views on their posts until the problem was resolved. Later, the company said that it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/tiktok-says-its-still-working-to-recover-its-u-s-infrastructure/\">was working on solving the issue,</a> but outages persisted, and users faced problems with posting content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok’s transition to a new ownership structure, paired with app snafus and user experience glitches, was beneficial for some other social networks. The Mark Cuban-backed short video app Skylight, which is built on the AT protocol, saw its user base soar to more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-alternative-skylight-soars-to-380k-users-after-tiktok-u-s-deal-finalized/\">380,000 users</a> in the week the deal was finalized. Upscrolled, a social network by Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist Issam Hijazi, also climbed in App Store rankings to reach the second spot in the social media category in the U.S. The app was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/social-network-upscrolled-sees-surge-in-downloads-following-tiktoks-us-takeover/\">downloaded 41,000 times</a> within days of the TikTok deal’s finalization, according to analyst firm AppFigures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In addition to splashy features in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/article/tether-ceo-paolo-ardoino-crypto-firm-stabelcoins-howard-lutnick-usdt-cantor-fitzgerald/\">Fortune</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/tether-is-shaking-up-the-gold-market-with-massive-metal-hoard\">Bloomberg</a>, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino talked with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/tether-ceo-aims-allocate-up-15-its-portfolio-gold-2026-01-28/\">Reuters</a>, He also talked with TechCrunch. Why did the man behind the stablecoin that everyone loves to hate launch a full-scale media blitz?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing isn’t arbitrary. This week, Tether launched <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tether.io/news/tether-announces-the-launch-of-usat-the-federally-regulated-dollar-backed-stablecoin-made-in-america/\">USAT</a>, a U.S.-regulated stablecoin issued through Anchorage Digital Bank — its first product designed to comply with new federal rules and compete directly with Circle’s USDC. Fidelity Investments also just launched a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/28/fidelity-enters-crowded-stablecoin-field-with-new-fidd-token/\">competing stablecoin</a> on Wednesday, joining JPMorgan Chase and PayPal in a broadening race.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a big shift from one extreme to the other. For years, Ardoino avoided the United States, watching from offshore as regulators circled and prosecutors investigated. His company was portrayed as opaque, possibly fraudulent, and, according to a piece by The Economist last summer, a “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2025/07/04/how-tether-became-money-launderers-dream-currency\">money launderer’s dream</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But when Ardoino and I chatted by video call this week, it was clear those days are over. Tether is meeting with White House officials, collaborating with the FBI and Secret Service, and betting USAT can break Circle’s grip on the U.S. market. (USAT is separate from Tether’s flagship USDT, which has $187 billion in circulation globally but doesn’t meet new U.S. regulatory requirements.) Speaking from Lugano, Switzerland, where Tether maintains an office, the 41-year-old – who joined the company just two months after its 2014 launch – spent over an hour describing Tether’s transformation from a crypto play to mainstream acceptance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its momentum is undeniable, certainly. Tether’s USDT — essentially a digital dollar that uses blockchain technology to move across borders without being tied to any single institution — has a market capitalization larger than all of its stablecoin competitors combined. It also has some 536 million users, growing at 30 million per quarter. “It’s growing at a pace more like Facebook rather than any other fintech application,” Ardoino tells me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tether’s first-mover advantage goes beyond market dominance, says Ardoino, describing it as transformative for people in countries with weak currencies. “In Argentina, the peso lost 94.5% of its value against the U.S. dollar in the last five years,” he observes. “In Haiti, the average salary is $1.34 per day. These people were never part of the financial system.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What Tether created is the biggest financial inclusion success story in the history of humanity,” he continues.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ardoino knows he has a lot of work to do to convert more people into believers. It didn’t help when, last summer, The Economist detailed how <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2025/07/04/how-tether-became-money-launderers-dream-currency\">Russian money launderer Ekaterina Zhdanova allegedly used Tether</a> to connect British drug gangs, Moscow hackers, sanctioned oligarchs, and Russian intelligence operatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I bring up that reporting, Ardoino brushes it off, calling the amounts highlighted in the piece “truly a drop in the ocean.” The “infinite, vast majority of the usage of USDT is by good people,” he says, adding that the company now works with almost 300 law enforcement agencies across more than 60 countries. “iPhones are sometimes used by bad people, Toyotas are used by bad people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he goes even further, arguing that his company’s technology makes it superior to cash when it comes to monitoring illicit activity. “If there are cash pallets of hundreds of billions of dollars roaming around the world, U.S. law enforcement can hardly do anything about it,” he says. “But with USDT, we demonstrated that working with the DOJ, FBI, Secret Service and hundreds of other law enforcement agencies, we could quickly freeze the funds.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, according to Ardoino, Tether has frozen $3.5 billion in tokens, the vast majority of which belonged to “people who have been scammed or hacked.” In 2023, he says, for example, Tether proactively identified $225 million in a “pig-butchering scam” in the “blink of an eye” after traditional financial systems failed to catch it. (Pig-butchering scams involve scammers who befriend victims or even romance them over time before luring them into fake investments.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have onboarded the FBI and the Secret Service. We follow OFAC [the office that enforces U.S. sanctions],” he tells me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether critics are satisfied isn’t yet clear, but Tether has survived every attempt to bring it down. It’s an ongoing battle. Just three months ago, the S&amp;P Global Ratings called USDT’s stability <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/tethers-stablecoin-downgraded-weak-sp-assessment-2025-11-26/\">weak</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I raise this point, Ardoino is dismissive. “If that is the same S&amp;P that completely missed the subprimes, I’m proud they’re considering us weak.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He then points to spring 2022, when another major stablecoin called TerraLuna <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/12/terra-halts-its-blockchain-to-prevent-hacks-ust/\">abruptly collapsed</a>, wiping out $40 billion in value virtually overnight. Panic spread across the stablecoin market, and hedge funds bet Tether would be next to fail. Customers rushed to pull their money out. “We redeemed $7 billion in 48 hours – 10% of our reserves. In 20 days, $20 billion – 25% of our reserves. There is no bank in the world that can survive that level of redemptions. We did it with flying colors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ardoino also references a rival that didn’t fare as well during a separate bank run, though he stops short of naming it. The implication is clear — he means Circle. When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in 2023, Circle’s USDC briefly lost its peg after revealing $3 billion in exposure. When I ask Ardoino directly about Circle — often portrayed as the cleaner alternative — his PR team quickly interjects. He manages only: “Sometimes you are painted in a different light if you don’t bend the knee to Wall Street.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ardoino emphasizes that Tether now has $30 billion in excess reserves beyond what’s needed to redeem all outstanding tokens. What’s more, those reserves are held at Cantor Fitzgerald — the Wall Street firm that Howard Lutnick led for over three decades before becoming U.S. Commerce Secretary a year ago. Lutnick has publicly vouched for Tether’s legitimacy; meanwhile the firm earns fees from managing Tether’s massive Treasury holdings, creating a financial interest that now exists alongside Lutnick’s role shaping America’s commerce policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tether is now safer than traditional banks, is Ardoino’s point. “The banking system is doing fractional reserve at the length of 90%,” Ardoino says. “So if you deposit $1 million in a bank account, $100,000 is there, and $900,000 is lent out.” By contrast, he argued, “even if Bitcoin would go to zero, Tether would have more money than all the USDT tokens issued.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All those reserves generate enormous profits. According to Fortune, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/27/tether-15-billion-profit-lceo-strong-case-finance-leaders-embrace-stablecoins/\">Tether reported more than $15 billion in profit for 2025</a> derived largely from yield on reserves that — unlike with savings or checking accounts — it doesn’t share with USDT holders. When I ask whether Tether would reconsider sharing interest with its customers, Ardoino says that while interest makes sense for Americans who’ve come to expect it, it’s not top of mind for Tether’s core users, who are primarily trying to preserve value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Turkish Lira lost 81% of its value against the U.S. dollar in the last five years. The Argentina peso lost 94.5%,” he says. For someone whose currency loses 3% daily, a 4% annual interest rate is meaningless. “While for the rest of the world, U.S. dollar stablecoins are the savings account, you cannot think about stablecoins for U.S. people as the savings account, but more like a checking account.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There may be another reason Tether isn’t eager to share yields: pending legislation could make it illegal anyway. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3633/text\">The CLARITY Act</a>, currently moving through Congress, would prohibit stablecoin issuers from paying interest to holders, a move that banking groups support to prevent deposits from fleeing traditional banks. For Tether, its passage would simply codify its existing business model. For competitors like Circle, which have experimented with reward programs, it could eliminate a competitive tool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Beyond stablecoins</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ardoino’s ambitions extend far beyond USDT. Tether Gold, a token backed by physical gold that launched in 2020, now has $2.6 billion in circulation, meaning customers hold tokens representing that much gold. But Tether’s total gold strategy is far more ambitious. According to Ardoino’s Bloomberg interview, the company holds around 140 tons of gold worth roughly $24 billion, making it one of the largest private gold holders in the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I ask why Tether launched products like Tether Gold, he frames it as offering alternatives in an uncertain world. “Gold has been the first big, almost ubiquitous form of currency in humanity,” he says. “For the first time, with blockchain technology, we could actually make gold again a currency used not only as a store of value, but also a way to exchange value.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the gold product launched, “we were almost called crazy,” he recalls. Since then, Tether has been buying a whopping one to two tons per week, positioning itself as what Ardoino calls “one of the biggest gold central banks in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s the company’s push into AI that hints at Ardoino’s even grander plans. Roughly nine months ago, Tether rolled out <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://qvac.tether.io/\">Qvac</a>, Tether’s decentralized AI platform. The name comes from Isaac Asimov’s short story “The Last Question,” which Ardoino sees as the “most magnificent sci-fi piece of literature ever written.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His pitch for Qvac echoes his pitch for USDT, which is to serve the underserved. “USDT never meant to go after people that had an account in JPMorgan,” he explains. “We went to all the people left behind by the traditional financial system.” Similarly, centralized AI platforms will miss billions of people who can’t afford subscriptions, he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If they don’t have enough money for paying $150 per year for a bank account, they don’t have enough money to be onboarded on powerful AI platforms,” Ardoino says. Instead, Qvac will run locally on smartphones, as he believes within three to five years, today’s most powerful smartphones will be commonplace in Africa and South America, enabling up to 80% of AI use cases. “So USDT will empower the biggest decentralized AI platform in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s quite a vision, yet even Qvac is just another prong of a bigger strategy. According to Fortune, Tether has committed more than $1 billion to German AI robotics firm Neura, $775 million to social media platform Rumble, and hundreds of millions more to satellites, data centers, and agriculture. The magazine described Tether’s transformation into something resembling a sovereign wealth fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I note that from the outside, these investments — including a stake in the Juventus soccer club — seem disconnected, Ardoino insists they are not. “The motto of Tether is to be the stable company,” he says. “The reason why we invest in land, cattle, agriculture, modern tech, in gold – the common denominator is ensuring that Tether can remain a cornerstone of the world that is our user.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He describes it as an interlocking system where agriculture can be digitalized, gold markets revolutionized, telecommunications made peer-to-peer. “Our story is about building a company that can [stand] the test of time,” he says. “It’s becoming a social impact company that is changing the lives of hundreds of millions of people and providing them something they never had before – stability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And when I bring up political risks — what happens is the next U.S. administration views Tether as a threat, as did the last — Ardoino is ready for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I hope that financial inclusion and bringing 536 million people on board onto the dollar is something that both Republicans and Democrats care about,” he says.  “It’s a matter of education.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Ardoino is joining us at TechCrunch Disrupt, happening in San Francisco October 13-15. Don’t miss out on what’s sure to be the year’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2026/\">strongest industry event</a>.</em> </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In late December and January, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/grok-x-ai-elon-musk-deepfakes.html\">Grok was used to create at least 1.8 million sexualized images of women</a>, according to separate analyses by The New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.komdigi.go.id/berita/siaran-pers/detail/kemkomdigi-awasi-ketat-normalisasi-grok-usai-x-sampaikan-komitmen-kepatuhan\">a statement</a>, Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs said that it was lifting the ban after X sent a letter “outlining concrete steps for service improvements and the prevention of misuse” (translation <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/asia/indonesia-lift-grok-ban.html\">via The New York Times</a>). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space monitoring, said the ban is only being lifted “conditionally” and could be reinstated if “further violations are discovered.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Malaysia and the Philippines lifted their bans on January 23.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grok’s deepfakes have spurred criticism and investigations — but only a few outright bans — from governments around the world.

When Tesla acquired Solar City in 2016, he (and his comms team) pitched it as a sustainable energy company. Over the past year, he has pushed the idea of Tesla as an AI and robotics company. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s aspirational branding has slammed right up against financial reality: The bulk of its revenue comes from selling EVs. Its latest earnings support this. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company generated $94.8 billion in revenue in 2025. Of that, $69.5 billion came from selling and leasing EVs as well as related regulatory credits. The remaining $25 billion is split nearly down the middle between its energy generation (solar) and storage business and “services and other,” which include revenue from its Superchargers, parts sales, and Full Self-Driving subscriptions. That reliance on deliveries means that as EV sales have dipped, so has Tesla’s entire balance sheet. Its profits in 2025 were <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\">46% lower</a> year-over-year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has tried to grow its non-EV businesses to compensate for the decline in sales, and its Q4 and full-year earnings report (and its accompanying call) signaled a shift beyond the persistent AI-robotics talk and toward action. For now, that action involves spending money, not making it. Musk repeatedly stressed that 2026 would be a huge CapEx year, more than doubling spending <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-plans-20-billion-capital-spending-spree-push-beyond-human-driven-cars-2026-01-29/\">to $20 billion</a>, which would put them in negative-cash-flow territory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Musk announced that Tesla is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-is-killing-off-the-model-s-and-model-x/\">ending production of the Model S and Model X</a>, which is more symbolic than material. Those two models represent about 2% of Tesla’s sales volume, a point that Barclays analyst Dan Levy also makes in his most recent note. Still, it is a notable end-of-an-era moment for Tesla and the broader automotive industry, which was forever changed when the Model S went on sale in 2012. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more material move is what Tesla plans to do now. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla plans to fill the production void left by the Model S and X with its Optimus humanoid robots, which will be made at its Fremont, California, factory. Musk also intends to scale Tesla’s robotaxi operations to more cities in 2026 and even floated the need for Tesla to build a TerraFab factory to shore up chip supply. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the item that really stood out to me — and a true Elon Inc circular economy deal — was Tesla’s plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-invested-2b-in-elon-musks-xai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invest $2 billion</a> into another Musk company, xAI, and signaled plans to more closely align those two companies. Meanwhile, other outlets are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reporting</a> talks are underway to possibly merge (in some combination) three of Musk’s companies: SpaceX, Tesla, and xAI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But let’s come back down to earth for a moment and review Tesla’s current business. Its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\">sales are down</a> year-over-year, while its smaller energy storage business <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/teslas-energy-storage-business-is-growing-faster-than-any-other-part-of-the-company/\">made positive gains</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re not quite ready to share the full details, but we’ve heard from one little bird that there is some activity on the fundraising front for Waymo.

The autonomous vehicle startup has <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/waabi-raises-1b-and-expands-into-robotaxis-with-uber/\">raised $750 million</a> in a Series C round co-led by <strong>Khosla Ventures</strong> and <strong>G2 Venture Partners</strong>, plus another $250 million in milestone capital from <strong>Uber</strong> to support the deployment of 25,000 or more Waabi Driver-powered robotaxis exclusively on its platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber is already a Waabi backer, participating in one of its earliest raises in 2021. But this is about more than money. When Waabi first launched, it focused on applying its autonomous vehicle tech to self-driving trucks. The deal with Uber is a declaration that it intends to scale its tech across multiple self-driving verticals with a single technology stack. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Can Waabi do it? Others have tried and retreated. <strong>Waymo</strong> shuttered its self-driving trucks program to focus on robotaxis; <strong>Aurora</strong>, which is also an<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/ai-pioneer-raquel-urtasun-launches-self-driving-vehicle-startup-with-backing-from-khosla-uber-and-aurora/\"> investor in Waabi</a>, was working on both trucks and robotaxis, too, before deciding to focus just on big rigs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Gatik AI</strong>, a startup developing autonomous trucks focused on the “middle mile,” has signed a deal with a major (unnamed) consumer-goods company. Here’s why it matters: The contract will deliver <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://gatik.ai/news/press-releases/gatik-becomes-first-us-company-to-operate-fully-driverless-trucks-at-scale-for-commercial-deliveries/\">$600 million in revenue</a> over five years. And these are for driverless transport, meaning no safety driver is behind the wheel. These Gatik trucks, which run 24 hours a day moving ambient, refrigerated, and frozen goods between distribution centers and stores, have been operating driverlessly since mid-2025. According to the company, it has completed 60,000 fully driverless orders without incident. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Luminar’s</strong> lidar business has been sold for $33 million to Redmond, Washington-based <strong>MicroVision</strong>. The company, which is developing its own sensors, beat out Quantum Computing in an auction for the assets. TC’s Sean O’Kane <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/luminar-receives-a-larger-33-million-bid-for-its-lidar-business/\">interviewed</a> MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos about his plans for Luminar. The sales process did have a bit of last-minute intrigue when a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/luminar-sale-approved-despite-last-minute-mystery-bid/\">mystery bidder</a>, with a far larger offer, made a play for Luminar’s lidar business.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>, which started the bankruptcy process about a month ago, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/rad-power-bikes-reaches-deal-to-sell-itself-for-13-2-million/\">reached a deal</a> to sell itself to Life Electric Vehicles Holdings (or Life EV) for around $13.2 million. When accounting for Rad Power’s liabilities, the total value of the bid is $14.9 million. History lesson: Rad Power has raised $329.2 million since its founding and once had a valuation of $1.65 billion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Redwood Materials</strong> raised $425 million in a Series E round that includes Google as a new investor. The round was led by venture firm Eclipse and includes a strategic investment by Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures, as well as existing investors Capricorn and Goldman Sachs. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/redwood-attracts-google-for-its-425m-series-e-as-ai-power-needs-rise/\">Read the full story</a> to learn what Redwood plans to do with the capital. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-notable-reads-and-other-tidbits\">Notable reads and other tidbits</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1926823\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,193 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,171 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=430,108 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=720,181 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=900,226 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=800,201 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=668,168 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=708,178 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Obi</strong>, a company that aggregates real-time pricing and pickup times across multiple ride-hailing services, shared new data on ride-hailing and robotaxis in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Amazon has also stepped up its spending in December, saying it would invest an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/amazon-to-invest-additional-35b-in-india-by-2030-taking-total-planned-spending-to-75b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">additional $35 billion</a> in India by 2030, taking its total planned commitment to about $75 billion as it expands its retail and cloud operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s domestic data-center sector is also ramping up to meet global demand. In November, Digital Connexion, a joint venture backed by Reliance Industries, Brookfield Asset Management, and Digital Realty Trust, said it would <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-27/reliance-venture-to-build-11-billion-ai-data-center-in-india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invest $11 billion</a> by 2030 to develop a 1-gigawatt, AI-focused data center campus in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The project, spanning about 400 acres in Visakhapatnam, is among the largest announced in India and underscores growing interest from both domestic and global investors in building AI-ready infrastructure in the country. Separately, Adani Group said in December it plans to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/indias-adani-seeks-up-5-billion-investment-google-data-center-join-ai-boom-2025-11-28/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invest up to $5 billion</a> alongside Google in its AI data center project in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, scaling up data center capacity in India may prove difficult, as patchy power availability, high electricity costs, and water scarcity pose <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-file-100-billion-data-centre-boom-tests-resource-limits-2025-12-03/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">key constraints</a> for energy-intensive AI workloads. Those challenges could slow construction and raise operating costs for cloud providers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The announcements on data centers signal that they are being treated as a strategic business sector rather than just back-end infrastructure,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner of New Delhi-based The Quantum Hub, a public policy and tech consulting firm. The push is likely to attract more private investment and strengthen India’s position as a regional data and compute hub, though execution challenges around power availability, land access, and state-level clearances remain, he added.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagar Vishnoi, co-founder and director of Noida-based think tank Future Shift Labs, said India’s data-center power capacity is projected to surpass 2 gigawatts by 2026, up from just over 1 gigawatt currently, and could expand more than fivefold to exceed 8 gigawatts by 2030, driven by capital investments of more than $30 billion. While the budget signals clear intent to accelerate digital infrastructure and cloud computing, Vishnoi said allowing foreign cloud firms to earn profits tax-free until 2047 reflects a “strategic bet on global Big Tech,” even as India could produce its own technology champions over the next two decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that routing services to Indian users through reseller entities could leave smaller domestic players competing for thin margins, rather than receiving comparable upstream incentives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The federal budget also stepped up incentives to deepen India’s role in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, as the country seeks to move beyond assembly and capture more value in global supply chains. The federal government would launch a second phase of the India Semiconductor Mission, the finance minister said, focused on producing equipment and materials, developing full-stack domestic chip intellectual property, and strengthening supply chains, while backing industry-led research and training centers to build a skilled workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the Indian government has raised the outlay for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme to ₹400 billion (around $4.36 billion), from ₹229.19 billion (about $2.50 billion), after the program — launched in April 2025 — attracted investment commitments at more than double its original target, Sitharaman said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This scheme offers incentives tied to incremental production and investment, reimbursing a portion of costs for companies that manufacture key components such as printed circuit boards, camera modules, connectors, and other parts used in smartphones, servers, and data-center hardware. By linking payouts to actual output rather than upfront subsidies, the program is designed to draw global suppliers deeper into India’s electronics supply chain and reduce reliance on imported components — a long-standing criticism of the country’s manufacturing push.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside increasing the spending allocation for the electronics components scheme, the federal budget also proposed a five-year tax exemption starting in April for foreign companies supplying equipment and tooling to electronics toll manufacturers operating in bonded zones. The change is likely to benefit companies including Apple, which relies heavily on contract manufacturing in India and has previously been reported to have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/apple-lobbies-india-change-tax-law-seen-hindering-its-expansion-sources-say-2025-10-15/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sought clarity from New Delhi</a> on the tax treatment of high-end iPhone production equipment supplied to its partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The budget also sought to address vulnerabilities in critical minerals, as India <a href=\"https://www.forbesindia.com/article/take-one-big-story-of-the-day/the-rare-earth-magnet-shortage-what-can-indian-automakers-do/96320/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">grapples</a> with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ny24j0r3o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tightening global supplies of rare earth materials</a> used in electric vehicles, electronics devices, and defense systems. The finance minister said the federal government would support mineral-rich states including Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu in establishing dedicated rare-earth corridors to promote mining, processing, research, and manufacturing. The move builds on a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-26/india-approves-815-million-rare-earth-plan-to-spur-local-output\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">seven-year incentive program</a> approved in late 2025 to boost domestic production of rare-earth magnets, as access to supplies from China — which dominates global output — has become more constrained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond AI infrastructure and electronics manufacturing, the Indian government also moved to boost cross-border e-commerce, aiming to help smaller businesses tap global demand. The finance minister said the existing ₹1 million (around $11,000) value cap per consignment on courier exports would be removed, a move expected to benefit small manufacturers, artisans, and startups selling overseas through online platforms. The federal government would streamline the handling of rejected and returned shipments using technology, addressing a long-standing bottleneck for exporters, Sitharaman said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, the latest measures emphasize India’s ambition to position itself as a long-term hub for global technology infrastructure, spanning cloud computing, electronics manufacturing, and critical minerals. The strategy aims to capitalize on surging AI demand and shifting supply chains. Nonetheless, its success will hinge on execution — from reliable power and water for data centers to sustained support for domestic innovation — as global companies and investors weigh whether India can translate policy incentives into durable leadership in the AI era.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Thirty years ago, we’d be talking about General Electric. Today, we’re talking about Elon Musk. He’s the CEO of Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX, which also owns the telecoms company Starlink. He owns the social media platform X. He’s developing neural implants and underground tunnels. He’s put at least $10 million behind <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/elon-musk-reportedly-donated-10-million-to-a-fertility-research-project/\">fertility research</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk also appears to be merging several of these ventures into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\">one conglomerate</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk has frequently been likened to Henry Ford. A more apt comparison might be to John D. Rockefeller or Jack Welch, who took GE from an ailing industrial company into a sprawling conglomerate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Welch comparison could turn out to be particularly valid if Musk follows through on rumors that he’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\">trying to merge some combination of SpaceX, xAI and Tesla</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The similarities aren’t all encompassing, of course. GE was a company, and Musk is a person. But the distinction can get a bit blurry in an era when his net worth eclipses the market cap of 97% of the S&amp;P 500. In fact, Musk’s net worth is approaching $800 billion, almost as much as GE at its peak when adjusted for inflation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its height, GE was often inseparable from its chairman, Jack Welch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk, the individual, captivates many of his peers, just like Welch did. Executives today talk of being “hardcore” and espouse “first-principles thinking,” just like CEOs of the 1980s sought to emulate Welch through “accretive” mergers and mass layoffs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Musk’s empire spans Tesla, SpaceX, xAI (including with X), Neuralink, and The Boring Company, all companies with very different goals. Sure, Teslas drive through The Boring Company’s holes, xAI’s Grok is available in the automaker’s vehicles, and Tesla has supplied its Megapack batteries to xAI’s data centers. But apart from sharing Musk’s ownership or leadership, they’ve had limited interaction with each other until recently, when Tesla and SpaceX <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/spacex-to-invest-2-billion-into-elon-musks-xai-413934de\">separately</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-invested-2b-in-elon-musks-xai/\">invested</a> in xAI.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-everything-company\">The everything company</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At one time, not so long ago, GE was the world’s most valuable company, with divisions that made light bulbs, jet engines, home appliances, X-ray and ultrasound machines, steam turbines, locomotives, and television shows, among dozens of others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Welch took the helm of GE in 1981, he inherited a company adrift, having <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/ges-split-unravels-massive-management-mistake\">lost a fifth of its market cap</a> in the preceding decade. His first move was to trim headcount. In fact, he laid off so many employees — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/01/1101505691/short-term-profits-and-long-term-consequences-did-jack-welch-break-capitalism\">more than 100,000</a> in his first few years — that he became known as “Neutron Jack,” an allusion to the neutron bomb, which eliminates people while leaving buildings intact.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the savings, Welch went out and acquired company after company. Many of them manufactured stuff, similar to GE’s existing businesses. But some, like NBC, which Welch bought in 1986, did not. That one was added to the portfolio to expand the company’s influence. (Sound familiar?)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his tenure as chairman of GE, Welch was revered for his management abilities, with rival CEOs emulating his management style. The company’s management training program was put on the same pedestal as top business schools, and several of his proteges went on to run Fortune 500 companies themselves. Through a relentless series of layoffs and acquisitions, Welch had turned GE into a money printing machine. The company grew from $14 billion when he took over to over $400 billion when he left in 2001. Shareholder dividends only went up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Welch’s approach wasn’t ironclad. In 2001, his last year at GE, the company’s share price declined. By the time the 2008 financial crisis hit, it was clear that the company’s conglomerate structure was hiding some grievous flaws. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Profits from GE Capital were used to paper over poor performance in other divisions. When it became clear that GE Capital was deep into questionable financial instruments, fractures in the business model widened. GE Capital was ultimately bailed out by the federal government to the tune of $139 billion, but the shine was off. Five years ago, GE announced that it would split itself into three separate companies. The conglomerate was no more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from Welch, Musk might have another comparison a bit farther back in history, before GE became the prototypical conglomerate. “I think it’s much more of a robber baron story than a GE conglomerate story,”<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6577\"> David Yoffie</a>, professor at Harvard Business School, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gilded-age-ceo\">Gilded Age CEO</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Gilded Age, he said, people like J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller controlled large, powerful companies that built new industries like railroads and oil companies. They controlled those firms either directly or through board seats they influenced, and they could mix and match companies as they pleased.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that’s much more the type of approach that Elon is taking,” Yoffie said. “It’s much more about ego, market power, and trying to be the kingmaker.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the robber barons’ power came from two sources: their tremendous wealth and the lack of regulation at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wealth disparities have grown similarly large in recent years. John D. Rockefeller’s wealth was equal to a percentage point or two of the United States’ total GDP, about the same as Musk’s today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What’s different, of course, is that there was no regulatory framework whatsoever during the period of the Gilded Age,” Yoffie said. “Today, we obviously live in a much more heavily regulated world, but we’re also at the moment living in a world in which regulation is getting pulled back and therefore is less and less of a constraint.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What ultimately happens to Musk and his empire will depend both on the direction he decides to take things — to merge his companies or keep them separate — and how society responds to his growing power. Musk, like his Gilded Age predecessors, has been attempting to put his thumb on the scales, spending more than $300 million trying to influence <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions\">elections</a> in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/05/12/record-100m-spent-on-wisconsin-supreme-court-race-raises-concerns-over-judicial-independence/\">U.S.</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/musk-rallies-far-right-europe-tesla-is-paying-price-2025-03-04/\">abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Musk ends up merging one or more of his companies, he’ll end up with a true conglomerate, something that’s not in vogue today. Conglomerates in the U.S. emerged as a way for investors to hedge risk by buying shares in one company that has businesses that are counter-cyclical, Yoffie said. If one division hits a rough patch, others can pick up the slack to keep revenue and profit smooth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of that strategy and approach was debunked in subsequent decades,” he said. Investors tend to do better when they buy shares in more specialized companies, which are able to operate more efficiently. Conglomerates also make it difficult to disentangle the different businesses to accurately determine their value. “It’s well known in finance that there’s a conglomerate discount,” Yoffie said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merger talk aside, the biggest constraint on Musk’s companies might be regulation, which is ultimately driven by public opinion. The tycoons of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries found their power ultimately checked by a wave of new regulations introduced in the Progressive Era. Musk has a knack for embracing visions of the future that captivate people’s imaginations and translating them into business plans. The question is, how long will he be able to keep it up?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Until <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/founders-and-vcs-back-a-pan-european-c-corp-but-an-eu-inc-has-a-rocky-road-ahead/\">a pan-European corporate structure</a> exists (often called “EU Inc”), this split will remain common — and we’ve decided to overlook it. Take <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/vibe-coding-startup-lovable-raises-330m-at-a-6-6b-valuation/\">Lovable</a>, which is incorporated in Delaware but cannot be dissociated from Stockholm’s startup scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Second: valuation doesn’t equal commercial success, and it is too early to tell whether all of these companies will achieve the kind of traction that Lovable has, with the company recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/SebJohnsonUK/status/2017339797644153021\">crossing $300 million in annual recurring revenue</a>. But in the current climate, the fact that VCs were willing to invest in them at unicorn valuations is a strong signal of where the appetite is. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With these caveats out of the way, let’s dive in.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-aikido-nbsp\">Aikido </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Belgium-based cybersecurity startup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aikido.dev/\">Aikido Security</a> reached unicorn status with its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/14/3218567/0/en/Aikido-Security-Raises-60-Million-Series-B-at-1-Billion-Valuation-to-Lead-Software-Security.html\">$60 million Series B</a> funding round.

So Tobaccowala turned to something she knew well: surveys. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given my love of surveys, I surveyed a ton — a ton — of customers,” said Tobaccowala, who used to be president and CTO of SurveyMonkey. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What she found was that people were struggling to figure out how to lower their utility bills. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we talked to consumers, we heard the same thing over and over again: They get that email that says, ‘Hey, you spend more money than your neighbors,’” she said. “They were sort of stuck with what to do about it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tobaccowala co-founded <a href=\"https://www.homeboost.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">HomeBoost</a> to help people conduct their own home energy assessments.

As people walk around their homes, the infrared camera shows them where cold (or hot) air is seeping into their homes; the blacklight tells people which lights could be upgraded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using data from the scans, the app then automatically generates a report that suggests the most cost-effective upgrades, including rebates based on where the person lives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many parts of the country, utilities offer a similar service. Utilities, which are incentivized to reduce end users’ energy use, often work with energy auditors to survey people’s homes to identify ways to trim their consumption. But the quality of those services can be very uneven, Tobaccowala said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We talked to a bunch of consumers who’d gotten home energy assessments done, and there this feeling that was like ‘all they did was try to sell me up an upgraded HVAC,’” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The HomeBoost app is cheaper and faster than an auditor, and it helps people feel more in control of the process, Tobaccowala said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HomeBoost charges customers $99, which is about a quarter the cost of a traditional, in-person assessment. It is also working with utilities, which cover some or all of the cost for customers. The startup has signed deals with Central Hudson, Omaha Public Power District, and more recently Avista. Omaha Power, for example, pays for all but $19 of the cost, while Central Hudson will cover the entire cost if homeowners check out the BoostBox from a public library.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But not every homeowner wants to complete the survey process themselves, and not every auditor is a pushy salesperson. Dedicated auditors can spend between two and 10 hours surveying homes, collating data, and building reports, Tobaccowala said. For that, HomeBoost has developed a version of its app for professionals, allowing them to serve more customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also testing a feature that will link homeowners with contractors who can follow through on the upgrades outlined in the report. For contractors, it’s another source of new business, and it allows them to get information on a project before even setting foot inside a home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing consumers, utilities, and contractors together, Tobaccowala hopes that HomeBoost can ultimately deliver on the climate front, too. “It’s a very unique situation where everybody’s aligned to actually lower the utility bill, which in the net result is improvement on the climate,” she said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This comes months after the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/a16z-pauses-its-famed-txo-fund-for-underserved-founders-lays-off-staff/?_thumbnail_id=3064752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">firm paused TxO and laid off most of its staff</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work,” Ampadu wrote in the email, sent Friday afternoon, with the subject line “Closing My a16z Chapter.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ampadu led the program, which launched in 2020, for over four years until its pause last November, taking over for the initial leader, Nait Jones. Afterward, Ampadu <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/kofi-ampadu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">seems to have worked at a16z’s</a> latest accelerator, Speedrun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ampadu’s departure perhaps signals the end of the TxO chapter. The fund and program focused on supporting underserved founders by providing access to tech networks and investment capital through a donor-advised fund. Though some founders spoke highly of the program, others criticized the controversial donor-advised structure. The program also launched a grant program in 2024 to provide $50,000 to nonprofits that help diverse founders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its last cohort was in March 2025, and its indefinite pause came as many top tech names reframe, cut, or eliminate prior public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We’ve reached out to a16z and Ampadu for comment. <br><br>His full note below:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I moved to the United States three months before my 11th birthday.

Even at 10 years old, I knew it made no sense that a kid from Ghana, an English-speaking country, was being asked to learn a language he already spoke fluently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was a systems requirement, a blanketed assumption about what students from certain places could or could not do. That same type of systemic assumption is what we set out to challenge through the Talent x Opportunity Initiative. The venture ecosystem often relies on proxies such as schools, networks, and prior credentials, which can obscure exceptional founders who do not follow the most common paths. TxO invested in and supported these overlooked founders to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work. Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As I move on to my next chapter, I leave with pride in what we built and gratitude for everyone who helped shape it. Thank you for the trust, the collaboration, and the belief in what is possible. There is more work to do and I am excited to keep building.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
