They’re not designed to manage the messier work of real collaboration: coordinating people with competing priorities, tracking long-running decisions, and keeping teams aligned over time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp;, a new startup founded by alumni of Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, thinks closing that gap is the next major frontier for foundation models. The company this week raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/humans-a-human-centric-ai-startup-founded-by-anthropic-xai-google-alums-raised-480m-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a $480 million seed round</a> to build a “central nervous system” for the human-plus-AI economy. The startup’s “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/humans-ai-anthropic-xai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI for empowering humans</a>” framing has dominated early coverage, but the company’s actual ambition is more novel: building a new foundation model architecture designed for social intelligence, not just information retrieval or code generation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It feels like we’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals, and now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things,” Andi Peng, one of humans&amp;’s co-founders and a former Anthropic employee, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp;’s pitch centers on helping usher people into the new era of AI, moving beyond the narrative that AI will take their jobs. Whether or not that’s just marketing speak, the timing is critical: Companies are transitioning from chat to agents. Models are competent, but workflows aren’t, and the coordination challenge remains largely unaddressed. And through it all, people feel threatened and overwhelmed by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The three-month-old company, like several of its peers, has managed to raise its startling seed round off the back of this philosophy and the pedigree of its founding team. Humans&amp; still doesn’t have a product, nor has it been clear about what exactly it might be, though the team said it could be a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (think <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/slackbot-is-an-ai-agent-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slack</a>) or collaboration platforms (think Google Docs and Notion). As for use cases and target audience, the team hinted at both enterprise and consumer applications. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are building a product and a model that is centered on communication and collaboration,” Eric Zelikman, co-founder and CEO of humans&amp; and former xAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the focus is on getting the product to help people work together and communicate more effectively — both with each other and with AI tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like,” Zelikman continued, chortling with his team as they recalled the time-consuming tedium of getting everyone to agree on a logo for the startup. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zelikman added that the new model will be trained to ask questions in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you. Chatbots today are programmed to ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question. He says this is because they’ve been optimized for two things: How much a user immediately likes a response they’re given, and how likely the model is to answer the question it receives correctly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the lack of clarity around what the product is could be that humans&amp; doesn’t exactly have an answer for that yet. Peng said humans&amp; is designing the product in conjunction with the model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense,” she said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What is clear, though, is that humans&amp; isn’t trying to make a new model that can plug into existing applications and collaboration tools. The startup wants to own the collaboration layer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI plus team collaboration and productivity tools are an increasingly hot field — for example, the startup AI note-taking app Granola raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$43 million round</a> at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman today argued that companies are implementing AI wrong by treating it like isolated pilots and that the real leverage is in the coordination layer of work — that is, how teams share knowledge and run meetings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is,” Hoffman <a href=\"https://x.com/reidhoffman/status/2014028797507449206?s=61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote on social media</a>. “They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the space where humans&amp; wants to live. The idea is that its model-slash-product would act as the “connective tissue” across any organization — be it a 10,000-person business or a family — that understands the skills, motivations, and needs of each person, as well as how all of those can be balanced for the good of the whole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get there requires rethinking how AI models are trained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a humans&amp; co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent academic work</a> as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The model needs to remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding,” He said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the stellar crew running the show, there are plenty of risks ahead. Humans&amp; will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model. That means it will be competing with the major established players for resources, including access to compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The top risk, though, is that humans&amp; isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives humans&amp; a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&amp;A is certainly a risk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp; told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This post was original published on January 22, 2026.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Works written entirely by large language models would not be eligible, while authors who used LLMs “at any point during the writing process” had to disclose that use, allowing award voters to make their own decisions about whether that usage would affect their support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Jason Sanford reported in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://jasonsanford.substack.com/p/sfwa-changes-nebula-award-rules-to\">his Genre Grapevine newsletter</a>, this change drew immediate backlash for seemingly opening the door to work partly created by LLMs. SFWA’s Board of Directors <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sfwa.org/2025/12/19/press-release-december-19-2025/\">issued an apology a few days later</a>, writing, “Our approach and wording was wrong and we apologize for the distress and distrust we caused.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rules were revised yet again, now stating that works that are “written, either wholly or partially, by generative large language model (LLM) tools are not eligible” for Nebula Awards and that work will be disqualified if LLMs were used at any point in its creation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://jasonsanford.substack.com/p/thoughts-on-the-nebula-awards-llm\">a follow-up post</a>, Sanford said he was pleased to see SFWA listen to its members, and he said he refuses to use gen AI in his own fiction writing — “not only because of this theft but also because the tools are not actually creative and defeat the entire point of storytelling.” Still, he wrote that important questions need to be answered about how broadly LLM usage will be defined, especially as “these generative AI products are being forced down everyone’s throats by major corporations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you use any online search engines or computer products these days, it’s likely you’re using something powered by or connected with an LLM,” Sanford said. “Because of that, we must be careful that writers who use word processing and research tools with LLM components aren’t unfairly disqualified from awards like the Nebulas or attacked by readers and other writers. “</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The massive annual San Diego Comic-Con faced a similar controversy this month after artists noticed rules allowing AI-generated art to be displayed — but not sold — at the convention’s art show. After artists complained, the rules were <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.comicsbeat.com/sdcc-changes-art-show-policy-bans-ai-created-material/\">quietly changed to say</a>, “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Comic-Con’s apology was less public than SFWA, some artists shared emailed responses from art show head Glen Wooten, who apparently said the previous rules had been in place for “a few years” and that they’d been effective as a deterrent, since no one had entered AI-generated art in the show.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But the issue is becoming more of a problem, so more strident language is necessary: NO! Plain and simple,” Wooten reportedly said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s probably safe to that assume other organizations will be announcing similarly hard-line stances this year — and that these communities will continue debating the larger issues. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But, hold up, there is more to it than mere optics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The week started with Tesla offering passengers robotaxi rides in Austin <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/tesla-launches-robotaxi-rides-in-austin-with-no-human-safety-driver/\">without a human safety driver </a>in the front seat. If you recall, Tesla launched a limited service in Austin last year with a fleet of modified Tesla Model Y vehicles running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software known as Full Self-Driving Supervised (this one being “unsupervised”). Human safety operators have been riding in the front passenger seat as a precaution since the rollout.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not all of Tesla’s fleet in Austin will be fully driverless, and there is apparently a chase vehicle behind those that are. Still, it is notable and suggests Tesla is moving toward a broader ramp-up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tesla-discontinues-autopilot-in-bid-to-boost-adoption-of-its-full-self-driving-software/\">Tesla has killed Autopilot</a>, the advanced driver-assistance system that was initially introduced to its vehicles in 2014. Autopilot has gone through several software and hardware iterations over the years with new capabilities. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autopilot was instantly popular and controversial, in part because the name implied the system was more capable than it actually was. (Drivers are responsible and are supposed to have their hands on the wheel when Autopilot is engaged.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla eventually made a basic Autopilot system standard in all of its vehicles, while launching and charging for a more robust system known now as Full Self-Driving (Supervised). The basic version, which is now dead, included traffic-aware cruise control, in which the vehicle maintains a set distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a feature that centers the vehicle in the lane and steers it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its decision to kill what was standard ADAS comes one week after Tesla said it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software and move all customers to a monthly subscription. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These decisions when taken together offer a simple enough explanation: Tesla wants to recognize more revenue from FSD as it positions itself as an AI and robotics company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there is another possible reason. The company is facing a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in California after a judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-marketing-for-autopilot-and-full-self-driving-judge-rules/\">deceptive marketing</a> by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ruling has been stayed for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply. Dropping the Autopilot name while cashing in on FSD is a rather bold move. But perhaps Tesla believes this is enough to satiate the DMV.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-deals\">Deals!</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?w=680\" alt=\"money the station\" class=\"wp-image-1896226\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=430,108 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=720,180 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=900,225 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=800,200 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=668,167 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=708,177 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Zipline</strong>, the autonomous drone-delivery and logistics startup, has been around for more than a decade, starting in Rwanda delivering blood.

Staffers posting on various social media sites that the layoffs impacted most of the company, including the entire video team. Vimeo is a video-hosting platform, so that sounds bad.<br><br>The layoffs are the latest restructuring by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bendingspoons.com/\">Bending Spoons</a>, the Milan-based tech conglomerate that acquired Vimeo for $1.38 billion in an all-cash deal that closed in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mlq.ai/news/bending-spoons-completes-138-billion-acquisition-of-vimeo-delisting-company-from-nasdaq/\">latter half of 2025</a>. While Bending Spoons may be unknown to many, it’s quietly become one of the tech industry’s most prolific buyers, now owning Meetup, WeTransfer, Eventbrite, and many others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So what exactly is Bending Spoons? Despite its catchy name, the 12-year-old company has stayed remarkably under the radar, typically making headlines only when it adds another recognizable brand to its portfolio — or when it restructures these companies through significant layoffs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s playbook has become clear: acquire underperforming but popular tech brands, then transform them to serve millions of users more efficiently through controversial changes to beloved products and substantial workforce reductions. It followed this pattern with Evernote and WeTransfer, and is now repeating it with Vimeo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite remaining largely unknown to the public, Bending Spoons’ roster of products has served more than a billion people, with over 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers. Here’s what you need to know about the company reshaping some of the internet’s most recognizable brands.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-bending-spoons\">What is Bending Spoons?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite often being described as a private equity firm, Bending Spoons describes itself more specifically as a company that acquires and transforms digital businesses. Having grown to a headcount of 400 to 500 employees (whom the company calls “Spooners”), its main focus is on making improvements to products and services that others have created.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it didn’t start that way — Bending Spoons’ founders had taken a stab at building their own apps and products before eventually shifting their focus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The little-known backstory is that Bending Spoons was born out of the remains of Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2011/startup-alley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">participated in Disrupt SF 2011’s Startup Alley</a> and raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/24/evertale-a-social-network-for-the-less-proactive-gets-seed-funding-from-mangrove/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">seed funding</a> for its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/so-its-like-color-evertale-pivots-launches-real-time-photo-sharing-app-wink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">photo-sharing app</a>, Wink. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Evertale failed not long after, and investors were able to exit, but its founders and a couple of employees kept working together, initially on in-house apps. Soon enough, the team made its first acquisition, followed by many others, CEO and co-founder Luca Ferrari told the venture podcast 20VC <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJyHmyjG204\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a rare interview.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2020, Bending Spoons made an exception when it created and donated Immuni, Italy’s official COVID-19 contact-tracing app. But other than that, it has mostly been honing a formula: Bending Spoons identifies a popular product it thinks it can improve inside and out, and buys it from owners who have reached their limits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the acquisition, Bending Spoons is anything but a passive owner, making changes to the products’ user experience and features, as well as to the underlying tech; monetization strategy, including pricing; and team organization, including headcount.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this focus on efficiency and revenue overlaps with private equity strategies, Bending Spoons claims a key difference: It “aims to hold forever, and has never sold an acquired business.” It is building a live portfolio, not collecting internet relics or presiding over a tech graveyard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, Bending Spoons’ acquisition targets so far haven’t necessarily been failing businesses — many still had substantial user bases and revenue. But they’ve tended to be stagnant, neglected, or had owners looking to exit. Let’s recap these key deals, and what happened in their aftermath.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-companies-has-bending-spoons-acquired\">What companies has Bending Spoons acquired?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bending Spoons acquired several companies between 2014 and 2021, including the AI-powered photo enhancer Remini, its most notable acquisitions happened more recently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, it acquired Filmic, known for its popular video- and photo-editing apps, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/bending-spoons-lays-off-entire-staff-of-flimic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">laid off the entire staff</a> in December 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a deal also announced in 2022 and finalized in early 2023, Bending Spoons also acquired Evernote, the note-taking app that had reportedly reached a $1 billion valuation before hitting trouble. Layoffs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/bending-spoons-lays-off-129-evernote-staffers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">followed the acquisition</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/its-official-evernote-will-restrict-free-users-to-50-notes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cuts to Evernote’s free offering</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first half of following year, 2024, was particularly active, with the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240124551711/en/Bending-Spoons-finalizes-acquisition-of-U.S.-based-community-building-platform-Meetup-and-announces-%2450000-Community-Fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquisition of Meetup</a>, app maker <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240110239723/en/Bending-Spoons-Acquires-Mosaic-Group-Digital-Assets-From-IAC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mosaic Group</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.northstarmeetingsgroup.com/Planning-Tips-and-Trends/Event-Planning/Event-Technology/Hopin-StreamYard-to-be-acquired-by-Bending-Spoons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hopin’s StreamYard</a> all happening within six months. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July 2024, it went on to acquire the publishing platform <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240719725742/en/Digital-Publishing-Platform-Issuu-Acquired-by-Bending-Spoons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Issuu</a> and the file transfer service <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bending-spoons-acquires-file-transfer-service-wetransfer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WeTransfer</a>, where it later <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/bending-spoons-plans-to-lay-off-75-of-wetransfer-staff-after-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cut staff</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/wetransfers-free-plan-now-has-a-monthly-limit-of-10-transfers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">made changes to its free plan</a>, introducing stricter limits. In December 2025, WeTransfer’s cofounder Nalden criticized Bending Spoons’ decisions and said he was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/28/why-wetransfer-co-founder-is-building-another-file-transfer-service/\">building another file transfer service</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November 2024, Bending Spoons announced it would spend <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/bending-spoons-is-taking-video-platform-brightcove-private-in-233m-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$233 million</a> on an all-cash take-private deal to acquire video platform Brightcove. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisitions have continued apace in 2025, with acquisitions that include the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250320568940/en/Bending-Spoons-Acquires-komoot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">route planner Komoot</a> and management software maker <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/225798-22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Harvest</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bending Spoons also announced its intention to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/vimeo-to-be-acquired-by-bending-spoons-in-1-38b-all-cash-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquire Vimeo</a> in a $1.38 billion all-cash deal, and soon after, to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/bending-spoons-to-acquire-aol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquire AOL</a> from Yahoo for an undisclosed amount. (Disclosure: Both AOL and Yahoo are former owners of TechCrunch, in which Yahoo retains a small interest.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, Bending Spoons said the acquisitions of AOL and Vimeo were expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals; including, in the case of Vimeo, approval by its stockholders, which they have recently granted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Vimeo acquisition closed in the latter half of 2025, and was followed by the massive layoffs that hit the company this month, impacting most of the workforce including the entire video team.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2025, Bending Spoons announced it would acquire yet another well-known brand: Eventbrite. Once again, it may pay much less than Eventbrite was once worth — only some $500 million, a far cry from the company’s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/eventbrite-valued-at-1-76-billion-in-ipo-1537443074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$1.76 billion</a> valuation when it went public in 2018.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there might be more hurdles. Earlier this month, Eventbrite stockholders <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.law360.com/articles/2429237/eventbrite-stockholders-sue-to-block-500m-take-private-deal\">filed a lawsuit in Delaware</a> to upend the take-private deal over voting rights, and Eventbrite is currently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/this-week-in-chancery-court-hudl-ruling-eventbrite-sale-foley\">fighting an effort</a> to fast-track this challenge.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-much-is-bending-spoons-worth\">How much is Bending Spoons worth?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since October 2025, Bending Spoons has been one of Europe’s rare tech decacorns (companies valued at more than $10 billion). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This comes on the heels of Bending Spoons’ latest funding round: $270 million from investors, including T. Rowe Price and earlier backers Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, Durable Capital Partners, and Fidelity, plus a $440 million secondary share sale by existing shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company last raised at a $2.8 billion valuation in 2024, making its updated $11 billion valuation a significant step up — also for its four co-founders, who joined the billionaire ranks as a result.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ferrari’s stake in Bending Spoons is now reportedly worth $1.4 billion, while co-founders Matteo Danieli, Luca Querella, and Francesco Patarnello each hold stakes worth $1.3 billion, according to Forbes estimates based on shareholder data published by the Italian Business Register.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear whether any of the co-founders sold stock in the secondary transaction. Bending Spoons has declined to comment on its co-founders’ stakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though long bootstrapped, Bending Spoons had previously raised equity financing <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bending-spoons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">several times</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220927005732/en/Bending-Spoons-Raises-%24340-Million-in-Financing-as-Global-Demand-for-Mobile-First-Creator-Tools-Soars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in September 2022</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/evernote-and-meetup-owner-bending-spoons-raises-155m-in-equity-financing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">early 2024</a>. It also has VIPs on its cap table, including tennis and entertainment stars Andre Agassi and Bradley Cooper; tech industry bigs Eric Schmidt, Mike Krieger, and Xavier Niel; and performers The Weeknd, The Chainsmokers, and Maluma.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upon announcing its new funding in October 2025, Bending Spoons said it would support future acquisitions and investment in its proprietary technology and AI capabilities. This comes in addition to the $2.8 billion in debt financing the company disclosed when it announced its intention to acquire AOL, debt that will fund the AOL deal and future acquisitions.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bending Spoons said it intends to continue pursuing new acquisitions that expand its portfolio of consumer and enterprise digital products, and it now has funding to afford more prominent targets going forward — as confirmed by its decision to acquire Eventbrite.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AOL and Vimeo already carry far more name recognition than earlier targets, though the AOL terms remain undisclosed. The properties also have some reach. In announcing the AOL deal, Bending Spoons claimed that AOL remains one of the top 10 most-used email providers in the world, with 8 million daily active users and 30 million monthly active users. (Not long before acquiring AOL, Bending Spoons was also <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-11/bending-spoons-looks-to-buy-typeform-elysium-messaggero-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rumored</a> to be eyeing <a href=\"https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/bending_spoons_4_colpi_da_3_miliardi_di_dollari-9119455.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">app maker Elysium</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/typeform-series-c/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Typeform</a>, the Barcelona-based SaaS company known for its form creation tools.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Presumably to support its continued efforts to acquire companies, it also has openings across various roles, with new hires initially working from its Milan headquarters before gaining the option to work from offices in London, Madrid, and Warsaw, or remotely. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, despite warning candidates that Bending Spoons is a “demanding environment,” the company has said it already received more than 600,000 job applications in 2025, a figure that will likely climb as its recent deals generate additional attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candidates aside, Bending Spoons is also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ifre.com/equities/2370016/bending-spoons-interviews-banks-for-us-ipo\">interviewing banks</a>. According to reports, the company is holding talks with several financial entities to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bebeez.eu/2026/01/19/italys-private-equity-weekly-roundup-news-from-bending-spoon-digited-nextalia-safetec-halma-and-more/\">launch an IPO on the NYSE</a>.

Amidst all that big-picture prognostication, they also found time to take swipes at their competitors, and even at their ostensible partners.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the latest episode of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/\">TechCrunch’s Equity podcast</a>, I discussed all things Davos with TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec and Sean O’Kane.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kirsten noted that the conference seemed transformed from past years, with tech companies like Meta and Salesforce taking over the main promenade, while important topics like climate change failed to draw crowds. And Sean said that even if AI execs weren’t <em>quite</em> “panhandling for usage and more customers,” it could sometimes feel that way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Read a preview of our full conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirsten:</strong> Some of the discussions around, let’s say, climate change or poverty and big global problems, [are] not really attracting the crowds. Meanwhile, on the main promenade in Davos, Switzerland, some of the biggest storefronts have been converted and taken over by companies like Meta and Salesforce, Tata, also a lot of Middle East countries. And I think the largest was the USA House, which was sponsored by McKinsey and Microsoft. It really felt visually different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then Elon Musk being there — Sean, you and I both listened to it. There wasn’t a lot of there there, but I will say that it was interesting that he showed up, because in the past he has avoided Davos.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthony:</strong> We were trying to pull out the tech content of Davos, [and] there are absolutely things that worth highlighting here, but it’s also striking how, especially as AI has become such a big business story, it’s hard to fully separate that from all the other threads going on in terms of bigger questions about international trade, about world politics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the big headlines coming out of [Davos], for us at least, was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/anthropics-ceo-stuns-davos-with-nvidia-criticism/\">the remarks by the CEO of Anthropic</a>, where he basically attacked this Trump administration decision to allow Nvidia to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/us-approves-nvidia-h200-chip-exports-china-conditions-rcna253948\">send chips to China</a>. It’s a story that is a tech story, but it’s also a trade story, it’s a politics story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think in terms of the substance of what he said, it felt consistent to me in the sense that he’s generally comfortable shooting his mouth off, and also that it’s this interesting line [in AI discourse] where there’s an element of criticism, but it also ties into this really intense AI hype. One of the phrases he used was that an AI data center is like a country full of geniuses. I have questions about that — but he’s like, “How could we possibly send all these chips to China if we’re worried about China? Because essentially we’re sending a country full of geniuses over to China and letting them control it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Sean:</strong> You could probably fill a notebook with all the different weird phrases that these CEOs use this week. The other one that has been stuck in my mind is that Satya Nadella kept calling the data centers token factories, which is a wonderful abstraction of what he thinks they’re there for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You know, there were two things that really stuck out to me about all the different things that were said by these CEOs in different parts of the week. One is that they are definitely all sort of sniping at each other — not just Anthropic with Nvidia, which is interesting in its own right, because Anthropic is a huge Nvidia customer and uses Nvidia GPUs, and there’s an interesting tension there. But also just seeing them sitting them next to each other and really kind of pulling, know, putting the knives out a little bit more than we’re used to seeing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We know that they’re all jockeying to be the lead and that they’re also trying to hold on to talent without overspending themselves to death. And this was one of the first times where it really felt like that tension was palpable and that they were present for it. Those two things are not often true at the same time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other thing, to your point about a lot of the geopolitics of it and the business of it — this was the most blatant that I feel like we’ve gotten these CEOs on record as far as what they think they need to continue succeeding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Satya Nadella — I think you could maybe unfavorably read it this way, but I don’t think it’s that unfavorable — more or less was like, “More people need to be using this or else it’s going to be a bubble and a popped bubble.” He took a much different position in some ways from Dario Amadei of Anthropic, because Nadella’s focus is really about trying to broadly scoop up as much usage as possible [and] how do we make sure that AI is equitable across all these different communities and throughout the globe, versus concentrated in one place, like only the wealthy places, which I thought was an interesting tension. But there is an element of him giving away the game of not <em>really</em> panhandling for usage and more customers … but kind of.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And to that point, Jensen Huang of Nvidia did something similar, where he was more or less saying, “We’re not investing enough in this and we need more investment to be able to make this work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirsten:</strong> Jensen’s comments were interesting because he really talked about it in terms of job creation, and one could give the counterpoint of, there will be a moment where the build out slows, but no one’s really talking about that right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other thing, I think, was a good point that you made, which is we’ve never really seen them all sort of together in a room sniping at each other. Oftentimes you’ll have like Sam Altman at a conference or Satya [Nadella], but here they are all together. So you’re hearing it in real time.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How did Davos turn into a tech conference? | Equity Podcast\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQZWR7hqcDA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Poojary later went on to work at Google and YouTube on shopping. Marchand, who is the CTO of Sparkli, was also one of the co-founders of Shoploop and later worked at Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When a kid asked what Mars looks like fifty years ago, we might have shown them a picture,” said Poojary. “Ten years ago, we might have shown them a video. With Sparkli, we want kids to interact and experience what Mars is like.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup said that education systems often fall behind in teaching modern concepts. Sparkli wants to teach kids about topics like skills design, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship by creating an AI-powered learning “expedition.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app lets users explore some predefined topics in different categories or ask their own questions to create a learning path. The app also highlights one new topic every day to let kids learn something new. Kids can either listen to the generated voice or read the text. Chapters under one topic include a mix of audio, video, images, quizzes, and games. The app also creates choose-as-you-go adventures that don’t create the pressure of getting questions right or wrong.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084427\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg 2763w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=1200,857 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=1280,914 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=430,307 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=720,514 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=900,643 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=800,572 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=1536,1097 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=2048,1463 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=668,477 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=525,375 525w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=864,617 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=708,506 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Simulator.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sparkli</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poojary mentioned that the startup uses generative AI to create all of its media assets on the fly. The company can create a learning experience within two minutes of a user asking a question, and it is trying to reduce this time further. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup mentioned that while AI assistants can help children learn certain topics, their focus is not on education. It said that to make its product effective, the first two hires were a PhD holder in educational science and AI and a teacher. This was a conscious decision to ensure its content better serves children, keeping principles of pedagogy in mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the key concerns around kids using AI is safety. Companies like OpenAI and Character.ai are facing lawsuits from parents who allege that these tools encouraged their children to self-harm. Sparkli said that while certain topics like sexual content are completely banned on the app, when a child asks about topics like self-harm, the app tries to teach them about emotional intelligence and encourages them to talk to their parents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is piloting its app with an institute that has a network of schools with over 100,000 students. Currently, its target audience is children aged 5-12, and it tested its product in over 20 schools last year.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sparkli - Hello World!\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5i6lPL0yOA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sparkli has also built a teacher module that allows teachers to track progress and assign homework to kids. The company said that it was inspired by Duolingo to make the app engaging enough that kids can learn concepts and also feel like coming back to the app frequently. The app has streaks and rewards for kids for completing lessons regularly. It also gives kids quest cards, based on the initial avatar they have set up, for learning different topics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have seen a very positive response from our school pilots. Teachers often use Sparkli to create expeditions that kids can explore at the start of the class and lead them into a more discussion-based format. Some teachers also used it to create [homework] after they explain a topic to let kids explore further and get a measure of their understanding,” Poojary said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the startup wants to primarily work with schools globally for the next few months, it wants to open up consumer access and let parents download the app by mid-2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised $5 million in pre-seed funding led by Swiss venture firm Founderful. Sparkli is Founderful’s first pure-play edtech investment. The firm’s founding partner, Lukas Weder, said that the team’s technical skill and market opportunity nudged him to invest in the startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a father of two kids who are in school now, I see them learning interesting stuff, but they don’t learn topics like financial literacy or innovation in technology. I thought from a product point of view, Sparkli gets them away from video games and lets them learn stuff in an immersive way,” Weder said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This post was first published on January 22, 2026.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

You also have legendary researchers with immense experience but ambiguous commercial aspirations. There’s a clear chance that at least some of these new labs will become OpenAI-sized behemoths, but there’s also room for them to putter around doing interesting research without worrying too much about commercialization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end result? It’s getting hard to tell who is actually trying to make money. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To make things simpler, I’m proposing a kind of sliding scale for any company making a foundation model. It’s a five-level scale where it doesn’t matter if you’re actually making money – only if you’re trying to. The idea here is to measure ambition, not success. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Think of it in these terms: </p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><strong>Level 5</strong>: We are already making millions of dollars every day, thank you very much. </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><strong>Level 4: </strong>We have a detailed multi-stage plan to become the richest human beings on Earth. </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><strong>Level 3: </strong>We have many promising product ideas, which will be revealed in the fullness of time. </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><strong>Level 2: </strong>We have the outlines of a concept of a plan<strong>.</strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><strong>Level 1: </strong>True wealth is when you love yourself. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The big names are all at Level 5: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and so on. The scale gets more interesting with the new generation of labs launching now, with big dreams but ambitions that can be harder to read. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, the people involved in these labs can generally choose whatever level they want. There’s so much money in AI right now that no one is going to interrogate them for a business plan. Even if the lab is just a research project, investors will count themselves happy to be involved. If you aren’t particularly motivated to become a billionaire, you might well live a happier life at Level 2 than at Level 5. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problems arise because it isn’t always clear where an AI lab lands on the scale — and a lot of the AI industry’s current drama comes from that confusion. Much of the anxiety over OpenAI’s conversion from a non-profit came because the lab spent years at Level 1, then jumped to Level 5 almost overnight. On the other side, you might argue that Meta’s early AI research was firmly at Level 2, when what the company really wanted was Level 4. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that in mind, here’s a quick rundown of four of the biggest contemporary AI labs, and how they measure up on the scale. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-humans-amp-nbsp\"><strong>Humans&amp;</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp; was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/humans-a-human-centric-ai-startup-founded-by-anthropic-xai-google-alums-raised-480m-seed-round/\">the big AI news this week</a>, and part of the inspiration for coming up with this whole scale. The founders have a compelling pitch for the next generation of AI models, with scaling laws giving way to an emphasis on communication and coordination tools.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But for all the glowing press, Humans&amp; has been coy about how that would translate into actual monetizable products. It seems it <em>does</em> want to build products; the team just won’t commit to anything specific. The most they’ve said is that they will be building <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/humans-thinks-coordination-is-the-next-frontier-for-ai-and-theyre-building-a-model-to-prove-it/\">some kind of AI workplace tool,</a> replacing products like Slack, Jira and Google Docs but also redefining how these other tools work at a fundamental level. Workplace software for a post-software workplace! </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s my job to know what this stuff means, and I’m still pretty confused about that last part. But it is just specific enough that I think we can put them at Level 3. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-thinking-machines-lab-nbsp\"><strong>Thinking Machines Lab</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a very hard one to rate! Generally, if you have a former CTO and project lead for ChatGPT raising a $2 billion seed round, you have to assume there is a pretty specific roadmap. Mira Murati does not strike me as someone who jumps in without a plan, so coming into 2026, I would have felt good putting TML at Level 4. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/mira-muratis-startup-thinking-machines-lab-is-losing-two-of-its-co-founders-to-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the last two weeks happened</a>. The departure of CTO and co-founder Barret Zoph has gotten most of the headlines, due in part to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-messy-human-drama-that-dealt-a-blow-to-one-of-ais-hottest-startups-b86d736a?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcWdyEpd4Rd22WpI1cyE7Q2YwerX6O0aXmJdfADg3uKmpSh3OHK2kOaqlOGfN8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69739d8b&amp;gaa_sig=Ae8VbLlFSbQVYUmfNiLsHTDMb-ri_IYtj0hjdZUeHIHL3UwENGF5ojb0ase5tnLif33idQtqm-SaljvY7p6xiQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the special circumstances</a> involved. But at least five other employees left with Zoph, many citing concerns about the direction of the company. Just one year in, nearly half the executives on TML’s founding team are no longer working there. One way to read events is that they thought they had a solid plan to become a world-class AI lab, only to find the plan wasn’t as solid as they thought. Or in terms of the scale, they wanted a Level 4 lab but realized they were at Level 2 or 3. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There still isn’t quite enough evidence to justify a downgrade, but it’s getting close. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-world-labs-nbsp\"><strong>World Labs</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fei-Fei Li is one of the most respected names in AI research, best known for establishing the ImageNet challenge that kickstarted contemporary deep learning techniques. She currently holds a Sequoia-endowed chair at Stanford, where she co-directs two different AI labs. I won’t bore you by going through all the different honors and academy positions, but it’s enough to say that if she wanted, she could spend the rest of her life just receiving awards and being told how great she is. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-See-Curiosity-Exploration-Discovery-ebook/dp/B0BPQSLVL6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Her book</a> is pretty good too! </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-comes-out-of-stealth-with-230m-in-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in 2024</a>, when Li announced she had raised $230 million for a spatial AI company called World Labs, you might think we were operating at Level 2 or lower. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that was over a year ago, which is a long time in the AI world. Since then, World Labs has shipped both <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/world-labs-ai-can-generate-interactive-3d-scenes-from-a-single-photo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a full world-generating model</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a commercialized product</a> built on top of it. Over the same period, we’ve seen real signs of demand for world-modeling from both video game and special effects industries — and none of the major labs have built anything that can compete. The result looks an awful lot like a Level 4 company, perhaps soon to graduate to Level 5.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-safe-superintelligence-ssi-nbsp\"><strong>Safe Superintelligence (SSI)</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Safe Superintelligence (or SSI) seems like a classic example of a Level 1 startup. Sutskever has gone to great lengths to keep SSI insulated from commercial pressures, to the point of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/19/meta-tried-to-buy-safe-superintelligence-hired-ceo-daniel-gross.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turning down an attempted acquisition from Meta</a>. There are no product cycles and, aside from the still-baking superintelligent foundation model, there doesn’t seem to be any product at all. With this pitch, he raised $3 billion! Sutskever has always been more interested in the science of AI than the business, and every indication is that this is a genuinely scientific project at heart.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the AI world moves fast — and it would be foolish to count SSI out of the commercial realm entirely. On <a href=\"https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ilya-sutskever-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">his recent Dwarkesh appearance</a>, Sutskever gave two reasons why SSI might pivot, either “if timelines turned out to be long, which they might” or because “there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world.” In other words, if the research either goes very well or very badly, we might see SSI jump up a few levels in a hurry. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s resulted in a “de facto  decentralized fleet,” Hammer said, allowing the company to stock just a few different types of batteries to serve hundreds of customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many delivery workers ride into Manhattan from the farther reaches of the city. It’s a trip that can burn a significant portion of their charge, and many workers need two batteries to get through a full day. In response, bodegas started offering e-bike charging services, for which delivery workers typically pay $100 per month. When factoring in battery wear and tear, the total cost nears $2,000 per year, Hammer said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can make the economics work so that we’re actually saving them money right off the bat,” he said. PopWheels charges customers $75 per month for unlimited access to its network, and Hammer said the company has a long waitlist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s charging cabinets can hold 16 batteries, and PopWheels designed them to swiftly extinguish a battery fire should anything go awry during charging. (The company’s founding mission was to stamp out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-e-bike-battery-fires/\">e-bike fires in New York City</a>, which became a significant problem few years ago.) After building some initial cabinets, the company raised a $2.3 million seed round last year 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swap sites are typically small open spaces like parking lots, which PopWheels has retrofit with fences and the necessary electrical connections to support several cabinets. Each cabinet draws about as much electricity as a Level 2 electric vehicle charger, which is to say not that much.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As PopWheels e-bike service grew, the startup began studying other opportunities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There was always a little bit of an underlying thesis that there’s something bigger here,” Hammer said. “If you build urban-scale, fire-safe battery swapping infrastructure, you’re creating an infrastructure layer that lots of people are going to want to get on board with.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hammer started to think about alternative uses for the batteries after someone sent an article about how New York City was working to decarbonize food carts. That’s when the PopWheels team started running the numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Food carts, Hammer estimates, probably spend around $10 a day on gas for their generators to keep the lights on. (Most of the cooking is done via propane, which is a separate matter.) That’s about how much PopWheels would charge someone to subscribe to four of its batteries per day. Conveniently, four of its batteries can supply about five kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is enough to cover the low end of what a typical cart might draw. If they need more juice, Hammer said they can run to a swap station midday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After realizing the math penciled out, PopWheels built a prototype adapter and trialed it at a small event at the Brooklyn Navy Yard at last year’s New York Climate Week. Since then, the startup has been working with the the non-profit Street Vendor Project to move the idea forward.

Pratap adds that she will lead an engineering team focused on accelerating Harvey’s offerings for in-house legal departments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’re bringing to Harvey is deep experience building enterprise AI tools in adjacent problem spaces,” Pratap said. “This expertise helps Harvey move faster in a market that’s becoming increasingly competitive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hexus had raised $1.6 million from Pear VC, Liquid 2 Ventures, and angel investors before the acquisition. While Pratap declined to share deal terms, she said the structure was aligned around “long-term team incentives.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085839\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg 4904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=1200,798 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=1280,852 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=430,286 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=720,479 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=900,599 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=800,532 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=2048,1363 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=668,444 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=564,375 564w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=927,617 927w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=708,471 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI_2319_Original.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition comes as Harvey looks to cement its position as one of AI’s hottest startups.

Andreessen Horowitz led that newest round, joined by new investors T. Rowe Price and WndrCo, alongside existing backers Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Conviction, and angel investor Elad Gil.

That means that across the full-year of 2025, Apple’s market share of shipments rose to a record 9%. This is up from 7% in 2024, Counterpoint Research data shows, making it the iPhone’s strongest year yet in the world’s second-largest smartphone market by volume.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The gains were driven by the iPhone’s product portfolio, growing aspirational demand and wider availability across sales channels, Counterpoint Research’s director for devices and ecosystems, Tarun Pathak, said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple has repeatedly pointed to India as a standout market in recent quarters, with CEO Tim Cook saying the company <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/earnings/AAPL-Q4-2025-earnings_call-369370.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">set an “all-time revenue record in India”</a> on its last earnings call in October. CFO Kevan Parekh also said iPhone’s active install base hit an all-time high in India and the company set a quarterly record for upgraders, highlighting Apple’s push to expand its user base beyond just new buyers, though the company did not disclose detailed figures for India on the call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond shipments, Apple has been widening its footprint in India by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/21/apple-to-move-25-iphone-production-to-india-by-2025-20-ipad-and-apple-watch-to-vietnam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ramping up local manufacturing</a> and broadening its retail reach. Last month, the company <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2025/12/apple-noida-opens-to-customers-this-thursday-december-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">opened its fifth Apple Store</a> in the country — its first in Noida — as part of a broader retail expansion that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/10/apple-to-open-two-retail-stores-in-india-next-week/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">began in 2023</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple is also sharpening its services pitch in India. Earlier this month, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/apple-launches-creator-studio-bundle-of-apps-for-12-99-per-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">introduced Apple Creator Studio</a> — a subscription bundle of creative apps such as Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro — <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2026/01/introducing-apple-creator-studio-an-inspiring-collection-of-creative-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">priced at ₹399 a month</a> ($4.35) in India. That’s around 66% cheaper than the $12.99 a month it charges in the U.S., underscoring how the company is tailoring pricing to deepen its reach in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That strong iPhone year came against a market that has largely stopped growing. India is set to log its fourth straight year at about the same shipment level of 152 million units, Counterpoint estimates, with the October–December quarter down 8–10% year-over-year despite the festive season.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Longer replacement cycles, fewer feature phone users upgrading to smartphones, and the growing popularity of refurbished devices are among the key reasons the market has struggled to grow, Pathak told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even as overall shipments stagnated, India’s premium segment continued to expand. Smartphones priced above ₹30,000 (around $327) grew 15% year-over-year in 2025 and accounted for a record 23% of total shipments — the highest share ever — according to Counterpoint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That shift has helped brands with stronger premium portfolios, including Apple, gain ground even as the mass market slowed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By volume, China’s Vivo led India’s smartphone market in 2025 with a 23% share of shipments, per Counterpoint, followed by Samsung at 15% and Xiaomi at 13%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple remained outside India’s top three by shipments despite its record year, underlining how the market is still dominated by mass-market Android brands even as premium devices take a growing share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Counterpoint expects India’s smartphone market to slip about 2% in 2026, warning that <a href=\"https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/memory-price-tracker-january-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rising memory prices</a> could squeeze demand in the sub-₹15,000 (under-$170) segment and force phone makers to cut cashback offers, trim specifications or raise prices. Even so, average selling prices are forecast to rise 5% in 2026 after a 9% increase in 2025, suggesting the premiumization trend is set to continue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The revised document details the U.S. joint venture’s conditions for using its service, including the specific location information it may collect. Many users are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.threads.com/search?q=immigration%20status%20tiktok&amp;serp_type=default\">also posting to social media</a> about language found in the policy, which says that TikTok could collect sensitive information about its users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But despite the panic, this disclosure isn’t new — and it doesn’t mean what many users fear. The same language appeared in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260121054327/https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en\">TikTok’s privacy policy before the ownership deal closed</a>, and it’s primarily there to comply with state privacy laws like California’s Consumer Privacy Act, which requires companies to agree to disclose to consumers what “sensitive information” is collected. Similar disclosures appear in other social media apps’ policies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To understand why users are concerned — and why the policy reads this way — it helps to look at both the current political climate and the legal requirements TikTok is navigating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specifically, the policy states that TikTok could process information from users’ content or what they may share through surveys, including information about their “racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not surprising that Americans would find this type of language troubling, especially given the current political climate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The escalation of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has led to widespread protests across the country, which have now come to a head in Minnesota. On Friday, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/minnesota-businesses-protest-ice.html\">hundreds of businesses</a> closed their doors <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/ice-minnesota-minneapolis-maine-immigration-01-23-26\">in an economic blackout</a> to protest the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the state.

In TikTok’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260121054327/https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en\">earlier policy,</a> updated on August 19, 2024, the company explained that some of the information it collects and uses may “constitute sensitive personal information” under state privacy laws.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It then proceeded to list those same categories as examples. The legal reason is straightforward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy’s specificity around types of “sensitive information” has to do with state privacy laws, like California’s California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The latter, for instance, requires businesses to inform consumers when they collect “sensitive information,” which the law defines as including things like:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">A consumer’s social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">A consumer’s account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">A consumer’s precise geolocation</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">A consumer’s racial or ethnic origin, citizenship or immigration status, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">The contents of a consumer’s mail, email, and text messages, unless the business is the intended recipient of the communication</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">A consumer’s genetic data</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">A consumer’s neural data</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Biometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying a consumer</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s health</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s sex life or sexual orientation<em><br></em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of note, citizenship and immigration status were specifically added to the category of “sensitive personal information” when California Governor Gavin Newsom <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/citizenship-and-immigration-status-is-2381534\">signed AB-947 into law on October 8, 2023</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because of the in-app alert timed to the deal’s closure (a requirement because of the new legal entity), many people are now reading through TikTok’s terms for the first time. Seeing this language and fearing the worst, they are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.threads.com/search?q=tiktok%20terms&amp;serp_type=default\">posting to social media about their concerns</a> and warning others; some are even threatening to <a rel=\"nofollow\"

class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what TikTok’s policy is actually saying is that, as part of operating its app, it may process sensitive information — especially if it’s the subject of someone’s video — and that it’s agreeing to process that sensitive information “in accordance with applicable law.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy even references the CCPA by name, as an example of the applicable laws TikTok is agreeing to. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“TikTok is required under those laws to notify users in the privacy policy that the sensitive personal information is being collected, how it is being used, and with whom it is being shared,” explains Jennifer Daniels, a partner at the law firm Blank Rome, where she provides counsel on regulatory and general corporate law matters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her colleague, Philip Yannella, co-chair of Blank Rome’s Privacy, Security, and Data Protection Practice, points out that TikTok likely decided to include this language in its privacy policy because of litigation concerns. For instance, he says that lately, he has seen several demands under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) from plaintiffs’ lawyers who alleged “the collection of racial, immigration, and ethnic data.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A similar type of disclosure to TikTok’s can be found in other social media apps, though some companies keep the explanations more high-level, while others, like TikTok, will list out the precise categories that are legally defined as “sensitive information” for additional clarity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, at least one lawyer consulted by TechCrunch noted that spelling out these specific sensitive details so precisely can actually make things less clear to the end users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a point of comparison, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/\">Meta’s privacy policy</a> gets fairly granular, too, though it doesn’t specifically include “immigration status” as one of its examples of sensitive information:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users on social media often share deeply personal topics, explains Ashlee Difuntorum, an associate at Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir (KHIKS) and a business litigator with experience representing software and technology companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“TikTok is essentially saying that if you disclose something sensitive, that information becomes part of the content the platform technically ‘collects,’” she tells TechCrunch. “Policies like this often look alarming because they’re written for regulators and litigators, not for ordinary consumers. That said, the wording can understandably strike users as intrusive when it’s laid out so bluntly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, sharing content on social media sites isn’t without risk, particularly under authoritarian governments that target their own citizens. These apps collect gobs of data, and governments can enact laws to gain access to it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ironically, the decision to move TikTok’s U.S. operations to the U.S. under new ownership was due to this exact concern, but with China then seen as the potential threat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chinese laws require companies to assist with state intelligence and data security, including its 2017 National Intelligence Law and its 2021 Data Security Law. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/tiktok-lamakers-national-security-threat/\">fear among U.S. lawmakers</a> was that TikTok’s ownership by a Chinese entity, ByteDance, could put U.S. citizens at risk, either via surveillance or subtle changes to the app’s algorithm designed to influence people or promote Chinese propaganda. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, people in the U.S. are more worried about their own government’s potential surveillance rather than China’s.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/images-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085719\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/images-3.jpeg 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/images-3.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/images-3.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tv-memes.getyarn.io/yarn-clip/da885afb-c7ca-49c0-8ba0-a2c908c99bbb/gif\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yann LeCun’s new venture, AMI Labs, has drawn intense attention since the AI scientist left Meta to found it. This week, the startup finally confirmed what it’s building — and several key details have been hiding in plain sight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On its <a href=\"https://amilabs.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">newly launched website</a>, the startup disclosed its plans to develop <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/14/what-are-ai-world-models-and-why-do-they-matter/\">“world models”</a> in order to “build intelligent systems that understand the real world.” The focus on world models was already hinted at by AMI’s name, which stands for Advanced Machine Intelligence, but it has now officially joined the ranks of the hottest AI research startups.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building foundational models that bridge AI and the real world has become one of the field’s most exciting pursuits, attracting top scientists and deep-pocketed investors alike — product or no product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">World Labs, a direct rival founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, became a unicorn shortly after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\">coming out of stealth</a>. After <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3080164/world-labs-co-founder-fei-fei-li-shows-off-marble/\">launching its first product</a>, Marble, which generates physically sound 3D worlds, World Labs is now <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/fei-fei-li-s-ai-startup-world-labs-in-funding-talks-at-5-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly in talks</a> to raise fresh funding at a valuation of $5 billion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s little doubt that VCs would be equally eager to invest in LeCun, adding credibility to rumors that AMI Labs might be raising funding <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-19/yann-lecun-s-ami-labs-draws-investor-interest-from-cathay-hiro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">at a $3.5 billion valuation</a>. According to Bloomberg, VCs in talks with the startup include Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital, to which LeCun <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_thrilled-to-be-an-advisor-of-hiro-capital-activity-7404587348480663554-fj9C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is an advisor</a>. Other potential investors reportedly include 20VC, Bpifrance, Daphni, and HV Capital. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regardless of who writes the checks, investors may want to note an important detail: As LeCun has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/yann-lecun-confirms-his-new-world-model-startup-reportedly-seeks-5b-valuation/\">made clear</a>, he is AMI’s executive chairman, not its CEO. Instead, that role belongs to Alex LeBrun, previously co-founder and CEO at Nabla, a health AI startup with offices in Paris and New York.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeBrun’s transition from Nabla to AMI is part of a partnership <a href=\"https://www.nabla.com/press-release/nabla-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-advanced-machine-intelligence-to-pioneer-the-next-era-of-agentic-healthcare-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> last December by Nabla, which develops AI assistants for clinical care and to which LeCun has been an advisor. In exchange for “privileged access” to AMI’s world models, Nabla’s board supported LeBrun’s shift from CEO to chief AI scientist and chairman, clearing the way for his new role.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AMI Labs’ CEO, LeBrun will be surrounded by familiar faces. After Facebook <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/05/facebook-wit-ai/\">acquired his previous startup</a>, Wit.ai, the serial entrepreneur and AI engineer worked under LeCun’s leadership at Meta’s AI research laboratory, FAIR. According to <a href=\"https://www.strategies.fr/actualites/mouvements/LQ5629955C/laurent-solly-rejoint-ami-labs-la-start-de-yann-le-cun.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a>, the duo will also be joined by Laurent Solly, who <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/laurent-solly_after-more-than-12-years-at-meta-the-time-activity-7409193457896017920-aTXZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stepped down</a> as Meta’s vice president for Europe last December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The talent overlap between AMI and Meta likely won’t stop there. LeCun <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131661/yann-lecuns-new-venture-ami-labs/\">told the MIT Technology Review</a> that his former employer could well be AMI’s first client. But he has also been publicly critical of some of Meta’s strategic choices made under Mark Zuckerberg’s direction. More broadly, the Review interprets AMI Labs as a contrarian bet against large language models (LLMs).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The limitations of LLMs that LeCun has pointed out include hallucinations, which are a serious concern in contexts like medicine, as LeBrun also knows firsthand. AMI Labs’ CEO <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2026/01/21/why-yann-lecuns-hot-new-ai-startup-is-targeting-healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told Forbes</a> that a big reason he took the role was the prospect of applying its world models to healthcare. But the startup will also target other high-stakes applied fields.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AMI Labs will advance AI research and develop applications where reliability, controllability, and safety really matter, especially for industrial process control, automation, wearable devices, robotics, healthcare, and beyond,” it wrote in its mission statement. “We share one belief: real intelligence does not start in language. It starts in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike generative approaches, which LeCun and his team see as poorly suited for unpredictable data such as sensor input, the startup promises that its AI systems will not only understand the real world, but also have persistent memory, the ability to reason and plan, and be controllable and safe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup plans to license its technology to industry partners for real-life applications, but says it also plans to contribute to building the future of AI “with the global academic research community via open publications and open source.” LeCun said he plans to keep his professor position at NYU, where he teaches one class per year and supervises PhD and postdoctoral students.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means that the French-born researcher will remain based in New York, but he told the MIT Technology Review that AMI Labs “is going to be a global company [that’s] headquartered in Paris.” The news was welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who <a href=\"https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/intelligence-artificielle/on-est-tres-fiers-emmanuel-macron-veut-tout-faire-pour-que-yann-le-cun-reussisse-depuis-la-france_AN-202601200963.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expressed his pride</a> that LeCun, who is also a Turing Prize winner, chose Paris. “We will do everything we can to ensure his success from France,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup will also have offices in Montreal, New York, and Singapore, but its decision to pick Paris for its headquarters will help consolidate Paris’ reputation as an AI hub, where it will join the ranks of H, Mistral AI and several international labs, including FAIR. It’s fitting, perhaps, that AMI is pronounced a-mee — like “ami” in French, which means “friend,” LeCun has pointed out.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, and the safety board will publish a more detailed final report in 12 to 24 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s the first time Waymo has been investigated by the NTSB, but it’s the second investigation launched into Waymo over its school bus problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opened a similar probe in October</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo also issued <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/waymo-to-issue-software-recall-over-how-robotaxis-behave-around-school-buses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a software recall</a> last year to address the problem. But previous software updates have not been enough to stamp it out, and in Austin, Texas — where the bulk of incidents have been captured on camera — the school district has asked the company to suspend operations during pickup and drop-off times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new investigation comes as Waymo is in the middle of a rapid expansion around the United States. Just this week, the company started offering a robotaxi service in Miami, adding to its operations in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We safely navigate thousands of school bus encounters weekly across the United States, and the Waymo Driver is continuously improving. There have been no collisions in the events in question, and we are confident that our safety performance around school buses is superior to human drivers,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We see this as an opportunity to provide the NTSB with transparent insights into our safety-first approach.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NTSB is different from the NHTSA in that it is not a federal regulatory agency. It cannot issue fines or penalties. Rather, the safety board usually performs deep investigations to identify root causes of problems in the transportation world. When an investigation is complete, the board often holds hearings and issues non-binding recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first notable incident where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus happened last September in Atlanta. The Waymo pulled out of a driveway and crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from the bus’ right side. The robotaxi then turned left and proceeded down the street while kids were getting off the bus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said at the time that the vehicle was unable to see the stop sign or flashing lights, and has since said that it addressed this particular scenario with a software update.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as Waymo patched the specific scenario it encountered in Atlanta, some of the company’s vehicles were caught passing stopped school buses in Austin, Texas. Local news outlet KXAN published videos it received from cameras mounted on school buses that showed Waymo vehicles making illegal maneuvers on <a href=\"https://www.kxan.com/investigations/austin-school-district-said-waymo-continues-to-illegally-pass-its-buses-following-recall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">multiple occasions</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We continue to engage productively with the Austin Independent School District and applaud their reported success in reducing human-driven violations around school buses from 10,000+ a year,” Peña said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We will always cooperate with the relevant authorities and provide any necessary information in response to valid inquiries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deel’s statement then makes its own allegations against Rippling. It points to its own lawsuit that alleges its rival has been on a “smear campaign,” claiming it’s beating the competitor in the market, and adding, “the truth will win in court.” Rippling declined comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is arguably the biggest drama between two HR startups ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To recap, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/rippling-sues-deel-deel-denies-all-legal-wrongdoing-and-slack-is-the-main-witness/\">Rippling sued Deel</a> in May, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/rippling-calls-deel-a-criminal-syndicate-and-claims-4-other-competitors-were-spied-on-too/\">revised the suit in June</a>, alleging that its rival planted a corporate spy. The Rippling employee was caught in a sting operation and confessed to being a paid spy for Deel in an Irish court via a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/the-affidavit-of-a-rippling-employee-caught-spying-for-deel-reads-like-a-movie/\">sworn written statement that reads like a Hollywood movie.</a> The employee testified that he took Rippling’s sales leads, product roadmaps, customer account info, names of superstar employees, whatever was asked for, and handed it over to Deel executives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rippling’s suit, which is ongoing, charged its rival with violations of the federal racketeering law (known as the RICO statute and typically used against organized crime) among other laws it cited. But despite using phrases like “criminal syndicate,” this was a civil suit, not a criminal prosecution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deel countersuited Rippling, also alleging spying by impersonating a customer, among other claims.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-spy-lived-in-fear\">The spy lived in fear</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The man who confessed to spying agreed to testify in Rippling’s case, and Rippling agreed to pay him for legal and travel expenses, according to the man’s cooperation agreement released as a court document and seen by TechCrunch. Deel is now calling the man Rippling’s “paid witness.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the man also went back to court alleging that his family was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/rippling-spy-says-men-have-been-following-him-and-his-wife-is-afraid/\">living in terror because he believed men from Deel</a> were following him. Deel’s lawyer initially denied this but <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/06/25/us-hr-firm-deel-admits-it-instructed-discreet-surveillance-on-manager-at-centre-of-spy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">later discovered that Deel did hire surveillance</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-payment-to-the-spy\">Payment to the spy </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rippling scored the most recent win, at the end of November, <a href=\"https://www.rippling.com/blog/new-banking-records-prove-deel-paid-thief-who-stole-trade-secrets-from-rippling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">when it obtained bank records</a>. The records indicated that Deel transferred funds into an account held by the wife of Deel’s COO, and 56 seconds later that account transferred the same amount to an account held by the confessed spy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, another court document shows that Deel’s founder and CEO Alexandre Bouaziz, who has been called “the mastermind” of the spying plot in Rippling’s lawsuit, has hired high-powered lawyer William Frentzen to represent him. Frentzen is a partner with Morrison Foerster’s white-collar defense group and was formerly the chief of the corporate and securities fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rippling’s lawyer is none other than Alex Spiro of white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel. Spiro is a former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office who is known for his big personality and long list of celeb clients, ranging from Elon Musk to Jay-Z.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So it’s all sounding like a plot from a John Grisham novel, with a sprinkle of the show “Suits” on top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of this has stopped investors from backing Deel or Rippling. In October, Deel announced it hit <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/deel-hits-17-3b-valuation-after-raising-300m-from-big-name-vcs/\">a $17.3 billion valuation</a> after raising $300 million led by Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Rippling hit a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/rippling-raises-450m-at-a-16-8b-valuation-reveals-yc-is-a-customer/\">$16.8 billion valuation in May</a> after raising $450 million from investors like Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs Alternatives, and Y Combinator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/how-would-the-netflix-warner-bros-deal-reshape-hollywood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disrupt Hollywood</a> as we know it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix–WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-has-happened-so-far\">What has happened so far?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) <a href=\"https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revealed it was exploring a potential sale</a> after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/tv-burdened-wbd-will-struggle-cut-cord-2025-06-05/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declining cable viewership</a> and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/david-ellisons-paramount-seen-front-runner-warner-bros-discovery-deal-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Paramount</a> initially viewed as the frontrunner. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But ultimately, WBD’s board determined that Netflix’s offer was the most attractive, despite Paramount offering approximately $108 billion in cash. Paramount’s bid aimed to acquire the entire company, while Netflix’s offer focused specifically on the film, television, and streaming assets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Netflix recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/netflix-revises-offer-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-stave-off-paramount/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">amended its agreement</a> to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per WBD share, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. The deal is valued at approximately $82.7 billion. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-fierce-bidding-war\">A fierce bidding war</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even after Netflix emerged as the preferred buyer, tensions with Paramount remained high, as the rival company continued to pursue Warner Bros.’ assets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD</a> for several months. Still, the board repeatedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rejected</a> its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/paramount-files-lawsuit-against-warner-bros-amidst-controversial-netflix-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed a lawsuit</a> seeking more information about the Netflix deal. The company continues to assert that its offer is far superior.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-regulatory-hurdles\">Regulatory hurdles</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"render of the US Capitol dome on red background\" class=\"wp-image-2024308\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the unprecedented scale and market impact of the deal, regulatory scrutiny is intense and remains a significant obstacle to closing the transaction. Earlier this week, it was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/netflix-s-sarandos-to-testify-in-senate-hearing-on-warner-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the deal, a move that highlights just how seriously lawmakers are taking these concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, prominent lawmakers — Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal —  <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sen-elizabeth-warren-letter-doj-wbd-sale-paramount-1236430180/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division</a>, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Should regulators block the acquisition, Netflix would be obligated to pay a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/netflix-s-5-8-billion-breakup-fee-for-warner-among-largest-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$5.8 billion breakup fee</a>. It remains unclear whether Warner Bros. would remain an independent company or revisit previous acquisition proposals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-concerns-within-the-industry\">Concerns within the industry</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Reactions from the entertainment industry have been largely negative. <a href=\"https://www.wgaeast.org/wga-statement-on-the-acquisition-of-warner-bros-discovery-by-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Writers Guild of America</a> has been among the most vocal critics, demanding that the merger be blocked on antitrust grounds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, insiders worry that the acquisition will squeeze independent creators and diverse voices out of the spotlight, ultimately narrowing the range of stories that get told. There are also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">widespread concerns about potential job losses</a> and lower wages. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For creators and theaters, uncertainty remains around release windows. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has stated that all films planned for theatrical release through Warner Bros. will continue as scheduled. However, he also hinted that, over time, release windows may be shortened, with movies coming to streaming platforms sooner than before.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-should-subscribers-know\">What should subscribers know?</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"netflix logo on black screen backlit by red glow\" class=\"wp-image-2352994\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg 869w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Thibault Penin / Unsplash</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​What does all this mean if you’re a Netflix or HBO Max subscriber? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix executives have reassured viewers that HBO’s operations will remain largely unchanged in the near term.
