The deal uses funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act and represents the first Chips Act award in President Trump’s second term, though it remains preliminary and subject to change.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previous government equity investments under the Trump administration include publicly traded companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/u-s-government-plans-to-take-a-10-stake-in-intel/\">Intel</a>, MP Materials, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/u-s-government-takes-stake-in-canadian-lithium-miner-and-its-nevada-mining-project/\">Lithium Americas</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/10/07/trilogy-metals-shares-skyrocket-250-in-premhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/10/07/trilogy-metals-shares-skyrocket-250-in-premarket-as-trump-acquires-stake/arket-as-trump-acquires-stake/\">Trilogy Metals</a>. Two <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vulcan-reelement-rare-earths-us-government-investment-17647d7219ab8b8098fce5fc66975fdd\">rare earths startups</a> also secured funding in exchange for equity from the Commerce Department last month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can imagine how this is all going over in Silicon Valley, where the libertarian ethos runs deep. At TechCrunch’s signature Disrupt event back in October, Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/sequoias-roelof-botha-warns-founders-about-chasing-sky-high-valuations-as-the-firm-doubles-down-on-its-selective-approach/\">jokingly offered</a> what might be the understatement of the year when asked about the trend: “[Some] of the most dangerous words in the world are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other VCs have similarly expressed concerns, if quietly, about what it means when their portfolio companies are suddenly competing against startups backed by the U.S. Treasury, or even when they find themselves sitting across the table from government representatives at board meetings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The four-year-old, Palo Alto, California, company at the center of this particular experiment is trying to do something genuinely audacious in semiconductor manufacturing. XLight wants to build particle accelerator-powered lasers — machines the size of a football field, mind you — that would create more powerful and precise light sources for making chips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If it works, it could challenge the near-total dominance of ASML, the Dutch giant that has been publicly traded since 1995 and currently enjoys an absolute monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. (Its shares have surged 48.6% this year.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CEO of xLight is Nicholas Kelez, a quantum computing and government labs veteran who presumably knows his way around a particle accelerator. Helping this venture as executive chairman is Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who was shown the door late last year after his ambitious manufacturing revival plans failed to materialize.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I wasn’t done yet,” Gelsinger — who is also a general partner at Playground Global, which led the startup’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-startup-xlight-raises-40-million-race-against-china-key-chip-making-laser-2025-07-22/\">$40 million</a> funding round this summer — told the Journal, adding that the effort is “deeply personal” to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, xLight doesn’t just want to compete with ASML but to go much further. While ASML’s machines work at wavelengths around 13.5 nanometers, xLight is targeting 2 nanometers. Gelsinger claims the technology could boost wafer processing efficiency by 30% to 40% while using far less energy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it happens, both Kelez and Gelsinger will be holding forth at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event on Wednesday night in Palo Alto, where the government’s backing will no doubt come up. (You can still <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/strictlyvc-palo-alto/\">nab a seat here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, for his part, insists this is all in service of national security and technological leadership, saying the partnership could “fundamentally rewrite the limits of chipmaking.” Critics will continue to question whether taxpayer-funded equity stakes represent visionary industrial policy or state capitalism with a patriotic sheen, though even skeptics acknowledge the geopolitical reality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At least Botha, who described himself at Disrupt as a “sort of libertarian, free market thinker by nature,” conceded that industrial policy has its place when national interests demand it. “The only reason the U.S. is resorting to this is because we have other nation states with whom we compete who are using industrial policy to further their industries that are strategic and maybe adverse to the U.S. in long-term interests.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He’ll stick around through spring as an adviser.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His replacement is Amar Subramanya, a highly regarded Microsoft executive who spent 16 years at Google, most recently leading engineering for the Gemini Assistant. It’s a savvy hire, given that Subramanya knows the competition intimately.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move is being characterized as a shake-up. It was seemingly inevitable in retrospect. Apple Intelligence, the company’s answer to the ChatGPT moment, has been stumbling since its October 2024 launch. Reviews have ranged from “underwhelming” to outright alarmed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its first months were some of the roughest. A notification summary feature meant to condense multiple alerts into digestible snippets generated a series of embarrassing, untrue headlines in late 2024 and early 2025. Among other missteps, the BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v778x85yo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">complained twice</a> after Apple Intelligence falsely reported that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself (he hadn’t) and that a darts player, Luke Littler, won a championship before the final <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27zwp7jpxo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">even began</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there was Siri’s promised overhaul, which became a black eye for Apple. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg investigation</a> published in May revealed the depths of Apple’s AI struggles. For instance, when Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, tested the new Siri on his own phone just weeks before its planned launch in April, he was dismayed to find that many of the features the company had been touting didn’t work. The launch was delayed indefinitely, triggering class-action lawsuits from iPhone 16 buyers who’d been promised an AI-powered assistant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By that point, Giannandrea had already been sidelined, according to Bloomberg. The news organization reported that Tim Cook had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/apple-puts-vision-pro-exec-in-charge-of-siri-in-exec-shakeup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stripped Siri</a> from Giannandrea’s oversight entirely back in March, handing it to Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. Apple removed its secretive robotics division from Giannandrea’s control, too.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg’s investigation painted a picture of organizational dysfunction, with weak communication between AI and marketing teams, budget misalignments, and a leadership crisis severe enough that some employees had taken to mockingly calling Giannandrea’s group “AI/MLess.” The report also documented an exodus of AI researchers to competitors, including OpenAI, Google, and Meta.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly now leaning</a> on Google’s Gemini to power the next version of Siri, an astonishing and, presumably, humbling twist considering the intense rivalry between the two companies that dates back more than 15 years, across mobile operating systems, app stores, browsers, maps, cloud services, smart home devices, and now AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Giannandrea came to Apple from Google, where he ran Machine Intelligence and Search. At Apple, he oversaw the AI strategy, machine learning infrastructure, and Siri development.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now Subramanya inherits those responsibilities, reporting to Federighi with a clear mandate to help Apple catch up in AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an interesting moment for the company. While competitors have been pouring billions of dollars into massive AI data centers, Apple has focused on processing AI tasks directly on users’ devices using its custom Apple Silicon chips, a privacy-first approach that avoids collecting user data. (When more complex requests require cloud processing, Apple routes them through Private Cloud Compute, servers that promise to process data temporarily and delete it immediately.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether that philosophy pays off or whether it has permanently left Apple behind is an outstanding question. Apple’s approach comes with clear trade-offs. Among them, on-device models are smaller and less capable than the massive models running in competitors’ data centers, and Apple’s reluctance to collect user data has left its researchers training models on licensed and synthetic data rather than the giant troves of real-world information that fuel its rivals’ systems.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the risk is AI that feels more like surveillance than service.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SwNPqsOXkk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">episode</a> of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/what-is-google-gemini-ai/\">Gemini</a> was still known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/19/googles-bard-chatbot-can-now-tap-into-your-google-apps-double-check-answers-and-more/\">Bard</a>. More recently, it <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/deep-research-workspace-app-integration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">began pulling personal data</a> into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/30/gemini-will-now-automatically-summarize-your-long-emails-unless-you-opt-out/\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/googles-gemini-can-now-help-you-schedule-google-calendar-meetings/\">Calendar</a> and Drive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as Google integrates more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/19/googles-bard-chatbot-can-now-tap-into-your-google-apps-double-check-answers-and-more/\">personal data</a> into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/google-maps-bakes-in-gemini-to-improve-navigation-and-hands-free-use/\">location history</a>, and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That, Stein said, would be “much more useful” than just showing users a more generic list of the best-selling products in a given category. “That is, I think, very much the vision — of building something that can be really knowledgeable for you, specifically.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This idea isn’t all that different from how the “Others” in the hit Apple TV show “Pluribus” have gobbled up the world’s knowledge, including intimate details about individuals. When the system interacts with the show’s protagonist, Carol, it uses that data to personalize everything: cooking her favorite meals, adopting a familiar face to handle its communications with her, and otherwise anticipating her needs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Carol doesn’t find the personalized responses kind; she finds them invasive. She never consented to sharing her data with the hivemind, yet it knows her better than she’d like.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, it seems that avoiding Google’s data-gobbling ways will get increasingly difficult in the AI era, and if Google doesn’t get the balance right, the results could feel more creepy than useful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(To be clear: Google <em>does</em> let you control the apps Gemini uses to make its AI more knowledgeable about you specifically — it’s under “Connected Apps” in Gemini’s <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">settings</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you do share app data with Gemini, Google <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?dark=1&amp;sjid=17783156566859743275-NA&amp;visit_id=639002230735023711-3962094755&amp;ref_topic=15294201&amp;rd=1#pn_connected_apps\">says</a> it will save and use that data according to the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?dark=1&amp;sjid=17783156566859743275-NA&amp;visit_id=639002230735023711-3962094755&amp;ref_topic=15294201&amp;rd=1#pn_connected_apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gemini privacy policy</a>. And that policy reminds users that human reviewers may read some of their data and not to “enter confidential information that you wouldn’t want a reviewer to see or Google to use to improve its services.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as more data gets ingested into Google’s own hivemind, it’s easy to see how AI could make data privacy more of a gray area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, however, believes it has a solution of sorts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stein says that Google will indicate when its AI responses are personalized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think people want to intuitively understand when they’re being personalized — when information is made for them, versus when [it’s] something that everyone would see if they were to ask this question,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stein noted, too, that Google could send a push notification to users when a product they had been considering after several days of online research becomes available or is on sale.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are all these ways that Google now, across modes, across kind of different aspects of your life, [is] being incredibly helpful to you…” he said. “And I think that’s more of how I think of the future of search than any one specific feature or single form factor.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just over a year after adding climate risk scores, Zillow has removed them from more than 1 million listings after real estate agents complained that the information was causing them to lose sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zillow first added the data to the site in September 2024, <a href=\"https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-09-26-Zillow-introduces-First-Streets-comprehensive-climate-risk-data-on-for-sale-listings-across-the-US#:~:text=Zillow%20introduces%20First%20Street's%20comprehensive,the%20US%20-%20Sep%2026,%202024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">saying</a> that more than 80% of buyers consider climate risks when purchasing a new home. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But last month, following objections from the California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS), Zillow removed the listings’ climate scores. In their place is a subtle link to their records at First Street, the climate risk analytic startup that provides the data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When buyers lack access to clear climate-risk information, they make the biggest financial decision of their lives while flying blind,” First Street spokesperson Matthew Eby told TechCrunch via email. “The risk doesn’t go away; it just moves from a pre-purchase decision into a post-purchase liability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First Street’s climate risk scores first appeared on Realtor.com in 2020, where they remain. They  also still appear on Redfin and and Homes.com.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York-based startup has raised more than $50 million from investors including General Catalyst, Congruent Ventures, and Galvanize Climate Solutions, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Art Carter, the CRMLS CEO, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/climate/zillow-climate-risk-scores-homes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told</a> The New York Times that “displaying the probability of a specific home flooding this year or within the next five years can have a significant impact on the perceived desirability of that property.” He also questioned the accuracy of First Street’s data, saying he didn’t think that areas which haven’t flooded in the last 40 to 50 years were likely to flood in the next five.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t the first time real estate agents have complained about climate risk scores. Last year, when Zillow introduced the feature, one agent in Massachusetts told the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/10/17/science/zillow-climate-change-risk-scores-massachusetts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Boston Globe</a> that the risk scores were “putting thoughts in people’s minds about my listing that normally wouldn’t be there.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First Street defended its data. “Our models are built on transparent, peer-reviewed science and are continuously validated against real-world outcomes,” Eby said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the CRMLS coverage area, during the Los Angeles wildfires, our maps identified over 90 percent of the homes that ultimately burned as being at severe or extreme risk — our highest risk rating — and 100 percent as having some level of risk, significantly outperforming CalFire’s official state hazard maps,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Official hazard maps have been criticized in recent years for either being out of date or underestimating a property’s level of risk. Nearly twice as many properties carry a 1% annual risk of flooding — a so-called 100-year flood — than are listed on Federal Emergency Management Agency’s flood maps, which are used to designate which properties are required to carry flood insurance, according to a <a href=\"https://kinder.rice.edu/urbanedge/outdated-and-inaccurate-fema-flood-maps-fail-fully-capture-risk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Louisiana State University analysis</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The real estate and insurance industries have been racing to keep up with worsening weather wrought by climate change. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If buildings are on fire or underwater, they don’t have much value,” Peter Gajdoš, partner at proptech venture capital firm Fifth Wall, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/why-the-next-big-entrepreneur-must-come-from-climate-tech/\">wrote</a> for TechCrunch four years ago. “We are discussing these issues with large insurers and the interest is unprecedented.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors, insurers, and cities are likely to continue using data from companies like First Street to determine where climate risks lie. In offering homebuyers access to the same data, Zillow helped level the playing field. But thanks to the objections of real estate agents, consumers have one more hoop to jump through.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms for millions of businesses to build and manage online stores. The company <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/online-shopping-trends-ecommerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> Shopify merchants handle over 10% of all e-commerce transactions in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issues began surfacing around 6:45 a.m. PT, when select merchants reported difficulties logging into their Shopify accounts. Additionally, many faced challenges accessing point-of-sale (POS) systems, preventing them from processing transactions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shopify’s status page recently confirmed that the company had identified and remedied the cause of the problem: its login authentication flow, which explains the POS login complications. Shopify stated that it’s now seeing signs of recovery and that it will continue monitoring the situation. It also advised merchants that its Help Center was experiencing longer-than-normal wait times for support as a result of today’s outage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exact number of affected merchants is unclear. However, <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/status/shopify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Downdetector</a>, a website that tracks user-submitted reports about website issues, noted there were about 4,000 outage incidents.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The company claims this is the first vision language action model focused on autonomous driving. Visual language models can process both text and images together, allowing vehicles to “see” their surroundings and make decisions based on what they perceive.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new model is based on Nvidia’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/nvidia-releases-its-own-brand-of-world-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cosmos-Reason model</a>, a reasoning model that thinks through decisions before it responds. Nvidia initially released the Cosmos model family in January 2025. Additional <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/nvidia-unveils-new-cosmos-world-models-other-infra-for-physical-applications-of-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">models were released</a> in August.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Technology like the Alpamayo-R1 is critical for companies looking to reach level 4 autonomous driving, which means full autonomy in a defined area and under specific circumstances, Nvidia said in a <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/neurips-open-source-digital-physical-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia hopes that this type of reasoning model will give autonomous vehicles the “common sense” to better approach nuanced driving decisions like humans do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new model is available on GitHub and Hugging Face.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the new vision model, Nvidia also uploaded new step-by-step guides, inference resources, and post-training workflows to GitHub — collectively called the Cosmos Cookbook — to help developers better use and train Cosmos models for their specific use cases. The guide covers data curation, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These announcements come as the company is pushing full-speed into physical AI as a new avenue for its advanced AI GPUs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia’s co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that the <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-2024-jensen-huang/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">next wave of AI is physical AI</a>.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech YouTuber <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/06/marques-brownlee-interview-mkbhd-vidcon/\">Marques Brownlee</a>, or MKBHD, announced on Monday that his phone wallpaper app <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/24/tech-youtuber-mkbhds-panels-app-is-a-bit-underwhelming/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Panels</a> is shutting down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fans had high hopes for Brownlee’s foray into app development, given his reputation as an eagle-eyed tech reviewer who has amassed more than 20 million followers on YouTube. He’s so influential that some blamed his commentary on Humane AI and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/fisker-ocean-braking-power-loss-problems-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fisker</a> for those companies’ eventual failures. (We think the real issue is that you shouldn’t raise <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/08/humane-the-secretive-ai-startup-founded-by-ex-apple-employees-raises-another-100m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$230 million</a> if you have no product.) Yet from the time Brownlee launched Panels in September 2024, the app struggled to find an audience of its own.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We knew it was niche, but we made mistakes in making our first app, and ultimately, we weren’t able to turn it into the vision I had,” Brownlee said in an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICuEkKYAVk0&amp;t=1s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unlisted YouTube video</a>. In a <a href=\"https://panels.art/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>, he added that “the makeup of the development team changed,” and he was unable to find the right collaborators to grow the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brownlee was inspired to create Panels because when he posts video reviews of phones, tablets, and computers, fans always point out how stunning his wallpapers and lock screens are. When he first announced the app, he pointed out that if you type “where does mkbhd …” into Google, one of the first suggestions is “… get his wallpapers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Panels partnered with artists to sell distinct, high-resolution wallpapers, which users could access at a cost of $50 per year, or $12 per month (the artists got a cut of those payments). But Brownlee couldn’t overcome the challenge of trying to create a paying market for something that consumers are not accustomed to paying for — it’s easier to just pull an image from the internet, or take a cute photo of your dog.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thanks to Brownlee’s stature, Panels ranked No. 1 on the iOS and Google Play charts for photos apps during its launch month. The app couldn’t sustain that momentum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the app intelligence firm Appfigures, Panels reached about 900,000 lifetime downloads and $95,000 in consumer spending across iOS and Android. Last month, the app only received 3,000 downloads and $500 in consumer spending, dipping too low to rank on U.S. app stores.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per Panels’ own disclosure, users downloaded more than 2 million wallpapers from the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Panels will begin to refund users with active annual subscriptions when the app officially shuts down on December 31, 2025. However, Panels’ blog post outlines ways for customers to get their money back quicker.

He now makes over $100,000 annually. “I pinch myself going to work every day,” the 51-year-old tells the Journal. In Oregon, electrical safety specialist Marc Benner pulls in $225,000 a year, while electrician Andrew Mason makes over $200,000 managing workers at six Northern Virginia data centers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Journal reports this isn’t just about higher base pay. Companies are sweetening the pot with perks like heated break tents, free lunches, daily incentive bonuses, and even remote project management positions. One construction site offers workers $100 in daily incentive pay, which can add up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The surge comes as tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to build hundreds of new data centers, colliding with an industry-wide shortage of roughly 439,000 skilled workers, according to the Associated Builders and Contractors trade group. </p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Much of that growth will occur in more rural areas as facilities grow in size and as sites near urban areas become scarce, <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/ai-and-the-power-grid-where-the-rubber-meets-the-road/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BloombergNEF said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Driving part of the growth is the sheer scale of planned data centers. Today, only 10% of data centers draw more than 50 megawatts of electricity, but over the next decade, the average new facility will draw well over 100 megawatts. The biggest sites help skew the data: Nearly a quarter will be larger than 500 megawatts, and a few will exceed 1 gigawatt. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?w=680\" alt=\"A chart illustrating data center electricity use through 2032.\" class=\"wp-image-3071402\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png 4555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=1200,762 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=1280,813 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=430,273 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=720,457 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=900,571 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=800,508 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=1536,975 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=2048,1300 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=668,424 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=591,375 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=972,617 972w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=708,450 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Planned data centers are significantly larger than those currently in operation</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>BloombergNEF</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, the utilization rate for all data centers is expected to grow from 59% to 69% as AI training and inference grows to nearly 40% of total data center compute.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some ways, the findings in the new report aren’t surprising. AI companies have been racing to build more powerful data centers, helping to drive global investment in the facilities up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/data-centers-now-attract-more-investment-than-finding-new-oil-supplies/\">$580 billion this year</a>. That’s more than the world spends finding new supplies of oil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the new report shows just how quickly the landscape is changing. It is a sharp revision upwards from a document the group published in April. The upswing was driven by a surge in new projects that have been announced since then. “With an average seven-year timeline for projects to come online, developments in earlier stages affect the tail end of our forecast the most,” the new report said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early-stage projects have more than doubled between early 2024 and early 2025, though those are distinct from projects that have been committed or are currently under construction. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of that new capacity is being planned for Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey.

Texas’s Ercot grid will see a large number of additions, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The report arrives as the PJM Interconnection is under scrutiny from its independent monitor, Monitoring Analytics. The group filed a <a href=\"https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20251125-5275&amp;optimized=false&amp;sid=53de8368-82a1-4e72-a2c3-b9a3fbc0073c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">complaint</a> with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) saying that PJM has the authority to authorize new data center connections only when its grid has adequate capacity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As part of its obligation to maintain reliability, PJM has the authority to require large new data center loads to wait to be added to the system until the loads can be served reliably,” Monitoring Analytics wrote. “PJM has the authority to create a load queue.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, data centers are responsible for today’s high electricity prices within the region, the organization said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“PJM’s failure to clarify and enforce its existing rules and to protect reliable and affordable service in PJM is unjust and unreasonable,” it said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. <strong>This <em>stream</em> is brought to you in partnership with AWS.</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By design, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on public blockchains that allow law enforcement, as well as blockchain intelligence firms such as Chainalysis and Elliptic, to follow the money over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Authorities said they seized $25 million euros ($29 million) in Bitcoin, along with three servers, 12 terabytes of data, and the official domain <a href=\"http://cryptomixer.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cryptomixer.io</a>, which now displays the customary law enforcement seizure splash page. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Europol, the site “facilitated the obfuscation of criminal funds for ransomware groups, underground economy forums and dark web markets,” and claimed its software “blocked the traceability of funds on the blockchain.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Deposited funds from various users were pooled for a long and randomised period before being redistributed to destination addresses, again at random times. As many digital currencies provide a public ledger of all transactions, mixing services make it difficult to trace specific coins, thus concealing the origin of cryptocurrency,” Europol said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cryptomixer offered customers anonymity, such as providing cover for cybercriminals who wanted to launder their crypto before taking the funds to legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges. Europol said the “cleaned” cryptocurrency could be swapped for other cryptocurrencies or fiat cash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, authorities have shut down or sanctioned several similar services, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/08/treasury-tornado-cash-laundering-stolen-crypto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tornado</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/two-founders-behind-russian-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash-charged-by-u-s-federal-courts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-seizure-over-28-million-cryptocurrency-cash-and-other-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ChipMixer</a>, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. <strong>This <em>stream</em> is brought to you in partnership with AWS.</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Originally designed to add holiday lights to your <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/holiday-app-festivitas-puts-xmas-lights-on-your-mac/\">Mac’s desktop,</a> this popular indie app has been updated this year with several new features, most notably a version of the app that brings its sparkling, colorful lights to iOS devices for the first time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new Festivitas app for iPhone and iPad, you can add and customize a string of holiday lights on your device’s Home Screen using iOS widgets. The lights can frame your favorite personal photo (or perhaps a holiday image you dig up on Pinterest), and you can opt to make the widget transparent so it blends in with your background.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071349\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=555,1200 555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=592,1280 592w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=199,430 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=333,720 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=416,900 416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=370,800 370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=309,668 309w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=285,617 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=245,531 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Festivitas</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While seasonal apps can sometimes be low-quality cash grabs, developer Simon Støvring puts genuine effort and thoughtfulness into Festivitas’ design — and doesn’t charge an arm and a leg, either. Instead, the app is available for free to consumers, with premium features that can be unlocked for a fair price of between $3.99 and $9.99. (You get to choose the price that works best for you.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On both macOS and iOS, you can customize the holiday lights in multiple ways, beyond picking their colors and flashing pattern. You can adjust the cable’s thickness, its drop width and height, and choose from pre-made color palettes like Candy Cane, Winter Snow, Elf, and others, or you can design your own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also make finer adjustments to things like the colors’ hue or temperature, the speed of the flashes, and the spacing between the lights.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/light-settings.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071355\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Festivitas</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another perk is that you’ll be able to use the lights again outside of the winter holidays, as you can now change the bulb shape to designs like a bat, clover, Easter egg, heart, ghost, star, “2026,” and more throughout the year. This lets you continue to enjoy the app for other holidays and special events — there’s even a “WWDC” bulb for celebrating Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another new feature this year is a snow effect for the Mac app, which adds floating snowflakes to your desktop. You can customize this experience, making the flakes gently drift down toward your dock, or increase the snow amount, fall speed, flake size, and wind, transforming it into what looks like a blizzard.

If those companies succeed, OpenAI’s stake will grow, and it will get compensated for its services, according to a source familiar with the matter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership follows a pattern of<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/video/the-circular-money-problem-at-the-heart-of-ais-biggest-deals/\"> circular dealmaking</a> for the $500 billion AI giant, which also recently took stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/in-another-chess-move-with-microsoft-openai-is-pouring-12b-into-coreweave/#:~:text=In%20a%20grandmaster%2Dlevel%20chess%20move%2C%20OpenAI%20has,with%20the%20GPU%2Dheavy%20cloud%20service%20provider%20CoreWeave.\"> CoreWeave</a>. For instance, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy Nvidia chips. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Thrive deal has a different structure, but the result is still interdependence. Here is how it will work. OpenAI embeds its own workers to build products and implement systems in Thrive’s portfolio companies. OpenAI profits when those companies scale based on growth its work helped generate.<br><br>Thrive Holdings pushed back on the circular characterization. A spokesperson emphasized the deal is “responding to an unmet need in the market” rather than creating demand and pointed to organic customer interest from portfolio companies like accounting firm Crete, which has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/thrive-backed-accounting-firm-crete-spend-500-million-ai-roll-up-2025-06-04/\">reportedly</a> saved hundreds of hours of work with AI tools, and IT firm Shield that predated the formal partnership. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But for outside investors, the embedded nature of OpenAI’s involvement – and the overlapping ownership with Thrive Capital holding stakes on both sides – makes it difficult to assess whether success stems from genuine market traction or from advantages that may not scale without OpenAI’s direct support. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Analysts will be watching to see if Thrive-owned firms actually succeed in building long-term profitable businesses using OpenAI’s tech, or if the result is really just pumped-up valuations based on speculative market potential. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to provide more detail into the nature of the deal.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

By releasing early, Deezer beats other streaming music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, in providing an annual summary of listeners’ favorite songs, artists, albums, and genres for 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature, called “My Deezer Year,” offers users a detailed overview of their top tracks, top artists, favorite albums, and the amount of time spent listening to their most-played artist and their best track. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year’s edition introduces a new “romantic comedy” theme for the recap’s visual presentation.

In the U.S., Amazon sessions that resulted in a purchase surged 100% on Black Friday compared with the trailing 30 days, while sessions that resulted in a purchase and didn’t include Rufus increased by only 20%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Amazon saw a 75% day-over-day increase for sessions that included Rufus and resulted in a purchase, compared with just a 35% day-over-day increase for sessions without Rufus that had resulted in a purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm also noted that Amazon sessions that involved the AI chatbot outpaced total website sessions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Black Friday, Amazon’s total website sessions increased by 20% day-over-day, while those that involved Rufus were up by 35%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s AI chat was first launched into beta in early 2024 before rolling out to all U.S. customers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/amazon-ai-chatbot-rufus-is-now-live-for-all-u-s-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">later that year</a>. Today, Rufus helps Amazon shoppers find products, get recommendations, and perform product comparisons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rufus’ adoption to drive Black Friday sales is part of a broader surge in consumers turning to AI to help them with holiday shopping, data shows.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-05-at-5.18.22%E2%80%AFPM-e1709677222431.png?w=680\" alt=\"Amazon Rufus\" class=\"wp-image-2675035\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to e-commerce data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday. This indicates that consumers more heavily embraced generative AI chatbots to find deals and research products this year. The AI tools were mostly used for popular Black Friday deal categories like electronics, video games, appliances, toys, personal care items, and baby and toddler products. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe Analytics also noted that the use of AI increased conversions. It found U.S. shoppers who came to a retail site from an AI service were 38% more likely to buy, compared with non-AI traffic sources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether AI directly contributed to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/29/black-friday-sets-online-spending-record-of-11-8b-adobe-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">record Black Friday spending</a> of $11.8 billion is less clear. Instead, the sizable figure this year could be due to higher prices, not an increase in online shopping. As TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/29/black-friday-sets-online-spending-record-of-11-8b-adobe-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reported</a> on Saturday, Salesforce data showed prices were up by an average of 7%, while order volumes were down by 1%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sensor Tower’s data similarly suggests that consumers were perhaps being more conservative in their spending this year, likely due to economic strains. Even though mobile app and website adoption spiked on Black Friday compared to the previous 30 days, gains in total visits and downloads decelerated from 2024, its data indicated. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Amazon’s and Walmart’s mobile app downloads grew by 24% and 20%, respectively on Black Friday, compared with the previous 30 days.

At that point, about a year ago, he felt he was ready to find investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I literally made a list of the top five media investors in the world,” Joseph recalled. His product uses AI to help companies track what the world says about them and their competitors in the press, across podcasts, and in social media. So he wanted investors who understood that scene. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Cuban, who has founded media networks, starred on “Shark Tank,” written books, produced movies, and is regularly interviewed on TV, was at the top of Joseph’s list. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So,<strong> </strong>one evening in late 2024, Joseph drank a beer for courage and sent a one-page investment pitch via cold email to everyone on the list. No warm intro.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cuban, alone, answered. It turns out, busy and inundated with pitches as he is, Cuban still scans his own emails. He’s always looking for his next deal. “I have literally invested tens of millions of dollars from emails, and a lot of them have paid off, turned into unicorns,” Cuban tells TechCrunch about why he answered Clipbook.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But before Cuban cracked open his checkbook, he put Joseph through a series of tests. His first email response “was the most skeptical 20 questions that he could ever ask,” Joseph recalled. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cuban admits he’s fairly famous for that from “Shark Tank.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I start to pepper them, they wilt, right? They wilt or they get angry at a certain level,” Cuban explained. “It’s their baby. They don’t like to be questioned, yeah? But Adam was just like, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After answering every question to Cuban’s satisfaction, the billionaire then asked Joseph to prove the product by producing a report for Cuban’s own baby: <a href=\"https://www.costplusdrugs.com/medications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CostPlus Drugs</a>. That’s an online pharmacy and public benefit corporation he co-founded in 2022 that prices drugs affordably at cost plus 15%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know what a pain in the ass it is to do the research for PR and for marketing, and to learn about [competitor] companies, and to find out what people are saying about your own company,” Cuban explained. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2774370\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not that Clipbook doesn’t have plenty of competitors that also do this work. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/sprinklr/\">Sprinklr</a> is among the best known, but others include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/26/tiktok-partners-hootsuite-sprinklr-emplifi/\">Sprout Social, Emplify,</a> Hootsuite, and more.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joseph contends that Clipbook is different because it was built from the ground up to be AI native. That means it doesn’t just scan for keywords, but it understands the context of how those words are used. It knows that media references to “cost” and “drugs” is not the same as looking for CostPlus Drugs. It knows the difference between any person named “Adam Joseph” and the one who is the founder of Clipbook. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being AI-native (not an AI bolt-on) also helps it search where other products struggle to go, such as audio and video references in podcasts, Joseph contends. He built this product after doing PR work for Boston Consulting Group and so experienced the pain of media sentiment research firsthand, he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joseph speedily produced the report for Cuban that really “nailed” relevant references, Cuban says. He was especially impressed when it unearthed a previously unknown podcast conversation about pharmacy benefit services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a few days of negotiating, Cuban agreed to send Joseph a term sheet. The first part of that seed round closed in early 2025 and other investors piled in over the next few months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joseph declined to share updated ARR figures with TechCrunch from since his seed round closed — except to say the company has grown since its first million. But the company now counts 200 companies as customers, including Weber Shandwick and his old employer, the Boston Consulting Group, he says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. <strong>This stream is brought to you in partnership with AWS.</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
