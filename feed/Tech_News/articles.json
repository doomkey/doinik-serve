The appeal is obvious: if you’ve ever worn cashmere, you know it’s soft, light, and warm — an impressive fiber that’s hard to give up. Unfortunately, those bargain prices usually come with a catch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cashmere comes from the fine undercoat of a handful of goat breeds. Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That’s not a lot of supply for a growing market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.everbloom.bio/\">Everbloom</a>, told TechCrunch. “What you’re seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they’re being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it’s creating unsustainable herding practices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/hyundai-is-working-with-a-startup-on-plant-based-leather-that-smells-like-the-real-thing/\">upcycled material</a> that’s nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.everbloom.bio/braid-ai\">Braid.AI</a>. The model can fine tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its core, Everbloom’s process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: they’re all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom’s process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All the components that we’re using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, it should be cheaper, too. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don’t believe in a ‘sustainable premium’” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That’s what we’re aiming for.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Nordic red-hot startup movement continues. On Tuesday, Neil Murray, founder and general partner at Copenhagen-based firm The Nordic Web Ventures, announced the close of a $6 million Fund III to continue investing in early-stage founders in the region.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fund will focus on writing the first institutional checks to companies focused on robotics, AI-native companies, and deep tech founders.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murray, a solo GP, told TechCrunch that his first two funds were “test vehicles” to prove his ability to spot and invest in top talent in the region. Now, seven years later, he has written the first check into more than 50 companies, with a portfolio including the unicorn Lovable and the remote worker <a href=\"https://safetywing,/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">insurance company SafetyWing</a>, and exits like the UI design company Uizard.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TechCrunch previously reported, the Nordic ecosystem (which includes Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/breaking-down-the-boom-in-the-nordics-startup-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">is now valued at more than half a trillion dollars</a> and received more than $8 billion in venture funding in 2024, making the region one of the hottest emerging markets in Europe. Murray said Fund III had more than $20 million in investor interest, but he decided to cap it at $6 million because he cares “more about alignment than AUM.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Staying small, he said, means he can better tie incentives to performance rather than management fees. He also said staying small, especially as a solo GP, gives him more flexibility while “everyone else is still debating.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Capping the fund wasn’t a constraint,” he said. “It was the strategy.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The check sizes for the fund will be around $200,000, and he hopes to back between 30 and 35 companies. “I believe it is more important to be investing in Tier 1 founders than to back Tier 2 founders and over-optimizing for ownership,” he said.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murray’s limited partner base includes institutional backers such as Allocater One, founder Christoph Janz, and Pacenotes. Founders from Kahoot! And Pleo, in addition to operators from Meta and Google, is also LPs in Fund III. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many founders from my first two funds have invested in my new fund, which is also an incredibly important metric to me,” he said, adding that he’s already returned more than half the capital he raised across Fund I and Fund II. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His Fund III focuses on AI, robotics, and consumer, he said, because those are some of the top sectors in the Nordic region. Consumer has always been a top category in the sector, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/the-nordic-startup-scene-has-quietly-become-one-of-techs-fastest-growing-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as TechCrunch previously spoke about</a> on a podcast about the region. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The region is also known for its computer science, engineering culture, and manufacturing, which, paired with a “calm methodical build style,” positions the Nordics well for “AI-powered robotics in industrial, healthcare, logistics, and increasingly consumer context.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though he has a keen interest in the Nordics, Murray actually hails from the UK and moved to Denmark in 2013 without knowing a single person, he recalled. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was very interested in tech startups, having worked in digital products in London,” he continued. When he moved to Copenhagen, he realized the ecosystem has had a big contribution to the tech world, though people hardly spoke up about it. That led him to start the website “The Nordic Web,” where he broke down what was happening behind the curtains of the bugeoning tech scene there. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That website saw him tracking investments and exits and soon, VCs were asking him which founders were looking for capital. Soon, Murray wanted in on the action, and in 2017, launched a $500,000 Fund I. He stopped writing The Nordic Web shortly after to focus more on investing. And all of that has led him here. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Overall, the Nordics aren’t experiencing a ‘moment,’” he said. “They’re experiencing a compounding. The depth of talent, the ambition level, and the maturity of the ecosystem mean this wave isn’t a spike; it’s the foundation of the next decade of Nordic breakout companies.”  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chien compares some of those applications to the simple flashlight, which was initially a popular third-party download after the iPhone launched in 2008 but was quickly integrated into iOS itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He argued that, just as it took a few years for the smartphone platform to solidify before game-changing consumer apps emerged, AI platforms need a similar period of “stabilization” for lasting AI consumer products to flourish.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we’re right on the cusp of the equivalent to mobile of the 2009-2010 era,” Chien said. That period was the birth of massive mobile-first consumer businesses like Uber and Airbnb.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We could be seeing inklings of that stabilization with Google’s Gemini reaching technological parity with ChatGPT, Chien said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elizabeth Weil, founder and partner at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/in-a-crowded-vc-landscape-elizabeth-weils-scribble-ventures-shows-that-networks-still-matter/\">Scribble Ventures</a>, echoed Chien’s sentiment about the early days of GenAI, describing the current state of consumer AI applications as being in an “awkward teenage middle ground.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What will it take for consumer AI startups to grow up? Possibly a new device beyond the smartphone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s unlikely that a device that you pick up 500 times a day but only sees 3% to 5% of what you see is going to be what ultimately introduces the use cases that take full advantage of AI’s capabilities,” Chien said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weil agreed that a smartphone may be too limiting for reimagining consumer AI products in large part because it is not ambient. “I don’t think we’re going to be building for this in five years,” she said, indicating her iPhone as she showed it to the audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups and incumbent tech companies have been racing to build a new personal device that can supplant smartphones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI and Apple’s former design chief, Jony Ive, are working on what’s rumored to be a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/altman-describes-openais-forthcoming-ai-device-as-more-peaceful-and-calm-than-the-iphone/\">“screenless,” pocket-sized device.</a> Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/\">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> are controlled by a wristband that detects subtle gestures. Meanwhile, a number of startups are trying, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">with often disappointing results</a>, to introduce a pin, pendant, or ring that uses AI in a way different from how smartphones do.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, not every AI consumer product will be dependent on a new device. Chien suggested that one such offering could be a personal AI financial adviser customized to the user’s specific needs. Similarly, Weil anticipates that a personalized, “always-on” tutor will become ubiquitous, with its specialized tutelage delivered directly from a smartphone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though excited by AI’s potential, Weil and Chien expressed skepticism about the emergence of several, still-stealthy AI-powered social network startups. Chien said these companies are building networks where thousands of AI bots are interacting with the user’s content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It turns social into a single-player game. I’m not sure that it works,” he said. “The reason that people enjoy social networking is the understanding that there are real humans on the other side.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The next video is similar, except that it’s a supercut of us saying “umm” over and over.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, Riverside scans its AI-generated transcripts of your recordings to find what single word you said more than any other (we’re assuming they cut out words like “and” or “the”).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a bit ironic, but on my <a href=\"https://www.wowiftrue.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">podcast about internet culture</a>, my co-host and I said “book” more often than any other word (this was probably skewed by our subscriber-only “book club” recordings… or the fact that my co-host has a book coming out, which we <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/sublimation-isabel-j-kim/75bdbf4afed5475f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plug incessantly</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another show on our podcast network, <a href=\"https://spiritspodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Spirits</a>, said “Amanda” more often than any other word (not because they’re obsessed with me, but because they also have a host named Amanda).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the podcast network’s Slack, we exchanged our Rewind videos. There’s something inherently funny about a video of people saying “umm” over and over. But we also know what these videos represent: our creative tools are becoming more saturated with AI features, many of which we do not want or need. The Riverside Rewind points to the uselessness of these tools themselves — why would I need a video of my co-host and I saying the word “book” over and over? It’s good for a quick laugh, but there’s no substance.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though I enjoyed Riverside’s AI recap, its arrival comes at a time when my industry peers are losing opportunities to create, edit, and produce new podcasts, thanks to the same AI tools that generated our Rewind videos. But while AI allows us to automate away some tasks — like editing out our “umms” and dead air — podcasting itself is not that mechanical. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI can quickly generate a transcript of my podcast, which is important for accessibility reasons, helping to automate an activity that used to be incredibly time-consuming and tedious. However, AI is not able to make editorial choices around how to maneuver audio or video to tell a story effectively. Unlike the human editors I work with, AI cannot determine when a tangential conversation in a podcast is funny and when it should be cut because it’s boring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the rise of personalized AI audio tools, like Google’s NotebookLM, its ability to serve as a creation tool has also seen high-profile failures, as of late. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, The Washington Post started to roll out personalized, AI-generated podcasts about the news of the day. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can see why this would seem like a “good” idea to profit-hungry execs — instead of paying a team to do the intensive work of researching, recording, editing, and distributing a daily show, you could automate it — except you can’t. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The podcasts spouted <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/12/11/2025/washington-posts-ai-generated-podcasts-rife-with-errors-fictional-quotes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">made-up quotes</a> and factual errors, which is existentially dangerous for a news organization. According to Semafor, the Post’s internal testing found that <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/12/14/2025/iterate-through-why-the-washington-post-launched-an-error-ridden-ai-product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">between 68% and 84% </a>of the AI podcasts failed to meet the publication’s standards. This seems like a fundamental misinterpretation of how LLMs work. You can’t train an LLM to distinguish reality from fiction because it’s designed to provide the most statistically probable output to a prompt, which is not always the most truthful output — especially in breaking news.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Riverside did a great job making a fun end-of-year product, but it’s also a reminder. AI is infiltrating every industry, including podcasting. But in this moment of the “AI boom,” as companies tinker with new technology, we need to be able to distinguish between when AI serves us, and when it’s fodder for useless <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/merriam-webster-names-slop-the-word-of-the-year/\">slop</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Once that exclusive year is up, Disney is free to sign similar deals with other AI companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal gives OpenAI a high-profile content partner, allowing users to draw on more than 200 characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars to create content on Sora. For now, it’s the only AI platform that’s legally permitted to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Disney, the deal offers a way to test the waters with generative AI and its intellectual property, letting the company assess how its partnership with OpenAI goes before pursuing additional agreements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“No human generation has ever stood in the way of technological advance, and we don’t intend to try,” Iger told CNBC. “We’ve always felt that if it’s going to happen, including disruption of our current business models, then we should get on board.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tellingly, the same day that Disney announced its deal with OpenAI, the company sent a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-hits-google-with-cease-and-desist-claiming-massive-copyright-infringement/\">cease-and-desist letter to Google</a>, alleging that the tech giant has infringed on its copyrights.

Those storage systems, which will use cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries, will be used to power data centers and help buffer demand on the electric grid. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford says the battery storage systems will start shipping in 2027 and that the company plans to build 20GWh of annual capacity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford will invest about $2 billion into the new business over the next two years. Under the plan, Ford will repurpose the existing manufacturing capacity at its Kentucky factory. Ford plans to produce LFP batteries using technology licensed from China’s CATL, as well as battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems at this facility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford will join a number of automakers that are operating in or planning to enter the battery storage space. Tesla has spent the last decade selling battery storage products and deploys around 10GWh every quarter. General Motors also has a set of home and commercial <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/gm-teams-up-with-redwood-materials-to-power-data-centers-with-ev-batteries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">battery storage products</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lisa Drake, vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems at Ford, said the “predominant” opportunity for the new business will be commercial grid customers. But data centers will be secondary, and then Ford expects to offer some home storage products, Drake said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was clear when we went out to the market that the technology of choice for most of these customers was an LFP prismatic type of container system,” Drake said during a call with reporters. “And given the fact that we already had a license to build that technology in the U.S., you couple that with our manufacturing experience over a century of high-scale manufacturing, it just made a lot of sense as a natural adjacency for us.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford’s BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall, which is slated to begin production of LFP batteries in 2026, is still on track, the company said. Those LFP batteries, which also use CATL tech, will be used in Ford’s upcoming mid-sized electric truck. There will be one adjustment at the Michigan factory, however. Ford said it will also be used to make smaller Amp-hour cells for use in “residential energy storage solutions,” suggesting that Ford’s plan will go beyond commercial customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The BlueOval Battery Park Michigan has gone through several iterations in its abbreviated life. In February 2023, Ford said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/13/ford-to-build-3-5b-factory-catl/\">invest $3.5 billion</a> to build the factory to make LFP batteries for its growing portfolio of electric vehicles. Ford abruptly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/25/ford-halts-work-on-3-5b-ev-battery-factory-with-chinas-catl/\">halted construction</a> on the factory in September 2023. Two months later, it announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/21/ford-downsizes-ev-battery-factory-plan/\">dialed-back plan</a> with a production capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours, about 43% smaller than planned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In its place, Ford will sell what’s known as an “extended range electric vehicle” version of the truck, which adds a gas generator that can recharge the battery pack to power the motors for over 700 miles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company did not share when the new F-150 Lightning will go on sale, or how much it will cost. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pivot will come with a substantial price tag for Ford. The company will take a $19.5 billion hit to reshape its EV business strategy. Most of those charges, including an $8.5 billion writedown of its EV assets, will be recorded in the fourth quarter. Ford said $5.5 billion in cash is to be charged through 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shakeup affects numerous factories and workers. It also means Ford’s next-generation all-electric truck — internally dubbed “T3” — is now dead. The T3 was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/ford-to-build-next-gen-ev-truck-at-5-6b-factory-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">supposed to be a clean-sheet design,</a> as opposed to the Lightning, which had electric vehicle technology that was shoehorned into a gas vehicle design. Ford confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s also abandoning <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2025/08/07/ford-delay-ev-electric-full-size-pickup-truck-t3-commercial-van-blueoval-city/85563663007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plans</a> for a next-generation commercial van. The current model, the E-Transit, will continue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,” the company wrote in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is still planning on releasing a mid-sized all-electric pickup truck in 2027, the company confirmed Monday. The platform that powers that truck — born out of a skunkworks program led by former Tesla executives Doug Field and Alan Clarke — will also underpin other future Ford vehicles. Ford said it is still on track to begin producing cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries in 2026. Those LFP batteries, which will be built at the BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall and use technology licensed from China’s CATL, will be used in the mid-sized truck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas, more trucks and van hybrids, extended-range electric vehicles, affordable EVs, and entirely new opportunities like energy storage,” Ford president Andrew Frick said on a call with reporters.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revealed</a> the F-150 Lightning in 2021, two years after it first announced plans for an all-electric Mustang, the Mach-E. Ford teased a $40,000 price tag for the Lightning, which was meant to be a flagship product for the company’s $22 billion push into electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like most large electric trucks, though, the F-150 Lightning struggled in the U.S. market. Part of that was because the $40,000 price tag never materialized for most buyers, as that base trim was targeted specifically at fleet customers. Ford wound up selling <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/gmc-hummer-ev-outsold-the-tesla-cybertruck-last-quarter/\">around 7,000 Lightnings per quarter</a> over the last two years, with a peak of nearly 11,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EVs have faced a lot of headwind since the F-150 Lightning was first introduced. Tesla kicked off a dramatic price war to counter falling sales, which ate into legacy automakers’ thin (or negative) margins. The reelection of Donald Trump, along with Republicans taking control of Congress, has led to a reversal of many Biden-era policies meant to encourage the sale of electric vehicles.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In July, the organization <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2025/06/25/introducing-cc-signals-a-new-social-contract-for-the-age-of-ai/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=introducing-cc-signals-a-new-social-contract-for-the-age-of-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> a plan to provide a legal and technical framework for dataset sharing between companies that control the data and the AI providers that want to train on it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the nonprofit is tentatively backing pay-to-crawl systems, saying it is “cautiously supportive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls,” a CC <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2025/12/12/where-cc-stands-on-pay-to-crawl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post said</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spearheaded by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-launches-a-marketplace-that-lets-websites-charge-ai-bots-for-scraping/\">companies like Cloudflare</a>, the idea behind pay-to-crawl would be to charge AI bots every time they scrape a site to collect its content for model training and updates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past, websites freely allowed web crawlers to index their content for inclusion into search engines like Google. They benefited from this arrangement by seeing their sites listed in search results, which drove visitors and clicks. With AI technology, however, the dynamic has shifted. After a consumer gets their answer via an AI chatbot, they’re unlikely to click through to the source.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This shift has already been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/googles-ai-overviews-are-killing-traffic-for-publishers/\">devastating for publishers</a> by killing search traffic, and it shows no sign of letting up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A pay-to-crawl system, on the other hand, could help publishers recover from the hit AI has had on their bottom line. Plus, it could work better for smaller web publishers that don’t have the pull to negotiate one-off content deals with AI providers. Major deals have been struck between companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/20/openai-signs-deal-to-train-on-conde-nast-content-surface-stories-in-chatgpt/\">OpenAI and Condé Nast</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/openai-inks-deal-with-axel-springer-on-licensing-news-for-model-training/\">Axel Springer</a> and others; as well as between <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407814/gannett-couples-up-with-perplexity-they-sign-cont.html?edition=139351\">Perplexity and Gannett</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/business/media/new-york-times-amazon-ai-licensing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon and The New York Times</a>; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/meta-signs-commercial-ai-data-agreements-with-publishers-to-offer-real-time-news-on-meta-ai/\">Meta and various media publishers</a>, <a href=\"https://futureweek.com/a-complete-list-of-publishers-striking-ai-content-licensing-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">among</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/microsoft-starts-paying-publishers-for-content-in-copilot/\">others</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CC offered several caveats to its support for pay-to-crawl, noting that such systems could concentrate power on the web. It could also potentially block access to content for “researchers, nonprofits, cultural heritage institutions, educators, and other actors working in the public interest.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It suggested a series of principles for responsible pay-to-crawl, including not making pay-to-crawl a default setting for all websites and avoiding blanket rules for the web. In addition, it said that pay-to-crawl systems should allow for throttling, not just blocking, and should preserve public interest access. They should also be open, interoperable, and built with standardized components.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare isn’t the only company investing in the pay-to-crawl space. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft is also building an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/23/microsoft-ai-marketplace-publishers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI marketplace for publishers,</a> and smaller startups like ProRata.ai and TollBit have started to do so, as well. Another group called the RSL Collective <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/rss-co-creator-launches-new-protocol-for-ai-data-licensing/\">announced</a> its own spec for a new standard called Really Simple Licensing (RSL) that would dictate what parts of a website crawlers could access but would stop short of actually blocking the crawlers. <a href=\"https://mediacopilot.ai/rsl-licensing-standard-hits-1-0-gains-support-from-1500-publishers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cloudflare, Akamai,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastly.com/blog/control-and-monetize-your-content-with-the-rsl-standard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fastly</a> have since adopted RSL, which is <a href=\"https://rslstandard.org/press/rsl-1-specification-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">backed</a> by Yahoo, Ziff Davis, O’Reilly Media, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CC was also among those that <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2025/12/10/integrating-choices-in-open-standards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> its support for RSL, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/creative-commons-debuts-cc-signals-a-framework-for-an-open-ai-ecosystem/\">alongside CC signals</a>, its broader project to develop technology and tools for the AI era.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The 25-year-old venture firm announced Monday that it raised a total of <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251215319417/en/Lightspeed-Closes-Over-%249B-in-New-Funds-Aimed-at-Backing-Category-Definers-Worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$9 billion</a> in fresh funds, the largest fundraise in firm’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At a time when very few companies have managed to IPO, Lightspeed was an early investor in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/25/rubriks-shares-climb-20-in-its-public-debut/\">Rubrik</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/netskope-follows-rubrik-as-a-rare-cybersecurity-ipo-both-backed-lightspeed/\">Netskope</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/navan-ipo-tumbles-20-after-historic-debut-under-sec-shutdown-workaround/\">Navan</a>, all of which have recently made their public market debuts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm has also positioned itself as a predominantly AI-focused investor. Lightspeed claims to have backed 165 AI-native companies, including Anthropic, xAI, Databricks, Mistral, Glean, Abridge, and Skild AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Armed with its giant new fund, the firm can continue to make massive investments into capital-intensive AI companies. For instance, Lightspeed reportedly wrote a $1 billion check to Anthropic when it co-led the LLM-maker’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">$13 billion</a> investment in September.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightspeed’s new capital is spread across six funds, including a $3.3 billion opportunity fund dedicated to follow-on investments in its fastest-growing portfolio companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other large VC firms that have recently raised enormous capital pools include Founders Fund, which earlier this year amassed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/founders-funds-new-4-6b-fund-indicates-an-era-of-big-vc-spending/\">$4.6 billion</a> for a growth fund, as well as General Catalyst’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/general-catalyst-raises-8b-in-fresh-funds-to-back-startups-globally/\">$8 billion</a> capital haul and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/andreessen-horowitzs-7-2b-new-funds-for-a-new-era/\">Andreessen Horowitz’s $7.2 billion</a>, both secured in 2024.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, younger and smaller VC firms <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/our-funds-are-20-years-old-a-look-inside-the-liquidity-crisis-reshaping-venture-capital/\">are struggling</a> to attract fresh funds.

Amidst the onslaught of content that has swept the web over the past 12 months, Merriam-Webster announced Sunday that its word of the year for 2025 is “slop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The dictionary<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> defines the term</a> as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like <em>slime</em>, <em>sludge</em>, and <em>muck</em>, <em>slop</em> has the wet sound of something you don’t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything,” the dictionary writes, adding that, in an age of AI anxiety, it is a term designed to communicate “a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking” of the technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster’s president, Greg Barlow, told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The word “slop” has certainly been everywhere this year, as journalists and commentators have sought to describe the ways in which platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">OpenAI’s Sora</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/googles-veo-2-video-generator-comes-to-gemini/\">Google Gemini’s Veo</a> are transforming the internet. Thanks to this new breed of media generator, there are now AI-generated books, podcasts, pop songs, TV commercials — even entire movies. One study in May<a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-percentage-of-new-content-is-ai-generated/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> claimed that</a> nearly 75% of all new web content from the previous month had involved some kind of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These new tools have even led to what has been dubbed a “slop economy,” in which gluts of AI-generated content <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">can be milked for advertising money</a>. Critics <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04755\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">worry that</a> this trend is further polarizing digital communities, dividing them into those who can afford paywalled, higher-quality content, and those who can only afford a digital diet of slop, which — as you might imagine — can be quite light on informational value. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But “slop” has also been used to describe AI’s impact on a large variety of fields that don’t have much to do with traditional media consumption, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/ai-slop-and-fake-reports-are-exhausting-some-security-bug-bounties/\">cybersecurity reports</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/business/lawyers-ai-vigilantes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legal briefings</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/magazine/ai-higher-education-students-teachers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the college essay</a>, among other things. Its impact is broad, to say the least.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relatedly, tech words have been <a href=\"https://time.com/7334730/word-of-the-year-2025-cambridge-collins-dictionary-oxford-merriam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">big winners in the WOTY (word of the year) category</a> this year. Macquarie Dictionary already beat out Merriam-Webster to make “AI slop” its annual term, while Oxford Dictionary chose “ragebait.” Collins Dictionary went with “vibe coding.”   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sur_surly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one commenter</a> put it, it often felt like all users could do was change their passwords without clear guidance on which accounts or websites were affected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re making this change to instead focus on tools that give you more clear, actionable steps to protect your information online,” the tech giant wrote. “We’ll continue to track and defend you from online threats, including the dark web, and build tools that help protect you and your personal information.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In place of the dark web report feature, Google recommended other protective measures. The company offers other tools, such as “Security Checkup,” which reviews your Google account’s security; a built-in “Password Manager” for generating unique passwords; and “Password Checkup,” which sends alerts when your saved passwords have been compromised, among other features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users were alerted via email, according to <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/12/15/google-dark-web-report-shutting-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">9to5Google</a>, which was the first to spot the feature’s planned shutdown.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you were using the dark web report feature, it’s important to note that scanning for new dark web breaches will stop on January 16.

Like many people, I spend a lot of time on calls, and because I’m a journalist, I almost always record them. (With consent, of course!) Audio Hijack makes recording audio from any source a snap, and I can limit what appears on the recording to a specific app — no more reminder dings popping up in the background. I typically send audio from my mic to one channel and that of my source to another. That way if we’re talking over each other, I can isolate one or the other channel to figure out what was said. And with inline transcription and the security of local files, Audio Hijack has pretty much everything I need.

(They’re currently on sale for $274 but retail for $349, the website says.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether you need to mask outside noise, like street sounds, or closer disruptions like a snoring partner or noisy roommate, these earbuds can help light sleepers more easily get through the night without waking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, at this price point, Sleepbuds feel like a luxury — especially given there are more affordable solutions. You could just play music in your room or sleep with your AirPods on, for instance; but neither is ideal. The former won’t mask all the noise and the latter is uncomfortable and even painful. The Sleepbuds, however, offer squishy, soft in-ear earbuds that can stream a variety of built-in sleep sounds or music or audio from your smartphone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if you’re a side sleeper or toss and turn, they don’t fall out, I found. You can also set the Sleepbuds to pause streaming when you fall asleep, which is great if your sleep issues are more around falling asleep than staying asleep. (This can be useful for those who like to doze off to audiobooks too!)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The product has not been perfect, I should warn. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth connection and streaming can be wonky at times and one earbud or the other sometimes doesn’t charge properly, requiring a device reset. Plus, if you’re streaming via Bluetooth, the phone and Sleepbuds case have to be placed in close proximity for the best connection. The provided sleep sounds can load directly onto the buds themselves, which tends to work better. Still, the overall experience of finally being able to quiet the world — comfortably — and get some real sleep made them a worthwhile purchase for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076059\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png 854w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/videoframe_1491.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kidee</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My favorite gadget of 2025 is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL6NL6DS?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3&amp;th=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">neck fan from Kidee</a>.

If it doesn’t change your life, it’ll certainly save you money. Synology and Western Digital are decent places to start. A NAS box isn’t just a glorified internet-connected hard drive that lives in your closet; it doubles as its own self-hosting server that can run your own apps, services, and data at home. You can host your own recipe planner, news tracker, photo gallery, to-do lists, and more.

I place my phone on my nightstand, turn on sleep mode, set my alarm, and then pivot to what I call “Kindle donut time,” since the Kindle stand is kind of shaped like a donut. I get under my heated blanket, grab my remote-control page turner, and read until I can’t keep my eyes open. This is a sacred experience. Long live Kindle donut time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076061\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GUEST_ba99f892-43c5-4d5a-bba3-5e3af76ce86c.webp?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>SpaRoom via Target</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As someone who never really understood the appeal of candle warmers, I was gifted a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.target.com/p/sparoom-candle-lamp-warmer/-/A-94371211?preselect=91287348#lnk=sametab\">SpaRoom</a> this year and ended up really liking it.

In October, he launched a new effort called Russell AI Labs and made <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/ousted-luminar-ceo-austin-russell-wants-to-buy-the-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a bid to buy Luminar outright</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell still plans to bid for what’s left of Luminar during the bankruptcy process, a spokesperson for Russell AI Labs told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Over the past three months — at the invitation of certain key stakeholders including Luminar board members — Russell AI Labs, in partnership with a large technology company, engaged with Luminar on a proposal to provide a landing pad for the company and preserve and create shareholder value. Unfortunately they went in a different direction, as evidenced by today’s events,” the spokesperson said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It has been challenging for Mr. Russell to watch from the sidelines, and Russell AI Labs believes we can create tremendous value with Luminar’s technology platform, restore key customer relationships, progress the mission to save millions of lives, and build the business stronger than ever,” they continued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, meanwhile, cut 25% of its workforce — its second layoff of the year. Luminar’s chief financial officer left the company, the company defaulted on a number of loans, and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar was also hit with <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2025/10/27/luminar-technologies-eviction-lawsuit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an eviction lawsuit</a> in October at one office and it <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2025/11/18/luminar-sunnyvale-lease-cancel-bankruptcy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">exited a lease</a> on another in November.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another big blow came in November when Volvo, an early backer of Luminar and its largest customer heading into this year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/luminar-is-fighting-with-its-biggest-customer-as-bankruptcy-threat-looms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">canceled a five-year-old contract with the lidar-maker</a>. Luminar said it has taken legal action against Volvo over the dissolution, but it has also been hit with its own legal claim from the contract manufacturer that actually made the lidar sensors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar is claiming to have between $100 million and $500 million in assets and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities, according to the bankruptcy filings. Among those liabilities is a $10 million debt owed to Scale AI, which was helping Luminar with data labeling. Luminar also owes more than $1 million to AI software company Applied Intuition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with a statement from Russell AI Labs.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Discovery (WBD) for $82.7 billion. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/how-would-the-netflix-warner-bros-deal-reshape-hollywood/\">Responses from the industry</a> have been generally negative, sparking concern about the acquisition’s implications for jobs, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have sought to address fears surrounding the deal in a letter to employees, which was made public by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-15/netflix-ceos-make-their-case-for-warner-bros-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> on Monday. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The executives reassured staff of their commitment to maintaining theatrical releases for WBD films. They also asserted that there will be “no overlap or studio closures.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The co-CEOs further stated that the “deal is about growth” and that the company is “strengthening one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite these assurances, <a href=\"https://www.wgaeast.org/wga-statement-on-the-acquisition-of-warner-bros-discovery-by-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Writers Guild of America (WGA)</a> has emerged as a vocal opponent of the acquisition, arguing that it violates antitrust laws designed to prevent monopolies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the deal has attracted the attention of lawmakers. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sen-elizabeth-warren-letter-doj-wbd-sale-paramount-1236430180/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">submitted a letter</a> to the Justice Department Antitrust Division expressing their concerns about the potential implications of a massive merger in the entertainment industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The senators argue that, in addition to raising ethical questions, the newly merged media giant would possess “more market power than the current companies to raise consumers’ television costs,” especially at a time when middle-class families are already facing rising prices. Notably, Netflix raised its subscription prices last January.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To counter monopoly concerns, Peters and Sarandos cited Nielsen data in their letter reportedly showing that combining Netflix and WBD would result in a smaller viewership share than YouTube currently holds, or what a competing Paramount-WBD merger would create.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter comes on the heels of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\">Paramount </a>making a competing $108.4 billion offer to acquire WBD, signaling that the competition for media dominance is far from over.

According to Meta’s help <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/www/148968815185634/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">documentation</a>, Messenger for Mac was built with Catalyst, which lets developers bring iPad apps to the Mac. That technology has received criticism for both developers and users — developers cited the extra work required, while users noticed apps’ lack of a native feel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before its Catalyst version, the Mac app was an Electron app that later migrated to a React Native Desktop app, <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@danielbuechele\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according</a> to a former Meta software engineer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Windows, the app <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1fqaxtp/the_facebook_messenger_app_on_ms_store_has_been/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">transitioned</a> to a progressive web app last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The downgrades likely impacted user demand for a standalone Mac app, while the strategy of moving Messenger back to Facebook suggested Meta was attempting to shore up declining usage of its aging flagship social network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This fall, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/meta-to-shut-down-messenger-desktop-apps-for-mac-and-windows/\">warned users that Messenger’s desktop</a> app would be deprecated by year end, and encouraged users to set up a PIN to save their chat history before moving to the web.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People who use Messenger without a Facebook account are being redirected to Messenger.com after the shutdown, where they’ll be able to log in without creating a Facebook account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More information for users about the transition is available on Facebook’s help center, with separate sections for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1789649698300122?helpref=faq_content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mac users</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/804132271957789/?helpref=related_articles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Windows users</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now he is on the precipice of launching a service meant to compete with Waymo, the Alphabet-owned company that he said last week “never really had a chance against Tesla.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The removal of the safety monitors will most likely ramp up the scrutiny on Tesla’s ongoing testing in Austin, doubly so when the company starts offering rides in the empty cars. Tesla’s small test fleet has been involved in at least seven crashes since June; few details are known about the accidents since the company <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/11/17/tesla-robotaxi-had-3-more-crashes-now-7-total/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">aggressively redacts</a> its reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Video of a totally empty Tesla Model Y SUV started spreading on social media over the weekend, and on Sunday, Musk confirmed his company was <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2000302654837371181\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">testing</a> “with no occupants.” Neither Musk nor Tesla has shared how quickly it plans to move to offer customer rides with no safety monitor. The company’s own X account provided a hint in a post Sunday evening: “Slowly, then all at once.” Tesla’s head of AI, Ashok Elluswamy, <a href=\"https://x.com/aelluswamy/status/2000249076567404593\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>: “And so it begins!”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/22/tesla-launches-robotaxi-rides-in-austin-with-big-promises-and-unanswered-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">started offering rides</a> in Austin to hand-picked influencers and customers in June, with an employee in the passenger seat who could take over if the cars did anything unsafe. Those safety monitors moved to the <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/09/03/tesla-moves-robotaxi-safety-monitor-passenger-drivers-seat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">driver’s seat in September</a>. The company has since ditched the wait list, and gradually expanded its service area to cover a large portion of the greater Austin metropolitan area. But its fleet size never grew to more than about 25 to 30 cars by most fans’ counts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk has claimed Tesla will operate its own fleet of Robotaxis, and said in July he <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/07/23/elon-musk-with-straight-face-tesla-robotaxi-will-cover-half-us-population-end-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">believed this fleet</a> would cover “half of the population of the U.S.” by the end of this year. That outrageous target, like so many Musk has set over the years, has been revised down to him claiming in November that Tesla would roughly double its existing Austin fleet, or <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/11/26/elon-musk-slashes-tesla-robotaxi-fleet-goal-austin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">around 60 vehicles</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has been testing a ride-hail service in the San Francisco area for the last few months, in which drivers use the company’s advanced driver assistance software. California has regulations in place that mean Tesla will need to combine multiple permits if it wants to offer fully driverless rides in the state. Texas, on the other hand, does not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk has also talked a lot over the years about allowing Tesla owners to add their personal cars to the company’s robotaxi fleet. In 2016, he even promised that every car Tesla made had all the hardware required to eventually become autonomous. That was wrong, and that blog post has since been removed from Tesla’s website (the company faces a number of legal challenges over it). Tesla has gone through multiple versions of the hardware that powers its driver assistance software, meaning there are millions of cars on the road that, by Musk’s own admission in January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/elon-musk-reveals-elon-musk-was-wrong-about-full-self-driving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">will need to be upgraded</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
