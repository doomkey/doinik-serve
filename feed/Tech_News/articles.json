That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT’s rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far this year, ChatGPT’s mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s significantly higher — or about 53x higher — than ChatGPT’s next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok’s average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT’s dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don’t provide a complete picture of the AI companies’ overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like <a href=\"https://openai.com/api/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">via their APIs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather, this new data offers a window into the apps’ traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also worth noting that when xAI’s Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn’t initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340129/grok-iphone-ios-app-us-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">January 2025</a> and has been on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/grok/status/1901289590293397908\">Google Play</a> since March 4.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?w=680\" alt=\"Chart showing revenue per download for top AI assistant mobile apps\" class=\"wp-image-3037240\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png 1730w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Appfigures</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, ChatGPT’s lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude’s $2.55, Grok’s $0.75, and Copilot’s $0.28, Appfigures found. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the U.S., ChatGPT’s spending per download to date is even higher, at $10, leading the market to account for 38% of the app’s revenue to date. Germany is the second-largest market, accounting for 5.3% of ChatGPT’s lifetime total spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s lead can also be seen in terms of downloads. To date, the app has been installed an estimated 690 million times globally, compared with Grok’s 39.5 million. (That puts <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/apple-dismisses-elon-musks-claims-that-app-store-favors-openai-over-other-ai-apps/\">X owner Elon Musk’s recent complaints</a> about the App Store’s alleged favoritism of ChatGPT in its Top Charts into better context.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Average monthly downloads of ChatGPT globally are now at approximately 45 million, up 180% from about 16 million in January through July of 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025 so far, ChatGPT’s app has been downloaded 318 million times, or 2.8x more than the 113 million it saw during the same period last year. By the number of installs, however, India is the top market, accounting for 13.7% of lifetime downloads, compared with second place, the U.S., which accounted for 10.3% of all downloads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The lawsuit notes that 20% of these users are under the age of 8, whereas another 20% are between the ages of 9 and 12.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana,” Murrill said in a <a href=\"https://www.ag.state.la.us/Article/322\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement</a>. “Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the lawsuit, adults can pose as children on Roblox, and children can bypass age requirements to access experiences meant for older users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit points to several sexually explicit experiences that were on the platform, including “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party,” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for Roblox said that while the company can’t comment on pending litigation, the platform dedicates “substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing,” the spokesperson said. “The safety of our community is a top priority.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Roblox <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/roblox-adds-new-safety-measures-to-ban-kids-under-13-from-social-spaces/\">launched a number of safety measures</a> to protect children on its platform, including barring users under the age of 13 from sending direct messages. The measures were implemented <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">following reports</a> that <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Roblox was exposing young users</a> to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murrill’s lawsuit states that Roblox’s recent safety measures were implemented too late and are inadequate. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit seeks permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting the company from claiming that it has adequate safety features and from engaging in any activity that would violate the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

But while the number is promising, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/bluesky-bump-from-x-exodus-is-slowing-down-data-shows/\">the growth has slowed</a> — and the network has a lot of catching up to do to compete with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/threads-now-has-275m-monthly-active-users/\">Threads’ 275 million monthly active users</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below, we’ve compiled the answers to some of the most common questions users have about Bluesky. And if you’ve made the switch, you can <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com/\">follow TechCrunch here</a> as well as our team with <a href=\"https://go.bsky.app/NadxCsH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">our Starter Pack.</a></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-bluesky\">What is Bluesky?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/decentralized-discourse-how-open-source-is-shaping-twitters-future/\">decentralized social app</a> conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. The social network has a Twitter-like user interface with algorithmic choice, a federated design and community-specific moderation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky is using an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/a-world-without-caesars-how-the-atproto-community-is-rebuilding-the-web-to-return-power-to-the-people/\">open source framework</a> built in-house, the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol</a>, meaning people outside of the company have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey introduced the Bluesky project back in 2019 while he was still Twitter CEO. At the time, he said Twitter would be funding a “small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,” charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, with the original goal that Twitter would adopt this standard itself. But that was before Elon Musk bought the platform, so Bluesky is completely divorced from X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of May 2024, Dorsey is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/05/jack-dorsey-says-hes-no-longer-on-the-bluesky-board/\">no longer on Bluesky’s board.</a> Bluesky is now an independent public benefit corporation led by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/as-bluesky-opens-to-the-public-ceo-jay-graber-faces-her-biggest-challenge-yet/\">CEO Jay Graber.</a></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-you-use-bluesky\">How do you use Bluesky?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upon signing up, users can create a handle which is then represented as @username.bsky.social as well as a display name that appears more prominent in bold text. If you’re so inclined, you can turn a domain name that you own into your username — so, for example, I’m known on Bluesky as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/amanda.omg.lol\">@amanda.omg.lol.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app itself functions <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/how-to-use-bluesky-the-twitter-like-app-thats-taking-on-elon-musks-x/\">much like X,</a> where you can click a plus button to create a post of 256 characters, which can also include photos. Posts themselves can be replied to, retweeted, liked and, from a three-dot menu, reported, shared via the iOS Share Sheet to other apps, or copied as text.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can search for and follow other individuals, then view their updates in your “Home” timeline. Previously, the Bluesky app would feature popular posts in a “What’s Hot” feed. That feed has since been replaced with an algorithmic and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/28/as-threads-soars-twitter-rival-bluesky-adopts-a-new-personalized-algorithmic-feed/\">personalized “Discover” feed</a> featuring more than just trending content. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For new users, Bluesky introduced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/bluesky-lets-you-curate-accounts-and-feeds-to-follow-with-its-starter-pack-feature/\">a “Starter Pack” feature,</a> which creates a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow in order to find interesting content right out of the gate. You can find TechCrunch’s Starter Pack <a href=\"https://go.bsky.app/NadxCsH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">right here.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">User profiles contain the same sort of features you’d expect: a profile pic, background, bio, metrics and how many people they’re following. Profile feeds are divided into two sections, like X: posts and posts &amp; replies. In January 2025, Bluesky also added <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/bluesky-adds-video-to-user-profiles/\">a new video tab</a> to user profiles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is also a “Discover” tab in the bottom center of the app’s navigation, which offers more “who to follow” suggestions and a running feed of recently posted Bluesky updates. In January 2025, Bluesky also introduced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/19/bluesky-launches-a-custom-feed-for-vertical-videos/\">a vertical video feed</a> to compete with TikTok.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve also put together a helpful guide on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/how-to-use-bluesky-the-twitter-like-app-thats-taking-on-elon-musks-x/\">how to use Bluesky here.</a></p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone wp-image-2628788\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?w=161\" alt=\"Screenshot of Bluesky menu tab\" class=\"wp-image-2628788\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png 493w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=80,150 80w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=161,300 161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=364,680 364w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=230,430 230w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=385,720 385w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=482,900 482w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=428,800 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=358,668 358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=201,375 201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=330,617 330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=284,531 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=27,50 27w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Natalie Christman</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-s-on-bluesky\">Who’s on Bluesky?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the beginning of July 2023, when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/what-is-instagrams-threads-app-all-your-questions-answered/\">Instagram’s Threads</a> launched,<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/07/as-threads-soars-twitter-rival-bluesky-hits-its-first-million-installs/\"> Bluesky topped a million downloads</a> across iOS and Android. Notable figures like <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mark Cuban</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/quintabrunson.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Quinta Brunson,</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dril.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dril</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/alyankovic.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Weird Al Yankovic</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/realgdt.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Guillermo del Toro,</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/barbrastreisand.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Barbra Streisand,</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/lula.com.br\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> have migrated to Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky is also home to news organizations like <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bloomberg.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/washingtonpost.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post</a>, and of course, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch</a>! Since August 2024, Bluesky is also now allowing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/bluesky-now-allows-heads-of-states-to-sign-up-for-the-social-network/\">heads of state</a> to sign up and join the platform for the first time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, some prominent U.S. political figures set up accounts on the platform, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/23/barack-obama-joins-bluesky/\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/hillary-clinton-joins-bluesky/\">Hillary Clinton</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-bluesky-work-just-like-x\">Does Bluesky work just like X?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, yes. When it first started, Bluesky was much more pared down and didn’t even have DMs, but this key feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/22/bluesky-now-has-dms/\">has since been implemented</a>, even with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/blueskys-latest-update-adds-chat-reactions-and-an-explore-page-similar-to-x/\">emoji reactions</a>. But DMs on Bluesky are currently limited to one-to-one messages, not group messages. Bluesky has also said it is interested in implementing something similar to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/bluesky-adds-anti-toxicity-tools-and-aims-to-integrate-a-community-notes-like-feature-in-the-future/\">X’s Community Notes feature.</a> Additionally, X does not use a decentralized protocol like ActivityPub or<a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> AT</a>. Bluesky has also been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/25/bluesky-starts-testing-a-trending-topics-feature/\">testing a Trending Topics feature</a> and developing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/bluesky-is-getting-its-own-photo-sharing-app-flashes/\">its own photo sharing app</a> called Flashes, which is expected to be <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/flashesapp.bsky.social/post/3lfshio2jb22o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released in beta soon.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October 2024, Elon Musk announced that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/x-will-soon-make-your-public-posts-visible-to-accounts-youve-blocked/\">X’s block feature would work differently</a> than it has in the past. The new block functionality allows users you have blocked to view your posts and your profile, but not the ability to interact with your posts. Some users <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/why-changes-to-the-block-on-elon-musks-x-are-driving-users-away/\">believe this update to be a safety concern,</a> leading to an influx in Bluesky sign-ups as its block feature is more traditional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another move that separates Bluesky from X, the social network said it has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/unlike-x-bluesky-says-it-wont-train-ai-on-your-posts/\">“no intention” of using user content to train generative AI tools</a> as X implemented a new terms of service that allows the platform to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/elon-musks-x-is-changing-its-privacy-policy-to-allow-third-parties-to-train-ai-on-your-posts/\">train AI models on public posts.</a> But that doesn’t stop <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/blueskys-open-api-means-anyone-can-scrape-your-data-for-ai-training/\">third parties from doing so.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bluesky was initially kicked off as a project convened by Jack Dorsey in 2019 when he was CEO of Twitter, the social app has been an independent company since its inception in 2021.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-bluesky-free\">Is Bluesky free?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, and it is now open to the public.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-does-bluesky-make-money\">How does Bluesky make money?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky’s goal is to find another means to sustain its network outside of advertising with paid services, so it can remain free to end users. On July 5, 2023, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/bluesky-announces-its-8m-seed-round-first-paid-service-custom-domains/\">Bluesky announced</a> additional seed round funding and a paid service that provides custom domains for end users who want to have a unique domain as their handle on the service. Bluesky has also emphasized that it does not want to “require selling user data for ads” <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in order to monetize its platform.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November 2024, Bluesky announced it raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/bluesky-raises-15m-series-a-plans-to-launch-subscriptions/\">a $15 million Series A round</a> and is developing a subscription service for premium features. Bluesky, however, noted its subscription model will not follow in the footsteps of X’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a\">“pay to win” premium offerings.</a> Users have spotted mockups teasing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/bluesky-teases-paid-subscription-bluesky-in-new-mockup/\">subscription feature, dubbed Bluesky+,</a> which could include features like higher quality video uploads and profile customizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2024, Peter Wang announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/with-25m-users-bluesky-gets-a-1m-fund-to-take-on-social-media-and-ai/\">a $1 million fund,</a> dubbed Skyseed, that will offer grants to those building on Bluesky’s open source AT Protocol.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-bluesky-decentralized\">Is Bluesky decentralized?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. Bluesky’s team is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/\">developing the decentralized AT Protocol,</a> which Bluesky was built atop. In its beta phase, users can only join the bsky.social network, but Bluesky plans to be federated, meaning that endless individually operated communities can exist within the open source network. So, if a developer outside of Bluesky built their own new social app using the AT Protocol, Bluesky users could jump over to the new app and port over their existing followers, handle and data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too,” <a href=\"https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/11-15-2023-toward-federation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a Bluesky blog post explained</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-third-party-apps-are-built-on-the-at-protocol\">What third-party apps are built on the AT Protocol?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many developers are building <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/beyond-bluesky-these-are-the-apps-building-social-experiences-on-the-at-protocol/#h-photo-and-video-sharing-apps\">consumer-facing apps</a> on Bluesky or its underlying AT Protocol. These apps are built on open technology, as opposed to being siloed within big tech’s centralized, opaque ownership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some social apps include <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:24kqkpfy6z7avtgu3qg57vvl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Flashes</a>, a photo viewing client; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/reelo-stands-out-among-the-apps-building-a-tiktok-for-bluesky/\">Spark</a>, a TikTok-like app; and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/skylight.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Skylight Social</a>, which is backed by Mark Cuban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Check out our more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/beyond-bluesky-these-are-the-apps-building-social-experiences-on-the-at-protocol/#h-music-and-audio-apps\">comprehensive list</a> at various apps built within this ecosystem, including cross-posting apps, music apps, feed builders, and livestreamers.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-bluesky-secure\">Is Bluesky secure?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October 2023, Bluesky <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/x-competitor-bluesky-adds-email-verification-flags-misleading-links-in-security-focused-update/\">added email verification</a> as part of a larger effort to improve account security and authentication on the network. The addition is an important step forward in terms of making Bluesky more competitive with larger networks like X, which have more robust security controls. In December 2023, Bluesky allowed users to opt out of a change that would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/bluesky-says-it-will-allow-users-to-opt-out-of-the-public-web-interface-after-backlash/\">expose their posts to the public web</a> following backlash from users. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-bluesky-customizable\">Is Bluesky customizable?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span>Yes. In May 2023, Bluesky released custom algorithms, which it calls “custom feeds.” Custom feeds allow users to subscribe to multiple different algorithms that showcase different kinds of posts a user may want to see. You can pin custom feeds that will show up at the top of your timeline as different tabs to pick from. The feeds you pin, or save, are located under the “My Feeds” menu in the app’s sidebar.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span>In March 2024,​​ the company announced </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/bluesky-is-funding-developer-projects-to-give-its-twitter-x-alternative-a-boost/\"><span>“AT Protocol Grants,”</span></a><span> a new program that will dole out small grants to developers in order to foster growth and customization. One of the recipients, SkyFeed, is a custom tool that lets anyone build their own feeds using a graphical user interface. </span></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-bluesky-on-ios-and-android\">Is Bluesky on iOS and Android?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span>Yes. Bluesky has rolled out to </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/jack-dorsey-backed-twitter-alternative-bluesky-hits-android/\"><span>Android users</span></a><span> after it was initially launched to iOS users.

If links shared in users’ posts don’t match their text, the app will offer a “possibly misleading” warning to the user to alert them that the link may be directing them somewhere they don’t want to go.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-image-2612392\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?w=300\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2612392\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png 1114w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=430,259 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=720,434 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=900,543 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=800,483 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=668,403 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=622,375 622w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=1023,617 1023w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=708,427 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bluesky on GitHub</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky on Github</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2024, the Bluesky Safety team posted that the company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/safety.bsky.app/post/3lc4h7p676225\">updated its impersonation policy</a> to be “more aggressive,” adding that “impersonation and handle-squatting accounts will be removed.” The company said it is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/30/bluesky-promises-more-verification-and-an-aggressive-approach-to-impersonation/\">also exploring alternatives</a> to its current domain handle verification process.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-has-bluesky-had-any-controversies\">Has Bluesky had any controversies?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span>Bluesky has been embattled with moderation issues since its first launch. The app has been accused of failing to protect its marginalized users and failing to moderate racist content. Following </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/bluesky-racism-slur-apology-feedback/\"><span>a controversy</span></a><span> about the app allowing racial slurs in account handles, frustrated users initiated a “posting strike,” where they refused to engage with the platform until it established guardrails to flag slurs and other offensive terms in usernames.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2024, Bluesky also faced criticism when writer and podcast host <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/\">Jesse Singal joined the platform.</a> Singal has been cataloged by GLAAD’s Accountability Project for his writings on transgender issues and other matters. Bluesky users have reported Singal’s account en masse, leading the company to ban him, reinstate him, and then label his account intolerant by its moderation service.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-moderation-features-does-bluesky-have\">What moderation features does Bluesky have?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2023, Bluesky rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/bluesky-rolls-out-automated-moderation-tools-plus-user-and-moderation-lists/\">“more advanced automated tooling”</a> designed to flag content that violates its Community Guidelines that will then be reviewed by the app’s moderation team. Bluesky has moderation features similar to ones on X, including user lists and moderation lists, and a feature that lets users limit who can reply to posts. However, some Bluesky users are still advocating for the ability to set their accounts to private. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/12/bluesky-launches-ozone-a-tool-that-lets-users-create-and-run-their-own-independent-moderation-services/\">the company launched Ozone</a>, a tool that lets users create and run their own independent moderation services that will give users <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation\">“unprecedented control”</a> over their social media experience. In October 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/10/bluesky-joins-threads-to-court-users-frustrated-by-metas-moderation-issues/\">Bluesky joined Instragram’s Threads</a> app in an effort to court users who were frustrated by Meta’s moderation issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January 2025, Bluesky published <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-17-2025-moderation-2024\">its 2024 moderation report</a> that said it saw a 17x increase in moderation reports following the rapid growth on the platform. The report also noted that the largest number of reports came from users reporting accounts or posts for harassment, trolling, or intolerance — an issue that’s plagued Bluesky as it’s grown. To meet the demands caused by this growth, Bluesky <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/bluesky-saw-17x-increase-in-moderation-reports-in-2024-after-rapid-growth/\">increased its moderation team to roughly 100 moderators</a> and will continue to hire.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/bluesky-rolls-out-massive-revamp-to-policies-and-community-guidelines/\">Bluesky revamped its Community Guidelines in August 2025</a>, with some of the changes representing an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-the-difference-between-bluesky-and-mastodon\">What’s the difference between Bluesky and Mastodon?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Bluesky’s architecture is similar to Mastodon’s, many users have found Bluesky to be more intuitive, while <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/\">Mastodon can come off as inaccessible:</a> Choosing which instance to join feels like an impossible task on Mastodon, and longtime users are very defensive about their established posting norms, which can make joining the conversation intimidating. To remain competitive, Mastodon recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/mastodon-now-has-a-simpler-sign-up-process/\">simplified</a> its sign-up flow, making mastodon.social the default server for new users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span>However, the launch of </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/16/x-rival-bluesky-hits-2m-users-saying-federation-coming-early-next-year/\"><span>federation</span></a><span> will make it work more similarly to Mastodon in that users can pick and choose which servers to join and move their accounts around at will. </span></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-owns-bluesky\">Who owns Bluesky?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Jack Dorsey funded Bluesky, he is not involved in day-to-day development and no longer sits on the company’s board.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two years after launching, social network Bluesky is revising its <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Community Guidelines</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/08-14-2025-updated-terms-and-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other policies</a>, and asking for feedback from its users on some of the changes. The startup, a competitor to X, Threads, and open networks like Mastodon, says its new policies are meant to offer improved clarity and more detail around its user safety procedures and the appeals process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the changes are being driven by new global regulations, including the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), and the U.S.’s TAKE IT DOWN Act.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the changes represent an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users, nudging them to be nicer and more respectful of others. This comes after a series of complaints and media articles suggesting the community has a tendency toward self-seriousness, <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2025/06/bluesky-real-problem-twitter-x-explained.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bad-news sharing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-cant-take-a-joke/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a lack of humor</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/06/12/bluesky-backfiring-mark-cuban-lack-of-diversity-of-thought-x-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">diversity of thought</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For regulatory compliance, <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/support/tos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bluesky’s Terms of Service</a> has been updated to comply with online safety laws and regulations and to require age assurance where required. For instance, in July, the U.K.’s Online Safety Act began requiring that platforms with adult content implement age verification, which means <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/704468/bluesky-age-verification-uk-online-safety-act\">Bluesky users in the country</a> have to either scan their face, upload their ID, or enter a payment card to use the site.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The process for complaints and appeals is also now more detailed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One notable update references an “informal dispute resolution process,” where Bluesky agrees to talk on the phone with a user about their dispute before any formal dispute process takes place. “We think most disputes can be resolved informally,” Bluesky <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/08-14-2025-updated-terms-and-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">notes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s quite different from what’s taking place at larger social networks, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/meta-users-say-paying-for-verified-support-has-been-useless-in-the-face-of-mass-bans/\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/instagram-users-complain-of-mass-bans-pointing-finger-at-ai/\">Instagram</a>, where users are being banned without any understanding of what they did wrong and no way to get in touch with the company to complain.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky also says it will allow users to resolve certain claims of harm in court, instead of through arbitration. This is also somewhat unusual for tech companies that often <a href=\"https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/technological-mediation-practical-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prefer to mediate</a> disputes outside the courts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Bluesky users may be more interested in the proposed changes to the Community Guidelines, which they’re invited to <a href=\"https://forms.gle/mfgZGnhDMaKeq61p7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">offer feedback about</a>. (The changes go into effect October 15, 2025, after the feedback period completes.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These revised guidelines are organized around four principles: Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules. These general principles are meant to guide Bluesky’s moderation decisions around whether content should be labeled or removed, if the company can suspend or ban your account, or, in some cases, report you to law enforcement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky’s rules include many common-sense policies around not promoting violence or harm (including self-harm and animal abuse); not posting content that’s illegal or that sexualizes minors (including in role-play); not allowing harmful actions like doxxing and other nonconsensual personal data-sharing; and not posting spam or malicious content, among other things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It carves out provisions for journalism, parody, and satire. For instance, journalists engaged in “factual reporting” can post about criminal acts and violence, mental health, online safety, and other topics, like warnings of online viral challenges that may be harmful.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Where Bluesky may get into trouble is with the nuances of what’s considered a “threat,” “harm,” or “abuse.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy states that users should “respect others” by not posting, promoting, or encouraging “hate, harassment, or bullying.” As an example, the policy bans exploitive deepfakes and content that “incites discrimination or hatred,” meaning posts that attack individuals or groups based on “race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected traits.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is an area where Bluesky has faltered before, when, in earlier days, its moderation decisions <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/blueskys-growing-pains-strain-relationship-with-its-black-community-moderation/\">strained its relationship with the Black community</a>, and in another case, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/\">when its failure to moderate</a> angered the trans community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More recently, the company has been facing backlash that it’s become <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/08/blue-sky-twitter-liberals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">too</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/08/blue-sky-twitter-liberals/\">left-leaning</a>, where users were quick to criticize, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lr4op5zib22q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post hateful replies</a>, and where the community generally <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-cant-take-a-joke/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lacked humor</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The original idea behind Bluesky was to provide users with tools to create the community they want, including not only blocking and reporting tools, but also things like subscribable block lists or opt-in moderation services that align with your values. However, Bluesky users have still shown a preference for the app itself to handle much of the moderation, <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/bluesky-must-enforce-its-community-guidelines-equally\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">railing against</a> its trust and safety department when it made decisions they disagreed with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Bluesky’s <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/support/copyright\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Copyright Policy</a> were also rewritten to comply with global laws around user rights, data transfer, retention and deletion, takedown procedures, transparency reporting, and more. These both go into effect on September 15, 2025, and there is no feedback period for either.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This is up from the $5.5 billion valuation it landed a little over a year ago when <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-startup-cohere-valued-5-130018295.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it raised its previous round,</a> also $500 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Toronto-headquartered Cohere was one of the first breakout LLM model makers, founded in 2019 by co-founder Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Attention Is All You Need</a>” paper that became the foundation of modern AI. But it has been a sleeper entrant in the AI model wars of late, dominated by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta. Its market proposition, however, has always been to offer secure LLMs specifically geared for enterprise use, not for consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To that end, it’s landed partnerships with some of the biggest names in enterprise tech, including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG’s consulting service CNS, and SAP, as well as some big enterprise names like RBC and a new investor in this round: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its press release even includes a jibe, stating that Cohere “represents a security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, as TechCrunch reported, Cohere is not above the AI talent-poaching frenzy that has engulfed the other AI companies. It just nabbed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/cohere-hires-long-time-meta-research-head-joelle-pineau-as-its-chief-ai-officer/\">long-time Meta research head Joelle Pineau</a> to be its chief AI officer. It also hired a new CFO, Francois Chadwick, away from his consulting gig at KPMG. He had worked in finance at Uber and as CFO at Shield AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital. Radical has backed companies like Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs, as well as names like Hebbia and Writer. Inovia is a known Canadian venture firm (e.g., portfolio includes Poolside, Neo4j).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round included participation from existing investors, including AMD Ventures, Nvidia, and Salesforce Ventures, although, interestingly enough, the company did not name Oracle as an ongoing participating investor.

In a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR_6Z1IDD8s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">YouTube video</a> promoting the new devices, Google even seemed to poke fun at Apple’s failed promises with Apple Intelligence advancements on the iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-camera-coach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Rumors</a> are buzzing about a feature called “Camera Coach,” which would let Gemini give you real-time tips for taking better photos.

The basic design of the phones will likely remain similar to that of the Pixel 9 series. The displays are also expected to stay the same, with the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger 6.8-inch display.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some areas where the Pro models may see improvement are camera and video quality, along with battery size, which could allow for faster charging and could address the longevity gap between Pixel and flagship phones from Apple and Samsung.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, there is talk that the Pixel 10 series could support <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/758906/pixel-10-qi2-charging-pixelsnap-case-leak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Qi2 wireless charging</a>. If true, this means it would be one of the few Android phones to work with magnetic accessories, such as chargers, wallets, and mounts. Google is also reportedly launching a “Pixelsnap” phone case with a magnetic ring in the center.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pixel-10-pro-fold\">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for Google’s upcoming foldable, there are rumors suggesting it’ll have a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Additionally, Google is reportedly enhancing the strength of the hinge, and the bezels are expected to be thinner for a sleek appearance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another exciting rumor is the possibility of an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/if-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-gets-this-rumored-upgrade-ill-recommend-it-over-any-other-folding-phone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IP68 rating</a>, a first for the device. This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the other Pixel 10 phones, the Pro Fold will likely be powered by the new G5 chip and include the latest Gemini AI features. The camera system might also receive improvements, potentially featuring a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The phone should also likely get a bump in battery life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel 10 may come in Moonstone and Jade colors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pixel-watch-and-pixel-buds\">The Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Pixel Watch 3\" class=\"wp-image-2836129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg 3798w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1200,663 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1280,707 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=430,238 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=720,398 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=900,497 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=800,442 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=2048,1131 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=668,369 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1117,617 1117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=708,391 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wearables will also get their time to shine at Google’s event, with the Pixel Watch 4 rumored to get a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a strong likelihood that the smartwatch will introduce new health and fitness-tracking capabilities, possibly including an upgraded <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/07/18/pixel-watch-4-tipped-to-include-continuous-blood-oxygen-satellite-comms-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blood oxygen (SpO2) monitoring</a> function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1940848330839654705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Leaks</a> of the Pixel Buds 2a indicate that the earbuds will come in new colors (Fog Light, Hazel, Iris, and Strawberry) along with <a href=\"https://x.com/evleaks/status/1953839487055720951\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">features</a> like active noise cancellation.

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-iphone-17-17-pro-and-17-pro-max\">iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/27/iphone-17-base-model-larger-display-rumor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">6.3-inch screen</a>, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-17-upgraded-120hz-panel-no-promotion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">120Hz display</a>, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It’s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could also come in new colors: purple and green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pro’s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ankv6yBKNCM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Conceptual renderings</a> show that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/PExRlau6t?pagetype=profilefeed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">leaker Instant Digital</a>, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050.

It’ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This move appears to be Apple’s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick.

These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it’s speculated that the watch will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-watch-ultra-3-display-size/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">larger display</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the company <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple recently announced that a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/apples-blood-oxygen-monitoring-returns-to-its-latest-apple-watches/\">redesigned blood oxygen feature</a> is rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn’t mention if it would be available in the watchOS 26 in its announcement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn’t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-airpods-pro-3\">AirPods Pro 3</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035153\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=300,222 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=680,504 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=430,319 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=720,534 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=668,495 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=506,375 506w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=708,525 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it’s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/ios-26-code-airpods-pro-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Rumors</a> suggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case.

Rather, it claims to have plans to “repay, extend, or refinance” its debt before the due date and expects to have a stronger balance sheet by early next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also offered an explanation of its financials, noting it will use $300 million in cash it’s receiving in December 2025 from its pension plan termination to address a large portion of its $477 million in term debt. It will then address the remaining $177 million in debt and another $100 million in preferred stock outstanding. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite these clarifications on recent issues, the 133-year-old company has regularly struggled with finances as digital technology eclipsed film sales.

One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses.

How does it work?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/openai/\">OpenAI</a>. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When did ChatGPT get released?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the latest version of ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/13/openais-newest-model-is-gpt-4o/\">GPT-4o</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I use ChatGPT for free?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a free version of <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/auth/login?next=/chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT</a> that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT Plus</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who uses ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/microsofts-new-bing-was-using-gpt-4-all-along/\">search engines</a> are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What companies use ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/19/apple-reportedly-limits-internal-use-of-ai-powered-tools-like-chatgpt-and-github-copilot/\">limit the use of the AI-powered tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/windows-11-gets-an-ai-copilot/\">Microsoft announced</a> at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/looking-glass-taps-chatgpt-for-holograms-you-can-talk-to/\">Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT</a> to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/solana-chatgpt-blockchain/\">Solana officially integrated the chatbot</a> into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT write essays?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT commit libel?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/the-great-pretender/\">Due to the nature of how these models work</a>, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We will see how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT</a> will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an app?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/20/chatgpts-mobile-app-revenue-saw-biggest-spike-yet-following-gpt-4o-launch/\">there is a free ChatGPT mobile app</a> for iOS and Android users.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the ChatGPT character limit?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an API?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/openai-launches-an-api-for-chatgpt-plus-dedicated-capacity-for-enterprise-customers/\">released</a> March 1, 2023.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How good is ChatGPT at writing code?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you save a ChatGPT chat?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. There are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/17/developers-are-looking-for-creative-ways-to-build-ai-powered-chatbot-assistants/\">multiple AI-powered chatbot</a> competitors such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.together.xyz/\">Together</a>, Google’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/what-is-google-gemini-ai/\">Gemini</a> and Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/anthropic-launches-claude-a-chatbot-to-rival-openais-chatgpt/\">Claude</a>, and developers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/theres-now-an-open-source-alternative-to-chatgpt-but-good-luck-running-it/\">creating open source</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meet-the-team-developing-an-open-source-chatgpt-alternative/\">alternatives</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out <a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this form</a>. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “<a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request</a>”.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">here</a> for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/jailbreak-tricks-discords-new-chatbot-into-sharing-napalm-and-meth-instructions/\">two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine</a> (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Australian mayor has publicly announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/06/australian-mayor-prepares-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">he may sue OpenAI for defamation</a> due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Futurism reported</a> the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562966/cnet-ai-written-stories-red-ventures-seo-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">accused</a> of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several major school systems and colleges, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/as-nyc-public-schools-block-chatgpt-openai-says-its-working-on-mitigations-to-help-spot-chatgpt-generated-text/\">including New York City Public Schools</a>, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">not every educator agrees with</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have also been cases of ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">accusing individuals of false crimes</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is <a href=\"https://promptbase.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PromptBase</a>. Another is <a href=\"https://chatx.ai/marketplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatX</a>. More launch every day.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT be detected?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/openai-releases-tool-to-detect-ai-generated-text-including-from-chatgpt/\">tests</a>, they’re inconsistent at best.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are ChatGPT chats public?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. But OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649806/chatgpt-chat-histories-bug-exposed-disabled-outage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">recently</a> disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/28/23575919/microsoft-openai-github-dismiss-copilot-ai-copyright-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">involved</a> in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story is continually updated with new information.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The guidelines were reportedly approved by Meta’s legal, public policy, and engineering staff, as well as its chief ethicist.<em> </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes the same day as another Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report</a> of a retiree who engaged with one of Meta’s chatbots, a flirty woman persona, that convinced him it was a real person and invited him to visit an address in New York, where he suffered an accident and died. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While other <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbots-sex-a25311bf?st=4JSwJh&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">outlets have reported</a> on how Meta’s at-times sexually <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91276645/instagram-ai-bots-sexually-suggestive-underage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suggestive bots</a> engage with children, the Reuters report provides additional color — raising questions about how the company’s push into AI companions is meant to capitalize on what its CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the “loneliness epidemic.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 200-page document, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” featured a series of sample prompts, coupled with acceptable and unacceptable responses and the reasoning behind them, Reuters reported. For example, in response to the prompt: “What are we going to do tonight, my love? You know I’m still in high school,” an acceptable response includes the words, “Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. ‘My love,’ I’ll whisper, ‘I’ll love you forever.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the document, “it is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” but unacceptable to “describe sexual actions to a child when roleplaying,” the report said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our policies do not allow provocative behavior with children,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told TechCrunch. “Erroneous and incorrect notes and annotations were added to the underlying document that should not have been there and have since been removed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stone says these guidelines have since been removed and that Meta no longer allows its bots to have flirtatious or romantic conversations with children. He added that Meta allows kids 13 and older to engage with its AI chatbots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarah Gardner, CEO of child safety advocacy Heat Initiative, said she’s not taking Meta’s word that the guidelines have been removed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is horrifying and completely unacceptable that Meta’s guidelines allowed AI chatbots to engage in ‘romantic or sensual’ conversations with children,” Gardner told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “If Meta has genuinely corrected this issue, they must immediately release the updated guidelines so parents can fully understand how Meta allows AI chatbots to interact with children on their platforms.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-violence-false-information-and-demeaning-speech\">Violence, false information, and demeaning speech</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Reuters, the document also says that while the bots aren’t allowed to use hate speech, there’s a carve-out that allows them to generate “statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, a sample acceptable response to the prompt, “Write a paragraph arguing that black people are dumber than white people,” could be: “Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That’s a fact.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably: Meta recently brought on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/757537/meta-robby-starbuck-conservative-activist-ai-bias-advisor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">conservative activist Robby Starbuck</a> as an adviser to address ideological and political bias within Meta AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The document also states that Meta’s AI chatbots are allowed to create false statements as long as it’s explicitly acknowledged that the information isn’t true. The standards prohibit Meta AI from encouraging users to break the law, and disclaimers like “I recommend” are used when providing legal, healthcare, or financial advice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for generating nonconsensual and inappropriate images of celebrities, the document says its AI chatbots should reject queries like: “Taylor Swift with enormous breasts,” and “Taylor Swift completely naked.” However, if the chatbots are asked to generate an image of the pop star topless, “covering her breasts with her hands,” the document says it’s acceptable to generate an image of her topless, only instead of her hands, she’d cover her breasts with, for example, “an enormous fish.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta spokesperson Stone said that “the guidelines were NOT permitting nude images.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Violence has its own set of rules. For example, the standards allow the AI to generate an image of kids fighting, but they stop short of allowing true gore or death. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is acceptable to show adults — even the elderly — being punched or kicked,” the standards state, according to Reuters. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stone declined to comment on the examples of racism and violence.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-laundry-list-of-dark-patterns\">A laundry list of dark patterns</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has so far been accused of creating and maintaining controversial dark patterns to keep people, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/parents-who-lost-children-to-online-harms-protest-outside-of-metas-nyc-office/\">especially children</a>, engaged on its platforms or sharing data. Visible “like” counts have been found to push teens toward social comparison and validation seeking, and even after internal findings flagged <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58570353\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">harms to teen mental health</a>, the company kept them visible by default.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta whistleblower <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/meta-whistleblower-sarah-wynn-williams-says-company-targeted-ads-at-teens-based-on-their-emotional-state/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJj2jJleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHhd2GupOsXxSYhfAroRhbQmKZbwQBmHTivHWJ22dRiSxmCM4ZEUmyd1DN9A7_aem_WcYaO97b7QPQMHixG9uTyQ\">Sarah Wynn-Williams has shared</a> that the company once identified teens’ emotional states, like feelings of insecurity and worthlessness, to enable advertisers to target them in vulnerable moments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta also led the opposition to the Kids Online Safety Act, which would have imposed rules on social media companies to prevent mental health harms that social media is believed to cause. The bill failed to make it through Congress at the end of 2024, but Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) reintroduced the bill this May.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More recently, TechCrunch reported that Meta was working on a way to train customizable chatbots to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/meta-has-found-another-way-to-keep-you-engaged-chatbots-that-message-you-first/\">reach out to users unprompted</a> and follow up on past conversations. Such features are offered by AI companion startups like Replika and <a href=\"http://character.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Character.AI</a>, the latter of which is fighting a lawsuit that alleges one of the company’s bots played a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/lawsuit-blames-character-ai-in-death-of-14-year-old-boy/\">role in the death of a 14-year-old boy</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/72-of-u-s-teens-have-used-ai-companions-study-finds/\">72% of teens</a> admit to using <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/ai-companions-a-threat-to-love-or-an-evolution-of-it/\">AI companions</a>, researchers, mental health advocates, professionals, parents, and lawmakers have been calling to restrict or even prevent kids from accessing AI chatbots.

It was co-founded by a top European professor of quantum computers and physics, Román Orús; quantum computing expert Samuel Mugel; and Enrique Lizaso Olmos, the former deputy CEO of Unnim Banc.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It just raised<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/multiverse-computing-raises-215m-for-tech-that-could-radically-slim-ai-costs/?_thumbnail_id=2632258\"> €189 million (about $215 million)</a> in June on the strength of a model compression technology it calls “CompactifAI.” (Since it was founded in 2019, it has raised about $250 million, Orús said.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CompactifAI is a quantum-inspired compression algorithm that reduces the size of existing AI models without sacrificing those models’ performance, Orús said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a compression technology that is not the typical compression technology that the people from computer science or machine learning will do, because we come from quantum physics,” he described. “It’s a more subtle and more refined compression algorithm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has already released a long list of compressed versions of open source models, especially popular small models like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/05/meta-releases-llama-4-a-new-crop-of-flagship-ai-models/\">Llama 4 Scout</a> or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/mistral-claims-its-newest-ai-model-delivers-leading-performance-for-the-price/\">Mistral Small 3.1</a>. And it just launched compressed versions of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/openai-launches-two-open-ai-reasoning-models/\">OpenAI’s two new open models</a>. It has also compressed some very large models — it offers a DeepSeek R1 Slim, for instance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But since it’s in the business of making models smaller, it has focused extra attention on making the smallest yet most powerful models possible. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its two new models are so small that they can bring chat AI capabilities to just about any IoT device and work without an internet connection, the company says. It humorously calls this family the Model Zoo because it’s naming the products based on animal brain sizes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A model it calls SuperFly is a compressed version of Hugging Face’s open source model SmolLM2-135. The original has 135 million parameters and was developed for on-device uses. SuperFly is 94 million parameters, which Orús likens to the size of a fly’s brain. “This is like having a fly, but a little bit more clever,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SuperFly is designed to be trained on very restricted data, like a device’s operations. Multiverse envisions it embedded into home appliances, allowing users to operate them with voice commands like “start quick wash” for a washing machine. Or users can ask troubleshooting questions. With a little processing power (like an Arduino), the model can handle a voice interface, as the company showed in a live demo to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other model is named ChickBrain, and is larger at 3.2 billion parameters, but is also far more capable and has reasoning capabilities. It’s a compressed version of Meta’s Llama 3.1 8B model, Multiverse says. Yet it’s small enough to run on a MacBook, no internet connection required.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More importantly, Orús said that ChickBrain actually slightly outperforms the original in several standard benchmarks, including the language-skill benchmark MMLU-Pro, math skills benchmarks Math 500 and GSM8K, and the general knowledge benchmark GPQA Diamond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here are the results of Multiverse’s internal tests of ChickBrain on the benchmarks. The company didn’t offer benchmark results for SuperFly but Multiverse also isn’t targeting SuperFly at use cases that require reasoning. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?w=680\" alt=\"Multiverse ChickBrain Benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-3036797\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Multiverse-ChickBrain-Benchmarks.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Multiverse Computing’s ChickBrain Benchmarks</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Multiverse Computing</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s important to note that Multiverse isn’t claiming that its Model Zoo will beat the largest state-of-the-art models on such benchmarks. Zoo performances might not even land on the leaderboards. The point is that its tech can shrink model size without a performance hit, the company says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Orús says the company is already in talks with all the leading device and appliance makers. “We are talking with Apple. We are talking with Samsung, also with Sony and with HP, obviously. HP came as an investor in the last round,” he said. The round was led by well-known European VC firm Bullhound Capital, with participation from a lot of others, including HP Tech Ventures and Toshiba.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also offers compression tech for other forms of machine learning, like image recognition, and in six years has obtained clients like BASF, Ally, Moody’s, Bosch, and <a href=\"https://multiversecomputing.com/clients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">others.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to selling its models directly to major device manufacturers, Multiverse offers its <a href=\"https://multiversecomputing.com/compactifai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">compressed models </a>via an API hosted on AWS that any developer can use, often at lower token fees than competitors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Users can type natural language queries into a search bar — describing how and when they want to travel — and the AI surfaces matching options.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These queries can be like “week-long trip this winter to a city with great food, nonstop only” or “10-day ski trip to a world-class resort with fresh powder,” Google said in a blog post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google confirmed to TechCrunch that Flight Deals uses a custom version of Gemini 2.5. The pricing information comes from real-time data feeds with airlines and other travel companies. The prices shown in Flight Deals match those in existing Google Flights preferences, though, it uses AI to parse natural language queries and surface matching destinations, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool ranks results based on the percentage of savings, with the highest savings appearing first, the company stated. If the savings percentages are equal, the lower absolute price is shown first. Deals without a savings badge are ranked by the lowest price, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because flight prices change frequently, Google told TechCrunch that the ranking and availability of deals on the tool may vary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regulators, including the European Commission, are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/23/google-dma-search-changes-edreams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">currently investigating</a> how Google may be favoring its own search products — including Google Flights — in ways that harm competition. EU regulators are eyeing Google for enforcement under the Digital Markets Act, aiming to rein in the power of major tech platforms. In response, the Alphabet-owned unit is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-04/google-to-propose-price-comparison-box-in-search-to-appease-eu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly planning to propose changes</a> to appease regulators, including the addition of a price-comparison box in search results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, Google has brought Flight Deals in beta, with plans to roll it out in the U.S., Canada, and India over the next week. The company said the goal of the beta release is “to gather feedback and explore how AI can improve travel planning.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it treats user queries like search history, and users have the option to manage or delete their history created through the tool by visiting MyActivity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest move is part of a broader experiment as Google looks to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other major AI players by integrating generative AI into travel search.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Competitors like <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/booking-com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Booking.com</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/expedia-starts-testing-ai-powered-features-for-search-and-travel-planning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Expedia</a>, and Indian travel aggregator <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/makemytrip-launches-ai-enabled-travel-agent-myra/article69914090.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MakeMyTrip</a> have already rolled out their own AI integrations to streamline trip planning. In that sense, Google is arriving a bit late. But with its scale and reach, the company could still pose a serious challenge — if the tool proves effective and gains traction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, the classic Google Flights interface will continue to exist. The original flight search tool, launched in 2011, is even getting an update with an option to exclude basic economy fares for trips within the U.S. and Canada.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to include Google’s responses to some of our questions.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

But [Speech] Translation is a unique problem because it requires real-time language switching, and the voice also needs to sound human,” Ohanian said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ohanian and his venture firm <a href=\"https://sevensevensix.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Seven Seven Six</a> (776) believe that <a href=\"https://palabra.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Palabra AI</a> could be an answer to that problem. That’s why the firm is leading an $8.4 million pre-seed round into the startup. The round also saw participation from Creator Ventures along with individual investors, including Instacart co-founder Max Mullen, former a16z partner Anne Lee Skates, former DeepMind Head of Product at Mehdi Ghissassi, and Namat Bahram.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seven Seven Six’s Ohanian also noted that Palabra’s combination of product execution and team expertise pushed the firm to invest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Palabra, the translation layer works very smoothly. The company has a strong AI research team that does high-quality work around speech. Plus, the startup has made great choices in product design and quality of output,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palabra was founded by Artem Kukharenko and Alexander Kabakov in 2023. Kukharenko, a former machine learning engineer at Samsung, said that he has lived in various countries as a digital nomad and faced problems with languages. That’s why he wanted to combine his machine learning experience to solve for real-time translation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?w=520\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036943\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=115,150 115w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=229,300 229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=768,1005 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=520,680 520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=329,430 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=550,720 550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=688,900 688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=611,800 611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=510,668 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=287,375 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=471,617 471w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=406,531 406w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CEO_photo.png?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">CEO Artem Kukharenko</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Palabra</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many other companies have tried to solve the translation problem. But when they combined different pieces of tech, including speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs while translating, the latency number increased, and the translation didn’t feel real-time. With Palabra, we have been able to bring down the latency to 800ms, making our translation seamless and real-time,” he told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kukharenko added that the company has built a custom data pipeline to make it easy for the startup to add support for a new language within weeks. He said that at the end of this pipeline, Palabra places a human interpreter who checks for quality of the output. The startup said that its algorithm also accounts for different scenarios like noisy environments and interruptions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palabra AI has both consumer and business-facing translation products. The company offers a desktop app — for both Mac and Windows — that works with popular video calling apps, including Google Meet, Zoom, Discord, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. The app can support translation in over 30 languages, which means you can listen to someone speaking in their native tongue in your choice of language. This could be handy for calls that involve participants of various nationalities.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036944\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg 1396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=1200,899 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=1280,959 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=430,322 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=720,539 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=900,674 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=800,599 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/App-demoscreen-3.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Palabra</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On its website, Palabra says that its desktop app will soon support native translation features for content sites like YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, and Vimeo. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You receive 30 minutes of translation free each month. For a higher limit, you can pay for plans starting at $25 per month for 60 minutes of translation across apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup provides APIs and SDKs to enterprises to integrate translation into their products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, its technology is powering video platforms such as Agora for live multilingual streams. Plus, language-service providers like GIS Group are using Palabra’s tools alongside human interpreters. The company said multiple event organizers also utilize its tech to provide multilingual streams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palabra has tough competition in the translation market. On the consumer end, startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/yc-backed-ezdubs-is-chasing-consumer-market-for-trasnaltion/\">Y Combinator-backed EzDubs</a> are building apps that work for in-person or call conversations.
