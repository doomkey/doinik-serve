As the density and speed of the ions rises, they begin to collide and fuse, releasing energy in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Getting to really high voltages is the key thing,” Langtry, Avalanche’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. And given that the company is building small reactors — targeting anywhere from 5 kilowatts to several hundred kilowatts — the density of that voltage, 6 million volts per meter, is important. “That’s the real unlock for us,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that sort of force, Avalanche expects it will be able to generate a large number of neutrons at low cost, which can be used to make radioisotopes and to evaluate materials for use in fusion reactors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company was recently awarded $10 million from Washington State to build FusionWERX, a testing facility that other fusion companies and researchers can book time to study their own fusion technologies. Money for the grant comes from proceeds from the state’s carbon marketplace. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can test your hardware, and then you get to leave with full ownership of your IP at the end of the day,” Langtry said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sales of radioisotopes and rentals of the FusionWERX facility should make Avalanche profitable in 2028, he said. Langtry is forecasting that the company will generate $30 million to $50 million in revenue in 2029.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a path to revenue, and having hit the 300,000-volt milestone, Avalanche is rumored to be raising a Series A round. Langtry wouldn’t comment specifically on the company’s fundraising activities, though he did say that it’s lining up the money needed to fulfill the 50% cost-match requirement of the Washington State grant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve already got a pretty good chunk of it lined up,” he said. Raising money to launch FusionWERX is “goal number one right now,” he added. “Then all the other stuff is going to fall in place as those pieces start getting built.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They’re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/strawberries.php\">“Dirty Dozen” list</a> of the most contaminated produce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tricrobotics.com/\">TRIC Robotics</a>, a San Luis Obispo, California-based, think it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth’s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as supposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,” Stager said. “We found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we’ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn’t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn’t even focused on agriculture to begin with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?” Stager said. “I was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that’s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven’t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC’s robotics.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We loaded two robots that we build in my garage on top of the SUV,” Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. “We had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that’s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of AirBnB surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms, and individual angels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,” Stager said. “I just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there’s really a lot of exciting things to come.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The number has risen from the dozens of known compromised servers as of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/new-zero-day-bug-in-microsoft-sharepoint-under-widespread-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earlier this week</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/chinese-hackers-exploit-microsoft-flaws-us-nuclear-agency-hit?srnd=phx-technology-cybersecurity\">reports</a> that one of the affected organizations includes the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the federal agency responsible for maintaining and developing the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy, which houses the NNSA, did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/hackers-exploiting-sharepoint-zero-day-seen-targeting-government-agencies-say-researchers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other government departments and agencies</a> were also compromised in an early wave of attacks exploiting the SharePoint bug, researchers confirmed.

The startup claims it now has more than 2.3 million active users, and last reported 180,000 paying subscribers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With only 45 full-time employees, and 14 open positions on its careers page, that makes for an impressive employee-to-revenue ratio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subscriptions seem to be driving the bulk of Lovable’s revenue, but the company isn’t prioritizing sales at all costs. Shortly after Lovable said it had reached <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/antonosika/status/1935760127300337691\">ARR of $75 million</a> in June, its CEO Anton Osika wrote on X that Lovable had <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/antonosika/status/1939288991372570854\">“lost $1.5 million ARR in a single day”</a> because it had moved all users on its Team tier to its less expensive Pro tier, which now also accommodates collaboration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Teams plan is now being replaced by a Business tier, which sits between the Pro and custom Enterprise offerings. The new plan offers business-focused features such as self-serve, Single Sign-On (SSO), templates, private projects that won’t be visible to the entire team, and the option to opt-out from having your data be used for training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovable already has a slate of large customers like Klarna, Hubspot and Photoroom, but there are still notable barriers and concerns around vibe coding among enterprises — where the big money is. This new tier could help Lovable find intermediary use cases and drive more businesses to use its tools for more than prototyping, which is what the startup says most people use it for today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has been one focus for the company, and Osika recently said that businesses were driving significant revenue from projects built with Lovable. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says more than 10 million projects have been created on Lovable to date. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $100 million ARR club isn’t large, especially in Europe, but it is growing thanks to tailwinds from all things AI.

Since then, the “women preferences” feature has rolled out to 40 countries, from Argentina and Brazil to Canada, India and Mexico.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a few weeks, this feature will finally make its way to the United States, the company said on Wednesday. Uber plans to pilot the feature in Detroit, Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Women will be able to set a preference for a woman driver in the Uber app, increasing their chances of a match. After that’s done, when a female rider requests a trip, they will see an option called “women drivers.” If the wait is longer than expected, the rider can opt for another ride, according to Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Women drivers can switch their settings to “women rider preference.” This setting can be changed if the driver wants to receive trip requests from all riders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft have grappled with ways to improve safety and attract the broadest set of users — both on the driver and rider sides. But it hasn’t been an easy road.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ride-hailing safety has been a long-standing issue, one that has often pitted advocates and regulators against companies like Uber and Lyft. And while rare, reports of sexual assaults and fatal attacks have only fueled those concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://uber.app.box.com/s/lea3xzb70bp2wxe3k3dgk2ghcyr687x3?uclick_id=46d3f8fb-cc10-450b-ba9e-c60261262b20\">reported</a> 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022, according to its latest U.S. safety report released last year. Uber noted that physical assault fatalities had jumped from previous years. While the incidents still made up a tiny fraction of the 1.8 billion trips that were made in 2021 and 2022 in the U.S., the uptick prompted the company to launch a variety of features to increase safety, including verified rider badges and options to audio and video record rides.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sexual assault incidents have dropped consistently since Uber began reporting the data in 2017. Uber reported 5,981 sexual assaults from 2017 to 2018, and that figure dropped by more than half to 2,717 in the 2021 to 2022 period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft have sought ways to attract more female drivers. Both companies have more male drivers than women — for instance, about 1 in 5 of Uber drivers in the U.S. are women. The “women preferences” feature, designed to give both the rider and driver some control, could help attract more users on both sides.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber was the first major ride-hailing company to launch the women preferences feature. However, rival Lyft was the first to offer a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/12/lyfts-newest-feature-could-convince-more-women-to-drive-for-the-ride-hailing-app/\">women-matching feature in the United States</a> — its primary market. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company says Lumo is based on open-source models, and it will only depend on them for research and development going forward without utilizing user data to train its models. It also said Lumo relies on zero-access encryption, an encryption method that other Proton products also use, to let users store their conversation history, which can be decrypted on the device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Throughout its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://proton.me/blog/lumo-ai\">blog post about Lumo</a>, Proton emphasized its European base, saying it gives the company a leg up over AI companies based in the U.S. and China when it comes to privacy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030409\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=150,45 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=300,91 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=768,233 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=680,206 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=430,130 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=720,218 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=900,272 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=800,242 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=668,202 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=708,214 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?resize=50,15 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image credits: Proton.me</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Lumo is based upon open-source language models and operates from Proton’s European datacenters. This gives you much greater transparency into the way Lumo works than any other major AI assistant. Unlike Apple Intelligence and others, Lumo is not a partnership with OpenAI or other American or Chinese AI companies, and your queries are never sent to any third parties,” Proton said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not Proton’s first foray into the fast-developing AI tools space: Last year, it rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/18/proton-launches-privacy-first-ai-writing-assistant-for-email-that-runs-on-device/\">an AI-powered writing assistant for its Mail product</a> that also runs on the user’s device.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Trump <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/president-trump-repeals-bidens-ai-executive-order/\">repealed Biden’s order within days of his inauguration</a>, arguing that its requirements could be onerous for AI companies, and may hinder American innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its first six months, the Trump Administration has broadly encouraged efforts to accelerate the development and distribution of American AI technology. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">Trump helped OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announce their multi-billion dollar Stargate data center project</a>, and the President <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/trump-administration-officially-rescinds-bidens-ai-diffusion-rules/\">peeled back restrictions on Nvidia</a> selling its AI chips around the globe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, Trump’s AI czar David Sacks has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/trumps-silicon-valley-advisers-have-ai-censorship-in-their-crosshairs/\">picked a fight with technology companies over “woke” AI</a>, claiming that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are supposedly instilling left-leaning values into their AI chatbots and censoring conservative viewpoints. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some are already pushing back on Trump’s AI Action plan for allegedly putting corporate interests ahead of the public. On Tuesday, a group of more than 90 organizations including labor, environmental justice, and consumer protection non-profits <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://peoplesaiaction.com/\">published an open letter called the People’s AI Action Plan</a>. This puts forth a series of AI policies that claim to put the interests of American citizens first, and counter what Trump is expected to announce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can’t let Big Tech and Big Oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families’ well-being,” the group said in a statement to TechCrunch that acknowledged the energy needs of Silicon Valley’s AI data centers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI Action Plan should advance his administration’s agenda more explicitly, but exactly how remains unclear. Trump is expected to share more details about the plan at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/president-donald-j-trump-to-deliver-keynote-address-at-winning-the-ai-race-summit-hosted-by-allin-podcast-and-hill--valley-forum-302505499.html\">the “Winning the AI Race” summit</a>, an event hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum and the All In podcast, which Sacks co-hosts when he’s not serving as a government official or venture capitalist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s what we know about the AI Action Plan so far.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-accelerating-american-ai\">Accelerating American AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI strategy is expected to focus on three pillars — infrastructure, innovation, and global influence — according to a report from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://time.com/7304389/trump-ai-action-plan/\">Time Magazine</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For infrastructure, the Trump administration is reportedly planning to overhaul permitting rules to speed up the development of AI data centers. This aims to help AI companies meet with the growing energy needs to train and serve their AI models. However, it’s widely expected that the rise of AI data centers — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html\">which suck up immense amounts of energy and water from neighboring communities</a> — could <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works\">cause energy shortages by the end of the decade</a> unless there’s a rapid increase in energy production.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The president’s infrastructure pillar is also expected to include a plan to modernize America’s electrical grid and add new sources of energy to power these data centers, according to Time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the innovation front, Trump reportedly plans to use his AI Action Plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-five-years-heres-what-it-means/\">revive the conversation around blocking state AI laws</a> (even though a federal proposition on the issue <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/us-senate-removes-controversial-ai-moratorium-from-budget-bill/\">overwhelmingly failed last month</a>). This is part of an effort to reduce barriers to innovation for American AI companies, but may ultimately block lawmakers from passing meaningful safety and security standards for AI companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the global influence pillar, Trump is expected to put forth a strategy to advance the adoption of American AI models and chips, not just in the U.S., but around the world. Federal officials were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/how-deepseek-changed-silicon-valleys-ai-landscape/\">spooked by the rise of the DeepSeek,</a> and other Chinese AI labs such as Qwen and Moonshot AI have since become worthy competitors to OpenAI. Trump wants America’s technology to be the global standard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To advance its goals, the Trump administration is also expected to sign a series of AI-related executive orders on Wednesday, according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/22/tech-brief-trump-ai-action-plan/\">The Washington Post.</a> Some of these orders clear the path for faster data center buildouts, while others encourage the export of American technologies.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-combatting-woke-ai\">Combatting ‘woke’ AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the executive orders Trump is slated to sign Wednesday would crackdown on “woke” AI models, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/white-house-prepares-executive-order-targeting-woke-ai-e68e8e24?mod=e2tw\">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported earlier this week. The order requires AI companies with federal contracts — which includes OpenAI, xAI, Google, and Anthropic — to ensure their AI models have neutral and unbiased language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The crackdown on “woke” AI marks the Republican party’s latest attack on Silicon Valley’s historically left-leaning crowd. In past years, Republican investigated social media companies for allegedly altering their algorithms to censor conservative voices. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently capitulated to these allegations, and overhauled <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/meta-drops-fact-checking-and-loosens-its-content-moderation-rules/\">Facebook and Instagram’s content moderation</a> to represent more voices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A key question looming around this executive order is who defines whether AI models are neutral or biased, and how they determine it. Trump has long stated he’s an advocate of free speech, so an executive order setting rules around what an AI model can and can’t say may seem counterintuitive. That said, a Florida judge recently ruled that AI chatbots <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/florida-judge-rules-ai-chatbots-not-protected-by-first-amendment/\">are not protected by the First Amendment</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In light of this crack down, OpenAI and other AI labs have tried to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/16/openai-tries-to-uncensor-chatgpt/\">make their AI chatbots represent more viewpoints</a>. These companies are in the awkward position to generate AI responses that please everyone, while also not spreading extremist viewpoints or misinformation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elon Musk, once Trump’s greatest financial backer whose relationship with the president has recently soured, explicitly started xAI to develop an “anti-woke” AI chatbot, Grok, and combat ChatGPT. However, xAI’s effort to create such a chatbot hasn’t gone so well. In recent weeks, xAI was forced to apologize repeatedly when its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/grok-is-being-antisemitic-again-and-also-the-sky-is-blue/\">AI chatbot went on antisemitic rants</a> and<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-4-seems-to-consult-elon-musk-to-answer-controversial-questions/\"> consulted Musk’s personal opinions</a> on hot-button issues.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-silicon-valley-and-big-tech-want\">What Silicon Valley and Big Tech want</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The White House announced in April it had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/public-comments-to-white-house-on-ai-policy-touch-on-copyright-tariffs/\">received more than 10,000 public comments</a> from companies, local governments, and nonprofit organizations regarding Trump’s AI Action Plan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Amazon effectively took the opportunity to submit wishlists of friendly AI policies they’d like to see the Trump administration implement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of America’s leading AI model developers asked Trump to use his AI Action plan to guarantee that training large language models on copyrighted material would be fair use, and should therefore be allowed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such a protection could benefit these companies significantly, as many of them are involved in active lawsuits with copyright owners from the music, film, news, and book industries. These publishers have accused AI companies of illegally training on their copyrighted works to make AI models, potentially devaluing their media in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Meta asked Trump to protect open AI models — which are freely available to download online. By releasing its Llama models openly, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/metas-llamacon-was-all-about-undercutting-openai/\">Meta has been able to undercut OpenAI and Google’s closed offerings</a>. However, Anthropic has raised concerns over whether open AI models could leak powerful technology to bad actors, including China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other interest groups, including nonprofits such as The Future of Life Institute, used the commenting period to ask the Trump administration to increase investment into AI research efforts outside of commercial entities. The request comes at a time when the Trump administration and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/02/11/doge-musk-education-department-research/78411180007/\">DOGE have slashed funding for American universities</a>, many of which have been powerhouses for scientific breakthroughs in recent decades.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems unlikely that Trump’s AI action plan will feature the same safety and security reporting standards that the Biden administration sought to impose. However, polls show that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theaipi.org/april-voters-prefer-ai-regulation-over-self-regulation/\">most Americans want AI companies to be held to safety standards</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several state lawmakers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/new-york-passes-a-bill-to-prevent-ai-fueled-disasters/\">pushing bills that would create safety and security reporting mandates</a>, but they may face opposition from the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers should they contradict Trump’s AI Action Plan..</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

To verify that a device is in “good condition,” it may be required to undergo a diagnostic check using a customer’s iPhone or iPad, or at an Apple Store, before being added to the plan.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?w=486\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030164\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg 2743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=857,1200 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=914,1280 914w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=307,430 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=514,720 514w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=643,900 643w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=571,800 571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=1463,2048 1463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=477,668 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=268,375 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=441,617 441w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=379,531 379w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=36,50 36w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AppleCare One pricing is the same regardless of the products that are covered, meaning a customer can enroll their iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, and save up to $11 a month over enrolling in separate AppleCare+ plans for each device,” Apple explained in a press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means that if someone buys AppleCare One when they purchase a new MacBook Pro and add their iPhone to the plan, they will already be saving money by not having two separate AppleCare+ plans.

These accounts will automatically be placed into the app’s strictest message settings to prevent unwanted messages, and will have the platform’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/in-the-wake-of-recent-racist-attacks-instagram-rolls-out-more-anti-abuse-features/\">“Hidden Words” feature</a> enabled to filter offensive comments. The company is also rolling out new safety features for teen accounts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Accounts that will be placed into the new, stricter message settings include ones run by adults who regularly share photos and videos of their children, along with accounts run by parents or talent managers that represent children.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While these accounts are overwhelmingly used in benign ways, unfortunately, there are people who may try to abuse them, leaving sexualized comments under their posts or asking for sexual images in DMs, in clear violation of our rules,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/07/sharing-latest-updates-metas-child-safety-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “Today we’re announcing steps to help prevent this abuse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it will attempt to prevent potentially suspicious adults, such as people who have already been blocked by teens, from finding accounts that primarily feature children. Meta will avoid recommending suspicious adults to these accounts on Instagram, and vice versa, and make it harder for them to find each other in Instagram Search.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today’s announcement comes as Meta and Instagram have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/08/meta-introduces-restricted-teen-accounts-to-facebook-and-messenger/\">taken steps</a> over the past year to address mental health concerns tied to social media. These concerns have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/10/state-attorneys-endorse-social-media-warning-labels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised by the U.S. Surgeon General</a> and various states, some of which have even <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/to-protect-teens-on-social-media-new-york-targets-the-algorithms-8b5feaae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">gone so far as to require</a> parental consent for access to social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes will significantly impact the accounts of family vloggers/creators and parents running accounts for “kidfluencers,” both of which have <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-dangers-of-parents-sharing-their-childrens-lives-on-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">faced criticism for the risks associated</a> with sharing children’s lives on social media. A New York Times investigation published last year found that the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/us/instagram-child-influencers.html\">parents are often aware</a> of their child’s exploitation or even participating in it, by selling photos or clothing their child wore. In The NYT’s examination of 5,000 parent-run accounts, it found 32 million connections to male followers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the accounts that are placed into these stricter settings will see a notification at the top of their Instagram Feed notifying them that the social network has updated their safety settings. The notice will also prompt them to review their account privacy settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta notes it has removed almost 135,000 Instagram accounts that were sexualizing accounts that primarily feature children, as well as 500,000 Instagram and Facebook accounts that were associated with the original accounts it had removed.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030223\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=768,669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=680,592 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=1200,1045 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=1280,1114 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=430,374 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=720,627 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=900,784 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=800,697 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=1536,1337 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=668,582 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=431,375 431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=709,617 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=610,531 610w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside today’s announcement, Meta is also bringing new safety features to DMs in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/17/instagram-tightens-restrictions-on-teen-accounts-putting-parents-in-control/\">Teen Accounts</a>, its app experience with built-in protections for teens that are automatically applied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teens will now see new options to view safety tips, reminding them to check profiles carefully and be mindful of what they share. Plus, the month and year that the account joined Instagram will be displayed at the top of new chats. In addition, Instagram has added a new block and report option that lets users do both things at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new features are designed to give teens more context about the accounts they’re messaging and help them spot potential scammers, Meta says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These new features complement the safety notices we show to remind people to be cautious in private messages and to block and report anything that makes them uncomfortable – and we’re encouraged to see teens responding to them,” Meta wrote in the blog post. “In June alone, they blocked accounts 1 million times and reported another 1 million after seeing a safety notice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta also provided an update on its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/11/meta-will-auto-blur-nudity-in-instagram-dms-in-latest-teen-safety-step/\">nudity protection filter</a>, noting that 99% of people, including teens, have kept it turned on.

Fertilizer runoff from farm fields has led to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology)\">dead zones</a> in oceans around the world, where low oxygen levels have starved normally teeming coastal waters of life itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eliminating synthetic fertilizers is a tall order, but one startup thinks that its bacteria can eliminate up to half of it, all while undercutting fertilizer on cost.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nzn2.com/\">NetZeroNitrogen</a> has developed a suite of bacterial strains that is applied directly to the seed and allows the plant to get nitrogen from the atmosphere instead of chemicals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a precision sniper approach,” Justin Hughes, co-founder and CEO of NetZeroNitrogen, told TechCrunch. “In contrast to fertilizer, where you spread it all over the field and effectively hope some hits the target, a kind of shotgun approach.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup recently raised a $6.6 million seed round led by World Fund and Azolla Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NetZeroNitrogen’s bacteria are the product of over a decade of research on the part of Gary Devine, who has been studying naturally occurring nitrogen-fixing strains. Hughes pointed out that the company’s bacteria aren’t genetically modified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not on any particular moral high ground about that. It just means the regulatory pathway is a lot easier,” he said. “It opens you up to organic markets as well.” Once the plant dies, the bacteria dies with it.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to roll out its first product for rice. It’s partially a marriage of convenience: to apply the bacterial strains, it’s currently easiest to dunk seeds in water containing them. Rice just so happens to be soaked before planting. “You just mix it in at that point and you’re done,” Hughes said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the company can use large fermenters to grow its strains, it can make its bacterial amendment for less than an equivalent amount of synthetic fertilizer, Hughes said. “The costs of production of biomanufacturing are far, far lower than the Haber-Bosch process, especially once you start to scale up,” he said, referring to the process widely used to make fertilizer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal, Hughes added, is to sell NetZeroNitrogen’s bacteria to farmers for at least $50 per hectare less than they spend on synthetic fertilizers. In regions like Southeast Asia, that could mean a 30% to 40% discount, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, synthetic fertilizer won’t be disappearing. “Unfortunately, we can’t quite solve 100% of the problem yet,” Hughes said. “But of the proportion that we can solve, it’s effectively 100% efficiency.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These rounds — the startup’s first in roughly a decade — valued Gupshup at $1.4 billion. However, Fidelity, which led the round following its unicorn milestone, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/30/fidelity-deepens-valuation-cut-for-saas-startup-gupshup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">slashed its internal valuation</a> of the startup at least three times between 2023 and 2024, bringing it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/30/gupshup-investor-cuts-value-of-its-stake-by-65-implying-new-valuation-of-486m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">down to as low as $486 million</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding round, which combines equity and debt financing from Globespan Capital Partners and EvolutionX Debt Capital, aims to help the San Francisco-headquartered startup expand its presence across its high-growth markets, including India, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup would not reveal the exact debt portion although its founder and CEO Beerud Seth told TechCrunch that the equity part is “a little more than half.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2004, Gupshup — derived from Indian slang meaning “conversations” — started as a platform to help businesses connect with their customers through text messages. It gained popularity as text messages were not free at the time, and people were seeking ways to send messages to their friends and community groups. However, as communication shifted from short messaging service (SMS) to WhatsApp and Rich Communication Services (RCS), the startup moved to these avenues with its chatbot services. Now, as AI has become a catchall term, and AI agents — software that can perform specific tasks on behalf of users — have emerged everywhere, Gupshup has started enabling businesses to deploy agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a lot of demand coming from enterprises. Everybody needs to build these AI agents, which work through messaging like RCS and WhatsApp or through voice. So, building out these agents, there’s huge demand, and we need to support it,” Seth said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Globally, AI agents are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/saas-is-in-the-past-the-future-belongs-to-agents-says-narada-ais-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gaining traction</a>, with startups building them drawing strong investor interest. Tech giants like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/aws-is-launching-an-ai-agent-marketplace-next-week-with-anthropic-as-a-partner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/googles-ai-agents-will-bring-you-the-web-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/microsoft-gives-its-ai-dev-tools-for-windows-a-fresh-coat-of-paint/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft</a> are also exploring how to bring more of these agents to users through their own platforms. The result: competition is heating up.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupshup does not view the rising competition as a threat. Seth pointed to the startup’s substantial install base — which exceeds 50,000 customers across more than 100 countries — and its track record of product innovation, driven by years of experience in business messaging, strategic acquisitions, and internal R&amp;D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Businesses cannot use simple foundation models off the shelf and just put them in front of customers. They need a lot of customization to be done, and that’s where Gupshup comes in. That’s what we provide,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its last round in July 2021, the startup “tripled” its revenue and grew its profitability, Sheth said. However, it is unclear whether that resulted in an increased valuation, as, he said, this latest round was not priced.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a founder, you focus on value, and the valuation will follow,” Seth said when asked whether he still considers the startup a unicorn. “We operate ourselves like we are going to be a big company.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside expanding geographically, the startup aims to utilize its fresh funding to enhance its products, which are used in industries including automotive, banking, e-commerce, fintech, media, payments, retail, and travel. Its products also include click-to-chat ads, an AI campaign copilot, agent assist, and campaign manager.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupshup claims to power over 120 billion messages annually for thousands of enterprises. Looking ahead, the startup sees an IPO as its next major milestone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re talking to all our advisors, lawyers, bankers, accountants, and so on, to figure this out,” Seth said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has no specific timeline for its public listing, although Seth told TechCrunch that it could happen in 18–24 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupshup is exploring whether it should list on Indian stock exchanges — a move that makes strategic sense, as the startup views India, where WhatsApp dominates, as a more favorable market. Among the reasons: it’s easier to communicate its story to local retail investors, who are more familiar with WhatsApp and understand how Gupshup’s products, including its AI agents, operate within the platform. However, since Gupshup is domiciled in the U.S., a flip to India would trigger tax liabilities, which could require additional funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The IPO “is the one thing that we don’t control entirely. The calendar depends as much on external factors as it does on the company,” Seth said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The platform will allow users to pay others using their local wallets and payment systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said the launch partners include India’s NPCI International Payments Limited, which operates mobile payments framework UPI (Unified Payment Interface), China’s Tenpay Global (Tencent’s Payment arm), which operates Weixin (WeChat) payment ecosystem in the country, along with PayPal and Venmo.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also signed an memorandum of understanding with Latin America’s Mercado Pago, a fintech company that enables card and mobile payments, while the final details of the deals are being ironed out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With these partnerships, PayPal wants to cover more than two billion users across the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“PayPal World is a first-of-its-kind payments ecosystem that will bring together many of the world’s largest payment systems and digital wallets on a single platform,” Alex Chriss, President and CEO of PayPal said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The challenge of moving money across borders is incredibly complex, and yet this platform will make it so simple for nearly two billion consumers and businesses. We believe the changes we are announcing today have the potential to be a real game changer over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fintech company said that through PayPal World, PayPal and Venmo users will be able to send money to anyone in the world, even if they aren’t a PayPal user. For instance, when they are traveling in China, they can use PayPal on the Wexin payment network to pay to local businesses. On the flip side, if a customer from India is buying from a site in the U.S., they can use PayPal to check out and pay through their UPI wallet. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Total user base and transaction volume of these wallet systems are massive. For instance, Mercado Pago’s total payment volume was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://investor.mercadolibre.com/download-uspr?path=/news-and-events/mercado-libre-builds-2024-momentum-strong-q1-2025-results-reporting-59-billion-revenue-and-494-million-net-income#:~:text=Fintech:-,Net%20revenue%20from,over%203.3%20billion.\">$58.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025</a>. In India, UPI transactions hit more than $238 billion just for the month of June, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/product-statistics\">according to NPCI data</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">China’s Tenpay is also working on creating a better remittance framework along with enabling cross-border peer-to-peer payments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are glad that Tenpay Global, Tencent’s cross-border payment platform, will support users of PayPal and Venmo in making payments by scanning Weixin Pay<sup>1</sup> QR codes, further expanding access for global digital wallets to transact in the mainland of China. In addition to payments, Tenpay Global will deepen its collaboration with PayPal World in remittances,” Wenhui Yang, CEO of Tenpay Global, said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PayPal World is set to kick off the platform this fall with its launch partners. The company said that in 2026, Venmo users will be able to pay for shopping both online and offline for merchants that support PayPal’s payments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Many members of their family have been executed, and they have no history of traveling abroad,” Amir Rashidi, Miaan Group’s director of digital rights and security, told TechCrunch. “I believe there have been three waves of attacks, and we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rashidi said that Iran is likely the government behind the attacks, although there needs to be more investigations into these attacks to reach a more conclusive determination. “I see no reason for members of civil society to be targeted by anyone other than Iran,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kashfi, who founded the security firm DarkCell, said in an email that he helped two victims go through preliminary forensics steps, but he wasn’t able to confirm which spyware maker was behind the attacks. And, he added, some of the victims he worked with preferred not to continue the investigation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tHave you received a threat notification from Apple?

I presume partly because of their place of work and sensitivity of the matters related to that,” said Kashfi, who added that one of the victims received the notification in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear which spyware maker is behind these attacks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last few years, Apple has sent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/apple-warning-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">several</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/apple-alerts-iphone-users-in-98-countries-to-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">rounds</a> of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/\">notifications</a> to people whom the company believes have been targeted with government spyware, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/\">NSO Group’s Pegasus</a>, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/paragon/\">Paragon’s Graphite</a>. This kind of malware is also known as “mercenary” or “commercial” spyware.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The notifications have helped security researchers who focus on spyware to document abuses in several countries such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/apple-alerts-iphone-users-in-98-countries-to-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">India</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/apple-nso-hacking-notify/\">El Salvador, and Thailand</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102174\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apple’s support page</a> for what the company calls “threat notifications,” last updated in April, the tech giant said that since 2021 it has notified users in “in over 150 countries,” which shows how widespread the use of government spyware is. Apple does not disclose the names of the countries, nor the total number of people it has notified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To help victims, since last year, Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/why-apple-sends-spyware-victims-to-this-nonprofit-security-lab/\">has recommended those who received these threat notifications to reach out to digital rights group AccessNow</a>, which runs an around-the-clock helpline staffed with researchers who can investigate spyware attacks.

Amazon confirmed the acquisition to TechCrunch but noted that the deal has not yet closed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bee, which raised $7 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/29/former-squad-and-twitter-execs-raise-7m-to-build-a-hardware-ai-assistant/\">last year</a>, makes both a stand-alone Fitbit-like bracelet (which retails for $49.99, plus a $19-per-month subscription) and an Apple Watch app. The product records everything it hears — unless the user manually mutes it — with the goal of listening to conversations to create reminders and to-do lists for the user.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zollo <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/29/former-squad-and-twitter-execs-raise-7m-to-build-a-hardware-ai-assistant/\">told TechCrunch</a> last year that the company hopes to create a “cloud phone,” or a mirror of your phone that gives the personal Bee device access to the user’s accounts and notifications, making it possible to get reminders about events or send messages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe everyone should have access to a personal, ambient intelligence that feels less like a tool and more like a trusted companion. One that helps you reflect, remember, and move through the world more freely,” Bee <a href=\"https://www.bee.computer/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claims</a> on its website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/05/the-rabbit-r1-shipped-half-baked-but-thats-kind-of-the-point/\">Rabbit</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">Humane AI</a> have tried to make AI-enabled wearables like this but have not found much success thus far. But at a $50 price point, Bee’s devices are more cost-accessible to a curious consumer who doesn’t want to make a big financial commitment. (The ill-fated Humane AI Pin was $499.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that Bee employees received offers to join Amazon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This acquisition signals Amazon’s interest in developing wearable AI devices, a different avenue from its voice-controlled home assistant products like its line of Echo speakers. ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working on its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/court-filings-reveal-openai-and-ios-early-work-on-an-ai-device/\">AI hardware</a>, while Meta is integrating its AI into its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/meta-unveils-its-oakley-smart-glasses/\">smart glasses</a>. Apple is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/apple-could-launch-ai-powered-smart-glasses-in-2026/\">rumored</a> to be working on AI-powered smart glasses as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These products come with a number of security and privacy risks, given that they record everything around them; different companies’ policies will vary in terms of how voice recordings are processed, stored, and used for AI training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its <a href=\"https://bee-computer.notion.site/privacy-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">current privacy policies</a>, Bee says that users can delete their data at any time and that audio recordings are not saved, stored, or used for AI training. The app does store data that the AI learns about the user, however, which is how it can function as an assistant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bee previously indicated that it planned to only record the voices of people who have verbally consented. Bee also says it’s working on a feature to allow users to define boundaries — both based on topic and location — that will automatically pause the device’s learning. The company noted that it plans to build on-device AI processing, which generally poses less of a privacy risk than processing data in the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if these policies will change as Bee is integrated into Amazon, however — and Amazon has a mixed record on the handling of user data from its customers’ devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past, Amazon <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/ring-reveals-they-give-videos-police-without-user-consent-or-warrant\">shared footage</a> with law enforcement from people’s personal Ring security cameras, with neither the owner’s consent, nor a warrant.

Now, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has confirmed the details of the contract (but not the dollar amount) in <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1947640330318156074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an X post</a> on Tuesday and in <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/stargate-advances-with-partnership-with-oracle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a company blog post.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To recap, on June 30, Oracle disclosed in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001341439/000119312525152035/d136779d8k.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an SEC filing</a> that it had signed a cloud deal that would generate $30 billion a year in revenue. However, the company didn’t say who it was with or for what services. The news caused Oracle’s stock to hit an all-time high, making its founder and CTO, Larry Ellison, the second richest person in the world, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/who-is-larry-ellison-and-how-did-he-amass-a-251-billion-fortune\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Bloomberg.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speculation <a href=\"https://www.futuriom.com/articles/news/can-this-be-oracles-30-billion-customer/2025/07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on the identity</a> of the customer ensued as people wondered what company could possibly need a fresh $30 billion a year in data center services. For comparison, Oracle collectively sold $24.5 billion worth of cloud services in its fiscal 2025 to all customers combined, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001341439/000095017025087926/orcl-20250531.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it reported</a> in June.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has now explained that this Oracle deal is for 4.5 gigawatts of capacity as part of Stargate, the $500 billion data-center-building project OpenAI, Oracle, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">and SoftBank announced in January.</a> (Apparently, the $30 billion deal does not involve SoftBank.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The WSJ reports 4.5 gigawatts is the equivalent of two Hoover Dams, enough power for about four million homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t a straightforward win for Oracle. OpenAI and Oracle still have to build this monster data center, which will be a costly endeavor, both in cash and in energy. They are doing so at what OpenAI called the Stargate I site in Abilene, Texas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Oracle spent $21.2 billion on capital expenditures in its last fiscal year, CEO Safra Catz <a href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/oracle-corporation-nyseorcl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript-1552014/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=msn-news#q-and-a-session\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported in June</a>, and it expects to spend another $25 billion this year, she said. So, nearly $50 billion, largely spent on data centers (and that doesn’t include land purchases, she said) in two years. Although, to be clear, that money also supports Oracle’s existing customers, in addition to OpenAI’s demands.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One final interesting part to note about all of this: Last month, Altman said that OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/openai-claims-to-have-hit-10b-in-annual-revenue/\">recently hit $10 billion</a> in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year.

The request, which was made in July, is a temporary stopgap while the company awaits federal clearance to dredge a permanent channel to the Wallops Island site.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab plans to launch its Neutron medium-lift rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia, a lower-traffic spaceport that’s surrounded by shallow channels and waterways. The company currently launches its Electron small rocket from this location. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab has a sizable checklist to tick off before Neutron can make its orbital debut, like mating the rocket stages, performing a “wet dress” rehearsal, and getting its launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before any of that can happen, the rocket hardware needs to make it onto the island. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab submitted an application for the dredging project to the Virginia Marine Resources Commission in March. In its application, the company touted the benefits of MARS, noting other launch facilities in Florida and elsewhere are highly congested, which could limit launch cadence. MARS, in contrast, “will allow both frequent launch cadence and the return-to-Earth capability of recovering boosters,” Rocket Lab said at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite that upside, MARS is constrained in a crucial way: Existing maritime infrastructure is limited, and access to the channel — called Sloop Gut — depends on favorable tides. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Rocket Lab and its co-applicant, Virginia Port Authority, notes in its request, “there is no permanent existing means of providing safe and reliable access for large infrastructure deliveries to Wallops Island.” (Electron is substantially smaller and delivered via road.)  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab has poured millions into the MARS site to ensure it’s ready to support regular Neutron launches. The company is planning to spend more than $5 million to dredge the roughly mile-long Sloop Gut so barges can perform regular deliveries of large Neutron rocket components. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030163\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png 1668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=680,444 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=1200,783 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=1280,835 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=430,280 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=720,470 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=900,587 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=800,522 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=1536,1002 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=668,436 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=575,375 575w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=946,617 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=708,462 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Rocket lab’s plans to dredge sloop gut.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Rocket Lab</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The dredging project was approved by VMRC in May, but the company has yet to start digging because it’s still awaiting federal sign-off from the Army Corps of Engineers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the company waits for federal approval, Rocket Lab and VPA are seeking permission to use a temporary method called “kedging” to ensure the first five hardware deliveries can arrive on schedule starting in September.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has said it plans to launch Neutron’s maiden test mission in the second half of 2025. But the dredging application and Rocket Lab’s separate kedging request suggest that it’s not hardware delays but maritime access that could be a bottleneck for the first launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kedging, a little-known nautical method, is used to ensure the barges can safely navigate the existing shallow channel. Workers would use a series of anchors and lines to steer the barge through the shallow waters. The company is seeking permission to use this method through the end of June 2026 or until the dredging work is complete, whichever comes first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear how long the dredging project will take. In the case that the kedging request is not approved in a timely manner, Rocket Lab said in its application that it would be able to transport structures over the beach using ramps and cranes. The company received permission for up to three beach barge landing test events — but these cannot take place between March 15 and August 31, so it is far from a long-term solution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the dredging application, the company detailed several other alternative methods to get hardware on the island, like transporting it by road or public boat ramp. However, these methods were ultimately deemed infeasible for reasons such as cost, infrastructure limitations, and the weather. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Both filings highlight the importance of maritime access for Rocket Lab’s Virginia ambitions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sooner the company can start dropping kedge anchors in time to receive the hardware shipments, the sooner it can start knocking off the rest of its pre-flight checklist.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Because of consumer demand for early releases, Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/apple-launches-a-public-beta-program-for-ios/\">for years</a> has been offering public betas following its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. This allows iPhone owners to also get their hands on the updated software before its wider, global launch, but with fewer stability issues and bugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest developer beta (iOS 26 beta 4) largely reflects what users can expect in the coming public beta. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">iOS 26 beta 4 introduces a new “Welcome” splash screen when you first update the software, plus introductory screens for various features, like Siri and its AI-powered notification summaries and prioritization options, as well as for iOS 26’s <a href=\"https://x.com/entropy7th/status/1947722644305989657\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revamped</a> Camera app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, Apple was forced to put its AI notification summaries on pause after complaints by the BBC, which said the feature <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">had misrepresented one of its headlines.</a> The AI-powered news summary claimed Luigi Mangione, the person charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had died by suicide, which wasn’t true. As a result, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/following-complaints-apple-to-further-clarify-when-notification-summaries-use-ai/\">Apple said a software update</a> would be released to clarify when the text shows an AI summarization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The setup screen for this AI summarization feature, still in beta, includes a warning message under the “News &amp; Entertainment” section. Here, Apple notes that “Summarization may change the meaning of the original headlines” and advises users to “Verify information.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other early adopters of the new beta also found that Apple is continuing to refine its user interface redesign known as Liquid Glass. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/ios-26-beta-3-dials-back-liquid-glass/\">beta 3 pulled back</a> on some of the more transparent elements in some apps, beta 4 reverses things again. Testers have pointed to updates in apps like the <a href=\"https://x.com/MehranKhanIX/status/1947725338781618685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">App Store, Photos</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/zollotech/status/1947709872629260331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apple</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/BrandonButch/status/1947711322948276240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1m6l8r1/comment/n4kir6k/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Weather</a>, and elsewhere, and noted that the Notification Center <a href=\"https://x.com/BrandonButch/status/1947713386084483378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also adds a dynamic tint</a> as you scroll.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated software <a href=\"https://x.com/zollotech/status/1947718964273918264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">additionally</a> includes a new dynamic wallpaper, which changes colors, and <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1947729632737833436\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new CarPlay wallpapers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Release notes for beta 4 had not been published on Apple’s Developer website at the time of publication, so there is likely more to be spotted, especially in terms of minor bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside today’s release, Apple also launched new versions of its other betas, including iPadOS 26 beta 4, macOS 26 beta 4, watchOS 26 beta 4, tvOS 26 beta 4, visionOS 26 beta 4, and Xcode 26 beta 4.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Boycotters believe that Etsy is in violation of its policy, as the company notes that prohibited behavior includes not only hate speech, but also “content which directly or indirectly contains violent or degrading commentary against protected classes listed above.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030030\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg 2324w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=768,597 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=680,528 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=1200,933 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=1280,995 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=430,334 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=720,560 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=900,699 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=800,622 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=1536,1194 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=2048,1592 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=668,519 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=483,375 483w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=794,617 794w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=683,531 683w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Etsy’s site has 20 pages of “Alligator Alcatraz”-branded merchandise</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Etsy screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Etsy boycott has been loosely organized on social media platforms like Meta’s <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/search?q=Boycott%20Etsy&amp;serp_type=tags&amp;tag_id=18370523275075527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Threads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=etsy+boycott&amp;cId=158e8864-1645-4da9-89a6-e583d6e20f20&amp;iId=1e096200-c3d2-4ba0-adb0-49ae10ed7396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reddit</a> so far, where there are thousands of posts and comments. For example, <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@sarahzsays\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one Threads post</a> that references the boycott received more than 26,500 likes and a<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1lrwuz4/what_are_they_thinking_over_at_etsy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> Reddit post exclaiming “What are they thinking over at Etsy?!”</a> has 69,000 upvotes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When searching for the term “<a href=\"https://www.threads.com/search?q=Boycott%20Etsy&amp;serp_type=tags&amp;tag_id=18370523275075527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Boycott Etsy</a>” on Threads, you’ll find a long stream of posts debating the boycott, many of which have hundreds of replies. Some Etsy sellers worry their online businesses will suffer as a result, even though they are not selling this type of merchandise. Others, including those who disagree with the Trump administration’s policies, believe the merchandise is protected free speech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Reddit’s Etsy Community and elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@alainndesigns/post/DLnBQ1vu9Oi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">boycotting</a> <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@aprilgracebaker/post/DLm8oWtpchr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sellers</a> are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsyCommunity/comments/1lweevw/ive_been_horrified_by_what_etsy_is_allowing_and/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">threatening to close their shops</a>, and buyers say they’re <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/chaoticgood/comments/1lwkkg7/boycott_evil_fucking_etsy_sellers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closing</a> their accounts. There are also references to the boycott across other social media sites like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.walmart.com/search?q=Alligator%20Alcatraz\">X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@yaptrapped/video/7522951152758033677?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-8yF7uTQvoJ5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=boycott%20etsy\">Facebook</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the effort is so far only loosely organized, it’s difficult to tell how many are participating. According to data from app intelligence provider Appfigures, Etsy’s iOS app in the U.S. hasn’t slipped in the ranks at this time — it’s been in the top 20 apps in the Shopping category throughout the month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etsy is not alone in profiting from this type of merchandise, as some sellers and buyers have also pointed out. Many major selling platforms have not banned “Alligator Alcatraz”-branded products at this time. Among those TechCrunch reached out to, only Amazon was willing to defend its choice to host this merchandise, pointing us to its <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/amazons-approach-to-controversial-products-and-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">policy around controversial products and content</a>. The company also said the “Alligator Alcatraz” merchandise was compliant with its <a href=\"https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/200164670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">guidelines</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etsy did not respond to multiple requests for comment. eBay responded to an email request, but never shared a comment. Shopify didn’t respond, nor did smaller platforms like Redbubble and TeePublic. (Walmart and Target were not found to be hosting this type of merchandise at this time. Walmart told TechCrunch it has clear guidelines around prohibited products, and those that don’t comply are “promptly removed.”)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etsy also featured a couple of sellers with pro-“Alligator Auschwitz” branded merchandise, among other listings for merchandise calling for its abolition (as seen in the screenshot below).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030031\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg 2242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=768,589 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=680,522 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=1200,921 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=1280,982 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=430,330 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=720,552 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=900,690 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=800,614 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=1536,1178 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=2048,1571 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=668,512 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=489,375 489w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=804,617 804w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=692,531 692w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Etsy screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">E-commerce platforms have weathered storms like this before, and have been known to host products that promote both right-wing and left-wing views without taking a political stance themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in more extreme cases, the companies have capitulated to customer backlash. For instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/shopify-took-down-kanyes-swastika-t-shirt-shop-but-another-antisemitic-storefront-still-operates/\">earlier this year</a>, Shopify was caught hosting a storefront run by Kanye that was selling a swastika T-shirt and took it down, though it continued to host other stores that featured antisemitic content. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/1/11/22224722/amazon-oath-keepers-3-three-percenters-hats-badges-merch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon also previously faced backlash</a> over its decision to host right-wing militia merchandise and products celebrating QAnon conspiracies, and also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-removes-proud-boys-trump-quote-merchandise-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pulled</a> those <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/retailers-are-already-pulling-stand-back-and-stand-by-merch-from-online-shelves/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">products</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/business/amazon-qanon.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">down</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
