Birds chirp, contributing to the tropical din, as he approaches a shrine at the base of a starfruit tree. He bends to inspect a framed black-and-white photograph of a woman, her hair in a 1950s side part. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Suddenly, a gust of wind shakes the tree’s branches, knocking over the contents of the shrine. The man steps back, trips on a root, and hits his head. When he awakens, he’s in a dark, misty forest, a woman wearing a clay mask standing over him, brandishing a sword. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Who are you who dares to sleep under the sacred tree?” she asks in Ilocano, a Hawaiian dialect of Filipino, while holding the sword at his throat. He replies that he’s lost and turns to flee. She chases, alternating between running and floating through the air. He falls again. She advances, sword held high. He throws a rock at her, shattering the clay mask and revealing half her face. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mom?” he asks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the opening of “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl-QFbdEj8M\">Murmuray</a>,” a short film by independent filmmaker Brad Tangonan. Everything about this film felt like his previous work, from the tactile nature shots to the dreamlike desaturated highlights. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The only difference? He made it using AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tangonan was one of 10 filmmakers to participate in Google Flow Sessions, a five-week cohort that gave creatives access to Google’s suite of AI tools to produce short films, including Gemini, image generator Nano Banana Pro, and film generator Veo.   </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each film differed in scope. Hal Watmough’s “You’ve Been Here Before” blended hyperreal, lifelike visuals with cartoonish stylization to playfully explore the importance of a morning routine, while Tabitha Swanson’s “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hzwbRnIwo\">The Antidote to Fear is Curiosity</a>” is a more esoteric, philosophical conversation about our relationship with AI and ourselves. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of these short films, which were screened at Soho House New York late last year, felt like AI slop. Each independent filmmaker I spoke to said that, in the case of these films, AI had enabled them to tell a story they otherwise wouldn’t have had the budget or time to tell. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mumuray - Short Film (Trailer)\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tl-QFbdEj8M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I see all of these tools, whether it be a camera you can pick up or generative AI, as ways for an artist to express what they have in their mind,” Tangonan told me after the screenings. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This AI-is-just-another-tool-for-creators argument is certainly the message Google is trying to underscore. Google isn’t wrong; AI will increasingly be part of a creator’s toolkit as video generation products improve. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, companies like Google, Runway, OpenAI, Kling, Luma AI, and Higgsfield progressed far beyond the uncanny, prompt-based novelties of the year prior. The AI video industry, with billions in venture capital dollars in tow, is now moving from prototype to post-production.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This era of AI abundance that has provided tools to “democratize access” to the film industry also threatens to erase jobs and creativity, smothering them under an avalanche of low-effort slop. The existential stakes have pitted creatives against one another. Those who engage with AI risk being labeled as complicit; those who don’t risk becoming obsolete. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question isn’t whether the tools belong in the toolkit – they’re coming, whether we like it or not. Instead it is: what kind of filmmaking survives when the industry pushes for speed and scale over quality? And what happens when individual artists use the same tools to make something that actually matters?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-but-is-it-slop\"><strong>But is it slop?</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094472\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam used AI to animate scans of plants and fish in her short film “Mimesis.”</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Keenan MacWilliam</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The arguments against AI in filmmaking are plentiful — and from some of the highest-profile names in the industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guillermo-del-toro-finally-makes-his-own-frankenstein/id214089682?i=1000733180492\">said last October</a> that he would rather die than use generative AI to make a film. James Cameron said in a recent <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0uKh4VT6s8&amp;t=1586s\">CBS interview</a> the idea of generating actors and emotions with prompts is “horrifying,” and that generative AI is only capable of spitting out a blended average of everything that’s ever been done by humans before. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Werner Herzog said the films he’s seen created by AI “have no soul.” He added: “The common denominator, and nothing beyond this common denominator, can be found in these fabrications.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cameron and Herzog’s thesis is that AI is taking the wheel of creation out of the hands of humans and couldn’t possibly be used to create a representation of their own lived experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s very easy to be angry with AI as a concept in the machine, but it’s harder to be angry with someone that’s made something personal,” Watmough told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tangonan, who describes “Murmuray” as a “family story,” agrees with that sentiment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is a facilitator,” Tangonan said. “I’m still making all the creative decisions. When people see ‘AI slop’ online, it’s a lot of lowest common denominator stuff. And, yeah, if you hand over the keys to AI, that’s what you’re going to get. But if you have a voice and a creative perspective and a style, then you’re going to get something different.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using AI in filmmaking doesn’t mean just prompting a film into existence. Tangonan, for example, wrote the script for “Murmuray” without AI and gathered visual references for a shot list. He then fed that content into Nano Banana Pro to generate images that matched his style and served as the foundation for video generation.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam also took pains to ensure her short film “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQR8Py0kmPA\">Mimesis</a>,” a fictional guided meditation, was a “true extension of [her] visual language, rather than a ‘blender’ of other artists’ work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MacWilliam wrote the script and recorded her own voice for the mock meditation, which was equal parts relaxing and funny. Onscreen, over a black, watery backdrop, psychedelic images of flowers and plants blended into each other, turned into smoke, morphed into seahorses and swam away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The images all came from MacWilliam’s own collection of scanned flora and fauna – she travels with her scanner everywhere she goes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I spent a lot of time learning how to make apps that were built with my own dataset, and then used those as reference points,” MacWilliam told TechCrunch, adding that she worked with her long-time composer and sound designer on the film. “I made a choice to avoid using AI for anything that I could have shot with a camera or ask my collaborators to animate. My goal was to unlock new forms of expression for my established themes and style, not to replace the roles of the people who I like to work with.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That was a common thread among the filmmakers I spoke to at the Google Flow event – the desire to use AI only in cases when it was not possible to rely on other humans, or when the strange nature of AI generations serve the story. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, Sander van Bellegem’s “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sander-van-bellegem_last-friday-i-had-the-chance-to-premiere-activity-7408924221202006018-diM8/?utm_medium=ios_app&amp;rcm=ACoAABLnShEBS_n2qGWsidtdfkmYqt-f8sZLBvo&amp;utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_campaign=copy_link\">Melongray</a>” explored the acceleration of life through trippy visualizations. In one shot, a salamander transforms into a balloon. It wasn’t part of his original storyline, but he was inspired by the way AI allowed him to push the limits of both his imagination and physics. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-to-be-efficient-or-not-to-be\"><strong>To be [efficient] or not to be</strong>?</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"OCEAN VIEW\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/636k7kUf9zc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today’s film studio <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/hollywood-jobs-are-disappearing/556a88af-b759-491f-8589-d6aa2d3a432e?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">budgets are being squeezed</a> by rising filming costs, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/poll-movies-streaming-theaters-tickets-a1b6b6d48f47389f422ab7299c4e3e74\">pivot to streaming</a>, and risk-averse corporate consolidation. That means big spends are saved for predictable revenue generators (see: the millionth Marvel movie) and original <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.greenlightanalytics.com/box-office-behavior-netflix-mid-budget-viewership/?utm_\">mid-budget movies</a> have all but been abandoned. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adding AI to the mix risks exacerbating the scarcity mindset of studios to the point where they might try to replace anything that can be — actors, sets, lighting — art and quality be damned. However, the efficiencies AI brings could also lower barrier and make it easier for film studios to produce original work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even Cameron noted in his CBS interview that generative AI could make VFX cheaper, which could lead to more imaginative sci-fi and fantasy films – expensive endeavors that are reserved for existing IP like “Avatar.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shot in “Murmuray” where the woman is flying through the forest would have taken expensive VFX or very complex rigging on set, both out of budget for a short film, according to Tangonan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even filmmakers who see the benefits in efficiency understand the risks to artistic expression. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think efficiency in general is not the best friend of creativity,” MacWilliam said.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-empowered-and-isolated\"><strong>Empowered and isolated</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094473\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Hal Watmough’s short film “You’ve Been Here Before” playfully explores the importance of morning routine. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Hal Watmough</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For independent filmmakers, having so many powerful tools at their disposal is a blessing and a curse. It “democratizes access,” sure, but it also means working alone. The more you <em>can</em> do yourself, the less reason there is to collaborate. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know I’m a one man band, and I just made all this by myself…but that should never be the way that anyone tells a story or makes a film,” Watmough told TechCrunch, noting that an actor friend of his contributed the voice for his short. “It should be a collaborative process because the more people that are involved, the more accessible it is by everyone and the more it reaches and connects with people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Directors make creative decisions, but not all of them. The filmmakers I spoke to found themselves suddenly playing set designer, lighting director, costumer – roles requiring expertise they didn’t have. It was frustrating and draining, pulling them away from the work they actually cared about. And upsetting to think about how an entire ecosystem could be upended so swiftly. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The filmmakers I spoke to also said they’d rather not replace actors with AI, though some said AI-generated actors are an inevitability for smaller studios. The tools exist, and are increasingly getting better, to generate actors, their emotions, their movements. AI video startups like Luma AI, which last November raised <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lumalabs.ai/press/luma-ai-raises-900-million-series-c-led-by-humain-and-partners-on-2-gigawatt-ai-supercluster-in-saudi-arabia\">a $900 million Series C</a>, are even building technology that allows you to shoot an actor’s performance once, and then use AI to change the character, costume, and set. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In an ideal world, I would work with real actors and some cinematographer and department heads and the full crew to make something amazing and use AI and complement that to be able to do things that we can’t do on set, whether for budgetary or time reasons,” Tangonan. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-if-artists-don-t-define-ai-studios-will\"><strong>If artists don’t define AI, studios will</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"MIMESIS: A Salmon Skin Meditation\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQR8Py0kmPA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think making any creative work that uses new technology always requires a certain kind of gut check and a willingness to have conversations around the work,” Swanson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are tools,” she added. “How are you going to use the tool? Are you going to be ethical about it? Are you going to ask questions? Are you going to be transparent and share knowledge?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But many don’t see AI tools as neutral. Labor replacement aside, there are still copyright concerns. AI video generation startup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.404media.co/runway-ai-image-generator-training-data-youtube/\">Runway</a> has reportedly scraped thousands of hours of YouTube videos and copyrighted studio content, others – including Google, OpenAI, and Luma AI – have faced questions about whether they are doing the same, or training on copyrighted films and stock footage without permission. (Though some tools, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/moonvalleys-ethical-ai-video-model-for-filmmakers-is-now-publicly-available/\">Moonvalley’s Marey</a>, are trained only on openly licensed data). Then there are the environmental horrors – <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/youll-be-as-annoyed-as-me-when-you-learn-how-much-energy-a-few-seconds-of-ai-video-costs?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">some estimates suggest </a>generating seconds of AI video can consume as much electricity as hours of streaming. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, many of the filmmakers I spoke to said they face stigma for experimenting with AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Whenever I do post things online, a lot of my filmmaking colleagues have a very knee jerk reaction to it that we should all hold the line and not use any of these tools,” Tangonan said. “I just don’t agree with that.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If filmmakers are too afraid to discuss how AI can and should be used and what the ethical boundaries are, then the conversation risks being decided for them. Not by artists trying to use it responsibly, but by efficiency-crazed studios that care more about bottom lines than art. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The film industry is floundering because people aren’t innovating and everything costs too much. We need tools like this for it to survive,” said Watmough. “I think it’s essential that people engage with it because if we don’t, then it’s going to become something we don’t recognize, and that’s not sustainable.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-\"><br></h2>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/06/sequoia-rebrands-china-india-and-southeast-asia-units/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">split from Sequoia Capital in 2023</a>, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit</a>, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/general-catalyst-commits-5b-to-india-over-five-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion</a> in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh said Peak XV is not trying to match rivals dollar-for-dollar, emphasizing that the firm’s priority is generating strong returns rather than maximizing assets under management. The firm will continue to size its funds based on where it sees the best opportunity to deliver “high-performing funds,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Peak XV is still building its presence in the U.S. and is selective about where it competes. “In the U.S. market, we are an underdog — and that’s great,” Singh said, adding that the firm is focusing on areas where its experience in software, developer tools and fintech gives it an edge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest fundraise follows a period of leadership changes at Peak XV, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/peak-xv-says-internal-disagreement-led-to-partner-exits-as-it-doubles-down-on-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent departures</a> of senior partner Ashish Agrawal and investors Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma. Singh told TechCrunch the firm retains significant experience on its leadership team, noting that five of its seven managing partners have been with Peak XV for more than a decade. The broader Peak XV team includes more than 30 full-time investors, with about a dozen leading investments across its markets.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV has returned more than $7 billion in cash to investors since inception, Singh said, adding that 35 of its portfolio companies have gone public. He declined to specify distributions since the firm’s split from Sequoia Capital. In September 2024, TechCrunch reported that the firm had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/peak-xv-has-reaped-1-2b-in-the-year-since-it-split-from-sequoia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">returned about $1.2 billion</a> in the year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahead of the current raise, Peak XV’s prior fund was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/peak-xv-top-india-sea-venture-firm-trims-fund-size-and-fees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sized at $2.85 billion</a> in late 2021, before the firm split from Sequoia Capital. That figure was later reduced to about $2.4 billion as part of what Singh described as a disciplined approach to capital. The earlier pool included Peak XV’s India growth strategy, and Singh said the firm does not plan to raise a new growth fund until more of that dry powder is deployed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh expects to deploy the new capital primarily into AI, fintech, and consumer startups, while also seeing emerging opportunities in deep tech. The firm has made more than 80 investments in AI startups to date. He added that the U.S.-India ties are becoming increasingly important as more founders in the region build for global markets.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Transformers haven’t changed much since Thomas Edison made his first light bulb. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, a string of startups are working to modernize the transformer, replacing it with modern power electronics that promise to give grid operators more control over how and where electricity flows. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It becomes a very powerful device, equivalent to your internet router,” Subhashish Bhattacharya, co-founder and CTO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dgmatrix.com\">DG Matrix</a>, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three startups recently raised sizable rounds to scale up production of their solid-state transformer technologies. This week, DG Matrix raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/dg-matrix-raises-60m-to-make-data-center-power-smarter/\">$60 million Series A</a> and Heron Power raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/heron-power-raises-140m-to-ramp-production-of-grid-altering-tech/\">$140 million in a Series B</a> round. In November, Amperesand raised $80 million to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/amperesand-targets-data-centers-as-the-next-big-customer-for-its-solid-state-transformers/\">chase after</a> the burgeoning data center market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Existing transformers are reliable and efficient, but that’s about it. They’re relatively crude instruments, made largely of copper and iron. They react passively to changes on the grid and are capable of tackling only one task per device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“An old-school steel, copper, and oil transformer doesn’t have any monitoring, doesn’t have any control,” Drew Baglino, founder and CEO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heronpower.com/\">Heron Power</a>, told TechCrunch. In instances where electricity surges or a power plant trips offline, that can be a liability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The devices can incorporate power from a range of difference sources — including traditional power plants, renewables, and batteries — and transform that electricity into either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) at a number of different voltages, allowing them to replace several devices.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For data centers, solid-state transformers offer an appealing alternative, allowing them to shrink the footprint of their power systems while giving them finer control over where and how electricity is directed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solid-state transformers poised to arrive at a time when existing transformers are aging and demand for new ones is surging — a classic tech supercycle. Most transformers on the grid today are several decades old, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/87653.pdf\">according</a> to the National Laboratory of the Rockies. As demand from data centers, EV chargers, and other parts of the grid rises, the NLR expects the amount of power flowing through transformers to double by 2050.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While data centers are the the first market those companies are chasing, they also have their sights set on the electrical grid, which in the U.S. alone hosts <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.nlr.gov/docs/fy25osti/92076.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">as many as 80 million transformers</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of the distribution transformers are ultimately going to need to be replaced. Over 50% of them are 35 years old. There’s a big need for an upgrade,” Baglino said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because they’re are made from silicon-based materials, they’re flexible, controllable, and software-updatable. They’re also immune from price fluctuations that rock the copper market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Power semiconductors keep getting cheaper. Steel, copper, and oil, unfortunately, is not in that situation,” Baglino said. “Commodity prices can move all over the place, and they generally move up.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an old-style transformer, power flows into the transformer through copper wires wound around one side of an O-shaped iron core. As the electricity flows, it induces a magnetic field in the core. On the other side of the core, the magnetic field induces electricity in another set of copper windings. If the wires wrap around the core more times on the input side than the output side, the voltage decreases on the output side. If the ratio inverts, the output voltage increases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solid-state transformers eschew the copper windings in favor of semiconductors, using materials like silicon carbide or gallium nitride to handle frequency conversion. They can come in a range of configurations, with the most comprehensive setup consisting of three basic parts: a rectifier that converts alternating current to direct current, a converter that changes the voltage of the direct current, and an inverter that changes the direct current back into alternating current.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike iron-core transformers, solid-state transformers can handle power that flows in both directions, making them useful in places that need backup power, like data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a data center, a solid-state transformer can replace several different pieces of equipment, not just the transformer that steps voltage down from the grid. Every data center uses backup power, which requires a string of devices to bring power into the facility. Solid-state transformers can handle all of those duties in one box.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The technology also allows data centers to more easily integrate so-called behind-the-meter power, where generating capacity is connected directly to the data center, not the grid. Those typically require another set of transformers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And when coupled with grid-scale batteries, solid-state transformers can eliminate uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), too, freeing up space inside the data center for more racks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you add up the cost of everything we’ve taken out, we’re 60% to 70% of that cost,” Haroon Inam, co-founder and CEO of DG Matrix, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DG Matrix has been focusing on its Interport technology, which can route power from multiple sources to multiple loads of differing voltages, a setup the company holds multiple patents on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heron Power, meanwhile, is working to transforming medium-voltage power in data centers, solar farms, and grid-scale battery installations. In a data center, it’s Heron Link transformers can provide racks with 30 seconds of power while backup sources come online. Altogether, Heron Link occupy 70% less space than existing parts. At a solar farm, Heron Power’s transformers can perform the duties of an inverter and a transformer for the same price.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a head-to-head comparison, solid state transformers still command a cost premium over iron-core transformers. For that reason, they’re unlikely to replace the giant humming boxes at grid substations in the very near future. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in data centers and at EV charging hubs, where solid-state transformers take the place of several pieces of equipment, they’ll start making inroads. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When they finally hit the grid in bigger numbers, they have the potential to cut down on transmission and distribution costs, one of the biggest contributors to utility bill inflation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because today’s transformers are passive, unable to react to fluctuations, distribution networks have been built with a significant amount of spare capacity, Baglino said. Solid-state transformers, though, and can respond to changing conditions, allowing grid operators to send more power through the same lines.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can actually make the infrastructure more affordable because you’re putting more kilowatt-hours through the same poles and wires,” he said. “That’s where intelligence, in place of passive mechanical objects that were designed 100 years ago, can make a big difference.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company offers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\">a sub-$5 subscription tier</a> in the country, and last year even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/\">ran promotional campaigns</a> to spur adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI adoption is moving faster than our ability to measure it – and that’s a challenge for anyone trying to make smart decisions.

She, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openais-former-sales-leader-joins-vc-firm-acrew-openai-taught-her-where-startups-can-build-a-moat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">like the other OpenAI alums</a> who did not become founders, decided to become an investor and said she was going to tap into the ex-OpenAI founder network to look for deal flow. We know Peter Deng, OpenAI’s former head of consumer products (and now general partner at Felicis) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/top-openai-google-brain-researchers-set-off-a-300m-vc-frenzy-for-their-startup-periodic-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">already has</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below is a roundup of the major startups founded by OpenAI alumni, in alphabetical order. And we are certain this list will grow over time. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-david-luan-adept-ai-labs-nbsp\">David Luan — Adept AI Labs </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Luan was OpenAI’s engineering VP until he left in 2020. After a stint at Google, in 2021 he co-founded Adept AI Labs, a startup that builds AI tools for employees. The startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/adept-a-startup-training-ai-to-use-existing-software-and-apis-raises-350m/\">last raised $350 million at a valuation north</a> of $1 billion in 2023, but Luan <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/amazon-forms-a-new-ai-agent-focused-lab-led-by-adept-co-founder/\">left in late 2024 to oversee Amazon’s AI agents lab</a> after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/28/amazon-hires-founders-away-from-ai-startup-adept/\">Amazon hired Adept’s founders</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dario-amodei-daniela-amodei-and-john-schulman-anthropic\">Dario Amodei, Daniela Amodei, and John Schulman — Anthropic</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in 2021 to form their own startup, San Francisco-based Anthropic, that has long <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety\">touted</a> a focus on AI safety. OpenAI co-founder John Schulman <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/openai-co-founder-leaves-for-anthropic/\">joined Anthropic in 2024</a>, pledging to build a “safe AGI.” The company has since become OpenAI’s biggest rival and just raised<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/anthropic-raises-another-30-billion-in-series-g-with-a-new-value-of-380-billion/\"> a $30 billion Series G, nabbing a $380 billion valuation </a>in the process.

The announcement marks a significant increase from the $500 million to $1 billion the firm had previously earmarked for India.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, the world’s most populous country with more than a billion internet users, is positioning itself as a major AI investment destination. New Delhi aims to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/india-bids-to-attract-over-200b-in-ai-infrastructure-investment-by-2028/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">attract over $200 billion in AI infrastructure investments</a> over the next two years as it hosts the India AI Impact Summit with participation from companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“India will build the next generation of global platform companies,” General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja (pictured above) said, adding that the firm sees Indian founders as uniquely positioned to develop technology for markets serving enormous populations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Catalyst said it sees India’s biggest AI opportunity in large-scale real-world deployment rather than in building so-called frontier models. The firm cited the country’s government-built digital infrastructure, vast domestic market, and deep services talent pool as reasons for that view.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push comes as India’s AI ambitions accelerate. At the summit, conglomerates <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/adani-pledges-100b-for-ai-data-centers-as-india-seeks-bigger-role-in-global-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adani Group</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/reliance-unveils-110b-ai-investment-plan-as-india-ramps-up-tech-ambitions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reliance Industries</a>, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, announced plans to invest more than $200 billion combined to build AI data center infrastructure in the country. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-taps-tata-for-100mw-ai-data-center-capacity-in-india-eyes-1gw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI has separately partnered with Tata Group’s TCS</a> — one of India’s largest tech companies — to develop a 100-megawatt AI data center as part of the expansion of its Stargate infrastructure project.

Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won’t receive its equity until the company’s next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo’s stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm’s ownership drops to just 0.75%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, Y Combinator <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/deal\">typically takes a fixed 7% </a>of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re offering a deal so great that it’s appropriate even for founders who are not even considering any other accelerator,” Partovi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> The lower equity cost is only part of Neo Residency’s appeal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders will work for three months at Neo’s offices in San Francisco’s Jackson Square district, participate in a two-week bootcamp in the Oregon mountains, and be mentored by about 30 experienced operators, including Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, and Fuzzy Khosrowshahi, CTO of Notion (and the creator of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bubble.io/blog/the-new-build-02-fuzzy-khosrowshahi/\">Google Sheets</a> and also Partovi’s uncle).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the program’s main draw is its prestige: Seed and Series A investors generally have great respect for founders handpicked by Partovi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The one [accelerator] I like right now that has very high signal, and every founder I met there is just wicked smart, is Neo,” Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner of FPV Ventures, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILQ6WkufBs8&amp;t=1732s\">said on stage at 2025 TechCrunch Disrupt</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups that have gone through the program include Moment, a fintech company that has raised <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/ai-startup-cursor-raises-funds-at-29-3-billion-value-wsj-says\">$56 million</a> from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, and Anterior, a healthcare AI startup backed by NEA and Sequoia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Neo Residency will also select five to eight students—either as individuals or small teams—who will receive a $40,000, no-strings-attached grant to take a semester off to work on a project. While there is no requirement to drop out or start a formal company immediately, Partovi said he hopes the students will catch the entrepreneurial bug and, when they eventually launch a startup, turn to Neo for funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neo is keeping the program small and elite: it will cap its two annual cohorts at 20 teams each, consisting of a mix of active startups and student projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why is Neo offering such generous terms? “We have more confidence in our ability to attract and pick out future superstars than ever before,” Partovi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His track record suggests that confidence is well-founded. He famously met Cursor co-founder Michael Truell while Truell was still an MIT student and later wrote one of the first checks into the AI coding startup, now valued at nearly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/coding-assistant-cursor-raises-2-3b-5-months-after-its-previous-round/\">$30 billion</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The push is intended to help the AI chipmaker cultivate relationships with future customers in one of the world’s fastest-growing developer markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest move comes through a partnership with early-stage venture firm <a href=\"https://www.activatevc.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Activate</a>, which plans to back about 25 to 30 AI startups from its $75 million debut fund while giving portfolio companies preferential access to Nvidia’s technical expertise. The collaboration follows other India-focused efforts unveiled this week, including work with nonprofit AI Grants India to support early-stage founders and new ties with venture firms focused on the South Asian nation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flurry of activity comes as India hosts its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi, drawing top technology companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was slated to attend but skipped the event due to what the company called unforeseen circumstances. A senior delegation led by executive vice president Jay Puri attended in his place, meeting AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners on the ground.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing pools of AI developers and startups, making it an increasingly important market for Nvidia as it looks to expand adoption of chips and computing software. By working more closely with founders at the earliest stages, the company is positioning itself to capture long-term demand as new AI-native companies scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aakrit Vaish, founder of Activate, said Nvidia’s engagement with startups in India has historically been relatively light-touch compared with the U.S., but the chipmaker is now looking to work with founders much earlier in their journey. Activate aims to leverage that shift by connecting portfolio startups directly with Nvidia experts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The VC firm, which Vaish describes as focused on “inception investing,” meets technical teams months before company formation and works closely with them as they grow. Its backers include venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Perplexity co-founder Aravind Srinivas, Peak XV managing director Shailendra Singh, and Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, underlining the prominent network Activate is assembling around its early-stage strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Nvidia, the logic behind partnering with an early-stage venture firm is straightforward: the earlier it builds relationships with promising AI startups, the more likely those companies are to rely on its computing infrastructure as they scale. Vaish told TechCrunch that growing startups typically consume increasing amounts of AI compute over time, making early technical engagement valuable for the chipmaker as a way of generating future business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia already has a sizable presence in the country through its <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Inception program</a>, which supports more than 4,000 startups in India. This week, the chipmaker also <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/india-ai-mission-infrastructure-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded its local ecosystem ties</a>, including partnerships with venture firms such as Accel, Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners to identify and fund AI startups. It separately teamed up with AI Grants India, co-founded by Vaibhav Domkundwar and Bhasker (Bosky) Kode, to support more than 10,000 early-stage founders over the next 12 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also been broadening its startup outreach in India over time. In November 2025, Nvidia <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/nvidia-qualcomm-join-u-s-indian-vcs-to-help-build-indias-next-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">joined the India Deep Tech Alliance</a>, a consortium of U.S. and Indian investors including Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, and Celesta Capital, to provide strategic and technical guidance to emerging startups in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vaish said Activate’s partnership with Nvidia is designed to provide a more curated layer on top of the company’s broad-based Inception program, which serves thousands of startups globally. By serving as an early filter for high-potential technical teams, Activate aims to give its portfolio companies more direct, timely access to Nvidia’s engineering expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stepped-up activity underscores intensifying competition among global technology firms to court AI developers and startups in India, which has become one of the fastest-growing pools of technical talent outside the U.S.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Despite the strategic priority that the hardware product represents, the company recently shed one of the top executives tied to the project, reportedly over a dispute with Snap CEO Evan Spiegel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech blog Sources <a href=\"https://x.com/alexeheath/status/2024340366582038960?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">originally reported</a> that the company had recently lost Scott Myers, its SVP of Specs, over a supposed “blow-up” with Spiegel.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment by TechCrunch, a Snap spokesperson said that Myers had “decided to step down from his role at Snap.” The statement thanked him for his contributions, and wished him “the best in his next chapter.” The spokesperson also disputed the “blow-up” characterization but wouldn’t reveal more about Myers’ departure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The spokesperson added: “We can’t wait to bring Specs to the world later this year. We remain focused on disciplined execution and long-term value creation for our developer partners, community and shareholders.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear when exactly Myers left the company, or what the alleged “blow-up” might have entailed. When a user on X asked Sources author Alex Heath about the nature of the reported dispute, he replied that it was about “<a href=\"https://x.com/alexeheath/status/2024344234636304493?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">strategy</a>,” adding that he couldn’t reveal more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap has teased the commercial release of Specs for quite a while and, in recent months, has signaled that it’s getting serious about the product’s launch. In January, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/\">spun off the Specs team</a> into its own distinct subsidiary, Specs Inc., saying that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Myers joined the Snap team in 2020 and, prior to that, held roles at SpaceX, Apple, and Nokia, according to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-myers-7a63b22/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">his LinkedIn</a> profile. In <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/exclusive-i-asked-snaps-hardware-chief-about-the-companys-next-gen-specs-heres-what-i-found-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an interview</a> with Tom’s Guide last summer, Myers called the development process for Specs an “entirely new paradigm” but also discussed the tricky nature of getting its form factor just right. “I don’t want to see people wearing a wire coming out of the back of their head,” he quipped.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s unclear why Cellebrite has changed its approach, which appears contrary to its previous actions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, researchers at The University of Toronto’s The Citizen Lab <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/research/cellebrite-used-on-kenyan-activist-and-politician-boniface-mwangi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published a report</a> alleging the Kenyan government used Cellebrite’s tools to unlock the phone of Boniface Mwangi, a local activist and politician, while he was in police custody. <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/research/from-protest-to-peril-cellebrite-used-against-jordanian-civil-society/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In another report</a> from January, The Citizen Lab accused the Jordanian government of breaking into the phones of several local activists and protesters using Cellebrite’s tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In both investigations, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/citizen-lab-director-warns-cyber-industry-about-us-authoritarian-descent/\">the Citizen Lab</a>, an organization that has investigated abuses of spyware and hacking technologies around the world, based their conclusions on finding traces of a specific application linked to Cellebrite on the victims’ phones. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers said that those traces are a “high confidence” signal that someone used Cellebrite’s unlocking tools on the phones in question, because the same application had been previously found on VirusTotal, a malware repository, and was signed with digital certificates owned by Cellebrite.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other researchers have also <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259893601_Android_Anti-forensics_Modifying_CyanogenMod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">linked the same application</a> to Cellebrite.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do not respond to speculation and encourage any organization with specific, evidence-based concerns to share them with us directly so we can act on them,” Victor Cooper, a spokesperson for Cellebrite, told TechCrunch in an email. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why Cellebrite is acting differently from the Serbia case, Cooper said “the two situations are incomparable,” and that, “high confidence is not direct evidence.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cooper did not respond to multiple follow-up emails asking if Cellebrite would investigate The Citizen Lab’s latest report, and what, if any, differences there are with its case in Serbia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Cellebrite, or other similar companies?

The company has also integrated its latest generative AI models into the app review process, which has helped human reviewers find more complex malicious patterns faster. Google said it plans to increase its AI investments in 2026 to stay ahead of emerging threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Google said it prevented more than 255,000 apps from gaining excessive access to sensitive user data, a figure that’s down from <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2025/01/how-we-kept-google-play-android-app-ecosystem-safe-2024.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1.3 million in 2024</a>. The company also blocked 160 million spam ratings and reviews last year, and prevented an average 0.5-star rating drop for apps targeted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_bomb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">review bombing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Android’s defense system, known as Google Play Protect, identified more than 27 million new malicious apps, and warned users or blocked the app from running. That’s an increase from the 13 million non-Play Store apps identified in 2024 and five million seen in 2023. These increases seem to suggest that bad actors are now more often avoiding the Play Store when targeting users with their malicious apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, it is the fastest-growing unit within the battery recycling and materials startup — a reflection of an AI data center building boom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The evidence of that growth, the company says, can be found at its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/redwood-materials-preps-for-expansion-spree-with-new-rd-center-in-san-francisco/\">R&amp;D lab</a> in San Francisco, which has expanded four-fold into a 55,000-square-foot facility and now employs nearly 100 people. Those are small figures compared to Redwood’s total workforce of 1,200 people and its sprawling campus at its Carson City, Nevada headquarters and another facility near Reno. But its value and recent expansion are tied directly to its burgeoning energy storage that launched in June 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco facility, which opened in April 2025, is where engineers integrate the hardware, software, and power electronics for energy storage systems that power data centers, AI computing, and other large-scale industrial applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/news/redwood-quadruples-san-francisco-r-d-footprint-to-support-redwood-energy-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a blog post </a>Thursday the expansion will support a wave of energy storage deployments related to data centers. The company’s recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/redwood-attracts-google-for-its-425m-series-e-as-ai-power-needs-rise/\">$425 million Series E</a> raise will provide the capital needed to scale the business. Google, a new investor, as well as existing backer Nvidia, joined the round to support Redwood’s energy storage business venture.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI data centers have definitely been a pressing area of focus,” Claire McConnell, vice president of business development told TechCrunch in a recent interview, who added there are other use cases for its systems including supporting renewable projects like solar and wind. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers have been around for decades, but advancements in AI have spurred a building spree and a need for reliable electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What data center developers are seeing is something that they hadn’t experienced before,” McConnell said. “When they’re trying to connect to the grid, they are being told it is going to take five-plus years to get that and at the same time, you’re seeing this massive demand to build more data centers and compete in the AI race.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Redwood Materials was founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics, which was processed and then sold to customers such as Panasonic. The company also expanded into the battery materials business and today produces cathodes for battery cells. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company opened <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/redwood-materials-launches-energy-storage-business-and-its-first-target-is-ai-data-centers/\">Redwood Energy</a> last summer to leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. Redwood Energy’s first customer is Crusoe, a startup that, in 2021, Straubel invested in. Redwood set up an energy storage system that uses old EV batteries that are not yet ready for recycling. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, a company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas — the initial site of the Stargate project. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McConnell said customers that are in the pipeline include hyperscalers — companies that operate massive cloud computing data centers and consume hundreds of megawatts of power — that would far exceed the capacity of its project with Crusoe.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re working on ones in the hundreds of megawatt hours, and we have ones in the pipeline that are multiple gigawatt hours,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Studies suggest that roles where <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/how-artificial-intelligence-impacts-us-labor-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI can automate most tasks will be impacted</a>, though some <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-will-ai-affect-the-global-workforce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">analysts</a> <a href=\"https://time.com/7357476/economics-of-ai-and-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">believe</a> that AI may also create jobs, with the displacement effect only transitional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Shim, CEO of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/read-ai-raises-50m-to-integrate-its-bot-with-slack-email-and-more/\">meeting notetaker and intelligence company Read AI</a>, told TechCrunch at Web Summit Qatar earlier this month that even with the rise of AI tools, it will ultimately be humans who decide the course of action, and their job will be important. He equated the technology with using maps in a car.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there’s always going to be a human in the middle,” Shim said. “I think the job is going to get easier over time. But a good example would be like driving a car. When we first started, you used to have a map. And you’d pull out the map. And you’d go in and say okay I’m driving. I’m deciding what happens. Now everyone uses Waze or Google Maps, and the map is telling you where to go. And you’re just following that order. But you’re the human in the middle who can decide what happens.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shim acknowledged that AI would affect jobs, noting that advertising agencies may lose human roles in favor of automated tools. However, he noted that tech platforms would need jobs to oversee the automation process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Abdullah Asiri, founder of AI-powered consumer support tooling startup <a href=\"https://www.lucidya.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lucidya</a>, said that he believes that AI will replace tasks but not roles. He said that when his company’s clients use Lucidya, customer support agents often take up different roles and responsibilities. He noted that some become supervisors who guide other humans and AI, while some take up relationship-building and business development responsibilities using the time they saved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Read AI’s Shim noted that meeting notetakers have freed up humans from taking notes manually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody here wants to sit down and take meeting notes, but as you start to take away that job, you have a little bit more time to do other things that you can go and focus on. You can send that report a little bit faster, or you can respond back to a customer and actually have better context to make better decisions, versus spending a bunch of time gathering all the information and having little time to make a decision,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-s-internal-use-and-hiring\">AI’s internal use and hiring</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As tech companies like Read AI and Lucidya are increasingly using AI tools, they want to keep their teams lean. Currently, Read AI’s customer service team consists of just five people, who serve millions of monthly users. Shim noted that the company is using AI tools to make a small team more productive and give them more context to help them do their job more quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies are said to be reaping productivity gains. Read AI said that its sales tool helps predict the state of a deal using data from CRM systems like HubSpot and Salesforce. The startup said that it has seen deals worth $200 million approved through that system. Shim said Read AI captures 23% more context with each update, which could be used to evaluate what worked or what didn’t in a lead call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucidya’s Asiri also noted that the company uses AI tools, including Read AI, for meetings and marketing asset creation. He said that the company wants “scale outcomes without scaling headcounts.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The goal for any company is to hire people who are AI native, who are very strong with AI, but we need to be realistic,” Asiri said. “Today, this skill is being developed. You cannot find a lot of people who have very strong AI capabilities, not building AI, but using AI.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091418\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=768,544 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=680,482 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=430,305 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=720,510 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=668,473 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=529,375 529w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=708,502 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Lucidya CEO Abdullah Asiri</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ramsey Cardy/Web Summit Qatar via Sportsfile</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asiri noted that people who would be able to build agents that can help them do their job would be more desirable to hire.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-handling-customer-perception-of-ai\">Handling customer perception of AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shim noted that just a few years ago, many people were hesitant to have AI notetakers in meetings and didn’t understand why a bot was on the call. However, now people are more receptive to notetakers as long as you give them controls around recording, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asiri said that Lucidya discloses to users when it’s using a voice AI to communicate. He said that for users, issue resolution is more important than the fact that an AI bot is handling their calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s all about resolving issues and finding customers’ problems and resolving them,” Asiri said. “As long as the AI agents are actually focusing on that part, customers are happy that their issues are being resolved. The customer really doesn’t care whether it’s fixed by AI or a human, as long as it’s fixed fast and accurately.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature offers suggested questions based on the video, or users can use their remote’s microphone button to ask anything related to the video. For instance, they might ask about recipe ingredients or the background of a song’s lyrics, and receive instant answers without pausing or leaving the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, this feature is available to a select group of users over 18 and supports English, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube first launched this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/youtube-to-test-generative-ai-features-including-a-comments-summarizer-and-conversational-tool/\">conversational AI tool</a> in 2024 to help viewers explore content in greater depth. The expansion to TVs comes as more Americans now access YouTube through their television than ever before. A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/\">Nielsen report</a> from April 2025 found that YouTube accounted for 12.4% of total television audience time, surpassing major platforms like Disney and Netflix.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies are also making significant strides with their conversational AI technologies. Amazon rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/alexa-comes-to-new-fire-tv-devices-with-ai-powered-conversations/\">Alexa+ on Fire TV devices</a>, enabling users to engage in natural conversations and ask Alexa+ for tailored content recommendations, hunt for specific scenes in movies, or even ask questions about actors and filming locations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://support.roku.com/article/208756908#section-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Roku</a> has enhanced its AI voice assistant to handle open-ended questions about movies and shows, such as “What’s this movie about?” or “How scary is it?” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-debuts-its-generative-ai-powered-search-tool/\">Netflix</a> is also testing its AI search experience. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another way YouTube has tried to improve its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/youtubes-latest-updates-are-aimed-at-improving-the-tv-experience/\">TV experience with AI</a> is the recent launch of a feature that automatically enhances to full HD videos uploaded at lower resolutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the company continues to launch other AI features, like a comments summarizer that helps viewers catch up on video discussions and an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/youtube-adds-an-ai-overviews-like-search-results-carousel/\">AI-driven search results carousel</a>. In January, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/youtube-will-soon-let-creators-make-shorts-with-their-own-ai-likeness/\">announced</a> that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using AI-generated versions of their own likeness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, YouTube <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/youtube-finally-launches-a-dedicated-app-for-apple-vision-pro/\">launched</a> a dedicated app for the Apple Vision Pro, too, letting users watch their favorite content on a theater-sized virtual screen in an immersive environment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
