            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With search today so full of AI slop and sites spamming SEO tricks, it’s not unusual for people to append “reddit” to their queries in hopes of finding useful answers to their questions. Google has tried to integrate results from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/google-search-now-queries-reddit-and-quora-in-response-to-open-ended-questions/\">Reddit in its search interface</a>, and taking notice of the trend, Reddit has been experimenting with its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/reddit-hints-at-expanded-ai-powered-search/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">own AI search</a> as well. But the company has loftier ambitions: it wants to become the go-to search engine people use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit’s CEO, Steve Huffman, said as much during its second-quarter conference call on Thursday: “Reddit is one of the few platforms positioned to become a true search destination. We offer something special, a breadth of conversations and knowledge you can’t find anywhere else.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huffman noted that Reddit’s search function has more than 70 million weekly users, and its AI-powered Q&amp;A product, Reddit Answers, is now used by 6 million people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit Answers is currently available in a dozen countries, and the company plans to expand it globally as well as give it prominent placement in the site’s interface. The company eventually wants to unify the core search function with Reddit Answers, and redesign its app to have the search box be more prominently visible. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re unifying those [Reddit search and Reddit Answers] into a single search experience, and we’re gonna bring that front and center in the app. So, whether you’re a new user opening the app for the first time or a returning user opening the app, that search box will be present immediately,” Huffman said on the call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People are increasingly being presented chat-styled search interfaces from products like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google’s new AI mode. Reddit understandably believes that tapping its rich trove of user posts and comments to help people find answers will help make its search function more useful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit reported a positive second quarter, with revenue jumping 78% to $500 million from a year earlier. The company launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/reddit-revenue-soars-as-it-bets-on-ai-and-advertising/\">two new ad tools</a>, which let marketers use Reddit data to spot trends, and leverage comments about brands in their campaigns.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, its years of research and development with the Department of Defense may be paying off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company on Thursday said it had signed an agreement with defense contractor L3Harris Technologies to “explore opportunities” to develop a new aircraft class — specifically, a gas-turbine hybrid vertical take-off and landing aircraft that can fly autonomously — for defense applications.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The gas-turbine hybrid VTOL will be based on Joby’s current S4 aircraft platform. The company has focused on developing the S4 with an all-electric powertrain, but it last year demonstrated under government contract a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/11/joby-aviation-is-betting-on-hydrogen-electric-aircraft-for-regional-flight/\">hydrogen-electric hybrid version</a> that flew 521 miles — more than two times farther than its battery electric prototype.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agreement with L3Harris is exploratory, but the hope is that upcoming flights tests and operational demonstrations will lead to a military contract with the DoD. Joby said flight testing will start this fall, and operational demonstrations are expected in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joby has spent years developing and seeking Type 1 certification from the Federal Aviation Administration for its all-electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, which will be used to shuttle passengers short distances in urban areas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also worked with the DoD at the development stage for nearly a decade. Through that relationship, Joby homed in on what it would take to get to the “finish line” with the DoD, Joby executive chairman Paul Sciarra told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One was that range was especially important,” he said. “We knew we had to make that shift.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sciarra added it was also important to demonstrate the so-called “missionization of its platform” — how its aircraft could be combined with the right sensors, autonomy, communications and payload to provide a clear use case for the DoD.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have two choices: either build a bunch of this stuff ourselves, or find an incredible partner that already has a deep understanding of those use cases and a ton of proven technology,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s where L3Harris comes in. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jon Rambeau, president of Integrated Mission Systems at L3Harris, said the new vertical lift technology will enable long-range, crewed-uncrewed teaming for a range of missions. In this case, the gas-turbine hybrid VTOL aircraft could be used for low-altitude support missions, which could include contested logistics, electronic warfare, and counter unmanned aircraft systems, or C-UAS, Sciarra said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These systems spawn AI multiple agents to tackle a question in parallel, a process that uses significantly more computational resources than a single agent, but tends to result in better answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google used a variation of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/openai-and-google-outdo-the-mathletes-but-not-each-other/\">score a gold medal</a> at this year’s International Math Olympiad (IMO).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, the company says it is releasing the model it used at the IMO to a select group of mathematicians and academics. Google says this AI model “takes hours to reason,” instead of seconds or minutes like most consumer-facing AI models. The company hopes the IMO model will enhance research efforts, and aims to get feedback on how to improve the multi-agent system for academic use cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google notes that the Gemini 2.5 Deep Think model is a significant improvement over what it announced at I/O. The company also claims to have developed “novel reinforcement learning techniques” to encourage Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to make better use of its reasoning paths.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Deep Think can help people tackle problems that require creativity, strategic planning and making improvements step-by-step,” said Google in a blog post shared with TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says Gemini 2.5 Deep Think achieves state-of-the-art performance on Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) — a challenging test measuring AI’s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions across math, humanities, and science. Google claims its model scored 34.8% on HLE (without tools), compared to xAI’s Grok 4, which scored 25.4%, and OpenAI’s o3, which scored 20.3%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google also says Gemini 2.5 Deep Think outperforms AI models from OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic on LiveCodeBench6, a challenging test of competitive coding tasks. Google’s model scored 87.6%, whereas Grok 4 scored 79%, and OpenAI’s o3 scored 72%.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?w=580\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033173\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png 1001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=128,150 128w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=256,300 256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=768,900 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=580,680 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=367,430 367w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=614,720 614w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=683,800 683w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=570,668 570w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=320,375 320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=527,617 527w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=453,531 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?resize=43,50 43w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Benchmark scores.

That’s Amazon, though, which explains why it has been deployed in Amazon stores and more than 500 Whole Foods Market stores in the U.S., but only 150 third-party locations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, fintech startups like Latvia’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.handwave.com/\">Handwave</a> are stepping onto the field, aiming to provide third-party retailers with a similar but independent solution for faster checkout while leveraging the giant’s role in popularizing biometric payments in the West. (China has already begun adopting biometric palm payments, with Tencent working to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/tech/tencent-palm-scanning-service-china-intl-hnk\">bring its Weixin Palm Pay service into mainstream use</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Apple’s Face ID, palm scanning uses more than static images: it analyzes palm vein patterns and also verifies that the user is physically present when they hover their hand over the scanner. This method works for secure contactless payments and also applies to broader identity verification scenarios — with players like Keyo also supporting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/10/with-7m-raised-keyo-launches-a-biometric-palm-verification-network/\">secure building access and other applications</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In contrast, Handwave is focusing specifically on retail — and since it doesn’t own stores like Amazon, it had to seek partners, which required having a product. Three years in, and now with its own hardware and software, the Latvian startup is preparing for market pilots that will deploy its palm scanning devices at retail stores. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merchants who deploy the startup’s tech would pay a transaction fee that Handwave claims will be on par with or lower than standard payments. According to Handwave, faster and cheaper checkouts could reduce costs. But unlike some cost-cutting measures, this solution aims to make things easier for customers — with the promise of no cards, no apps, no fingerprint scanners, and no facial scans — even for age verification and loyalty programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Handwave’s cofounders, CEO Janis Stirna and Sandis Osmanis-Usmanis, previously worked for one of the world’s largest global payment providers, Worldline. Despite this connection, the team aims to build a wide ecosystem. “Our plan is to collaborate with any financial institution or acquiring bank,” Stirna told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has only partnered with a handful of financial institutions so far, “but very big ones, especially in Europe,” Stirna said. This summer, the startup signed an agreement with Visa that could speed up the deployment of Handwave’s solution in any country, according to its chief revenue officer, Oskars Laksevics.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Handwave has its eyes on the U.S. market as well, Laksevics believes that it can be an advantage to start out in the European Union — “the strictest market in the world” — and demonstrate compliance there before expanding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being an independent European player could also help the startup keep an edge if or when Amazon decides to more aggressively offer Amazon One to third parties; or if JP Morgan rolls out <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/payments/payments-unbound/magazine/articles/future-payments-experiences-sports-fans\">its own palm payment experiment</a> further. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup can rely also on other arguments, including pricing. After financial partners told Handwave its devices need to be able to compete on price, the startup developed its own hardware and algorithms making them cheaper than others, Stirna said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being based in Riga also enabled Handwave to operate with limited capital. The startup told TechCrunch its R&amp;D process was funded through bootstrapping, a $780,000 angel investment round, and $267,000 in non-equity funding.

The round was led by Peak XV’s Surge (formerly Sequoia India &amp; SEA), with participation from Alpha Intelligence Capital, FEBE, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2018 by engineers Akanksha Jagwani (CTO) and Avni Agarwal (CEO), SixSense aims to address a fundamental challenge in semiconductor manufacturing: converting raw production data, from defect images to equipment signals, into real-time insights that help factories prevent quality issues and improve yield.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the sheer volume of data generated on the fab floor, what stood out to the co-founders was a surprising lack of real-time intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Akanksha brings a deep understanding of manufacturing, quality control, and software automation through her experience building automation solutions for manufacturers like Hyundai Motors and GE and led product development at startups like Embibe. Agarwal adds technical experience from her time at Visa, where she built large-scale data analytics systems, some of which were later protected as trade secrets. A skilled coder with a strong background in mathematics, she had long been interested in applying AI to traditional industries beyond fintech.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?w=345\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033008\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg 650w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=152,300 152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=345,680 345w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=609,1200 609w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=218,430 218w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=366,720 366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=457,900 457w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=406,800 406w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=339,668 339w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=190,375 190w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=313,617 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=270,531 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-29-at-15.59.51-2-1.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>SixSense</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Together, the duo evaluated sectors from aviation to automotive before landing on semiconductors. Despite the semiconductor industry’s reputation for precision, inspection processes remain largely manual and fragmented, Agarwal told TechCrunch. After speaking with more than 50 engineers, it became clear there’s significant room to modernize how quality checks are done, she added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fabs today are filled with dashboards, SPC charts, and inline inspection systems, but most only display data without further analysis, Agarwal said. “The burden of using it for decision-making still falls on engineers: [they must] spot patterns, investigate anomalies, and trace root causes. That’s time-consuming, subjective, and doesn’t scale well with increasing process complexity.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SixSense provides engineers with early warnings to address potential issues before they escalate with capabilities such as defect detection, root cause analysis, and failure prediction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SixSense’s platform is also specifically designed to be used by process engineers rather than data scientists, Agarwal said. “Process engineers can fine-tune models using their own fab data, deploy them in under two days, and trust the results — all without writing a single line of code. That’s what makes the platform both powerful and practical.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The competitive landscape includes in-house engineering teams using tools like Cognex and Halcon, inspection equipment makers integrating AI into their systems, and startups including Landing.ai and Robovision.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SixSense’s AI platform is already in use at major semiconductor manufacturers like GlobalFoundries and JCET, with more than 100 million chips processed to date. Customers have reported up to 30% faster production cycles, a 1-2% boost in yield, and a 90% reduction in manual inspection work, the founders said. The system is compatible with inspection equipment that covers over 60% of the global market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our target customers are large-scale chipmakers — including foundries, outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (OSATs), and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs),” Agarwal said. “We’re already working with fabs in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Israel, and are now expanding into the U.S.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geopolitical tensions, especially between the U.S. and China, are reshaping where chips are made, driving new manufacturing investments across the globe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing fabs and OSATs expand aggressively in Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, India, and the U.S. — and that’s a tailwind for us. Why? Because we’re already based in the region, and many of these new facilities are starting fresh — without legacy systems weighing them down. That makes them far more open to AI-native approaches like ours from day one,” Agarwal told TechCrunch. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

People do a lot of shopping [with Alexa+]; it’s a delightful shopping experience that will keep getting better,” said Jassy on the call with investors and Wall Street analysts. “I think over time, there will be opportunities, as people are engaging in more multi-turn conversations, to have advertising play a role to help people find discovery, and also as a lever to drive revenue.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says it has rolled out Alexa+ to millions of customers, part of an effort to make its legacy digital assistant capable of agentic behaviors and more natural to talk to. Alexa+ is Amazon’s answer to generative AI voice assistants from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/17/openais-new-voice-mode-let-me-talk-with-my-phone-not-to-it/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/gemini-live-first-look-better-than-talking-to-siri-but-worse-than-id-like/\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/perplexity-ios-voice-assistant-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Perplexity</a> that have made legacy systems feel outdated. However, the business models behind generative AI products remain unclear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon has made Alexa+ free for Prime customers (who pay $14.99 a month) and added a $20-a-month subscription tier for Alexa+ on its own. Jassy suggested on Thursday that Alexa+ could eventually include subscription tiers beyond what’s available today — perhaps an ad-free tier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Up until now, ads have only appeared in Alexa in limited ways. Users may occasionally see a visual ad on Amazon’s smart display device, the Echo Show, or hear a pre-recorded ad in between songs on one of Alexa’s smart speakers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Jassy’s description of an AI-generated ad that Alexa+ delivers in a multistep conversation, which could help users find new products, is uncharted territory for Amazon and the broader tech industry. Marketers have expressed interest in advertising in AI chatbots, and <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/amazon-launches-alexa-and-marketers-want-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">specifically Alexa+</a>, but exactly how remains unclear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s competitors in the AI space seem to think advertising is a promising business model for generative AI, too. Google is exploring how to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/google-is-bringing-ads-to-ai-mode/\">infuse ads </a>into its AI-powered search experience, AI mode. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he’s open to a “<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-openai-ceo-sam-altman-about-building-a-consumer-tech-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tasteful”</a> form of advertising in ChatGPT.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon is spending a fortune to catch up in the AI race. In the second quarter of 2025, Amazon’s capital expenditures rose to $31.4 billion, up 90% from the same period last year. A large part of that increased spending is to develop Amazon’s in-house AI chips and build out data centers to support AI models. While the revenue of Amazon’s cloud business, AWS, grew 18% in the second quarter, the company likely needs to generate new business to pay for these investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jassy is betting that users will talk to Alexa+ more than Alexa, which could drive more advertising and more shopping on Amazon.com. However, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/705808/amazon-alexa-plus-first-look\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">early reviews </a>of Alexa+ have been mixed. Amazon has reportedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/ai-alexa-and-ai-siri-face-bugs-and-delays/\">struggled to ship</a> some of Alexa+’s more complicated features, and the rollout has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/over-a-million-people-now-have-access-to-the-gen-ai-powered-alexa/\">slower than many expected</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a lot to figure out before Amazon puts ads in Alexa+. Like most AI models, Alexa+ is not immune to hallucinations. Before advertisers agree to make Alexa+ a spokesperson for their products, Amazon may have to come up with some ways to ensure that its AI will not offer false advertising for a product.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jassy seems enthusiastic about making advertising a larger part of Amazon business. Amazon’s advertising revenue went up 22% in the second quarter, compared to the same period last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Delivering ads in AI chatbot conversations may also raise privacy concerns. People tend to talk more with AI chatbots compared to deterministic assistants, like the traditional Alexa and Siri products. As a result, generative AI chatbots tend to collect more information on users. Some users might be unsettled by having that information sold to advertisers and having ads appear in their natural language conversations with AI.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Apple incurred about $800 million of tariff-related costs for the June quarter, less <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/apple-ceo-tim-cook-says-tariffs-to-add-900m-in-costs-in-q3/\">than the $900 million estimate </a>the company shared in May. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cook said most of the tariffs levied against Apple stem from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Earlier this year, and amid a brewing trade war, the U.S. government and China agreed to a 30% tariff <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/us-and-china-agree-to-slash-tariffs-for-90-days.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on imports from China</a>. That trade agreement, which reduced “reciprocal” tariffs from 125% to 10% (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/china-says-its-willing-to-cooperate-with-the-us-on-fentanyl.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plus the 20% duty</a> against China related to fentanyl), stands until August 12. <br><br>While sales growth suggests fear of tariffs helped fuel sales, Cook downplayed the “pull forward” effect, noting that consumers were more motivated by the “strength of the product.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you look at iPhone, the 16 family grew double digits, as opposed to the 15 family from the year-ago quarter,” Cook said on the call. “And so we did set an upgrade record … I think it directly is because of the strength of the product.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sales of the iPhone rose 13% year-over-year and generated <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/apple-has-now-sold-three-billion-iphones/\">$44.5 billion in revenue</a> — nearly half of the entire company’s total revenue this quarter, which reached $94 billion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, tariffs have had an impact and may continue to do so, even if Apple shifts its manufacturing strategy to countries with lower tariffs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple devices are mainly manufactured in India, China, and Vietnam. Nearly half the iPhones sold in the U.S. are produced in India, while Macs, iPads, and watches bound for U.S. customers are made in Vietnam. Both India and Vietnam are subjected to tariffs of 25% and 20%, respectively. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">President Trump previously expressed his dismay at Apple shifting its supply chain focus more toward India, threatening the company with a 25% tariff unless Apple moved iPhone production to the U.S. <br><br>Cook reiterated Apple’s commitment to the U.S. in Thursday’s investors call, saying the company has committed <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$500 billion in investments</a> to the U.S. over the next four years, building chips and semiconductors across the country.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The results revealed that the majority of Reddit’s revenue continues to come from ads, which brought in $465 million, representing 93% of the company’s total revenue. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, Reddit launched two new features for advertisers: Reddit Insights, a tool that leverages the billions of posts and comments on the platform to spot trends and offer real-time insights for campaign strategies, and Conversation Summary Add-ons, which let advertisers include Reddit user discussions directly in ads, showing public opinions about products or brands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also saw growth in its “other revenue” category, which includes its data licensing business — meaning its deals with AI providers for access to its data. Reddit said the category jumped 24% year-over-year to $35 million, up from $28.1 million in the same period a year prior. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit has already established content licensing agreements with major players in AI, including Google and OpenAI. Although these deals are still new, the results from the second quarter point out a steady income stream that has significant potential for the long haul.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another key AI-powered feature is the Reddit Answers tool, which launched in December. This tool, which offers answers in a conversational interface, has attracted 6 million weekly users, a considerable jump from <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/380862485/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1 million</a> users in the previous quarter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/380862485/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Q2-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">letter to shareholders</a>, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the platform is working to integrate the tool “more deeply into the core search experience” to make “search a central feature across Reddit.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

So perhaps a bigger cause for celebration at Apple is that its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iPhone sales were stronger</a> this quarter than expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sales of the iPhone, Apple’s most popular product, are up 13% year-over-year, generating $44.6 billion in revenue, according to information shared on the earnings call. That’s nearly half of the entire company’s <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000071/a8-kex991q3202506282025.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">total revenue</a> this quarter, which reached $94 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This uptick in iPhone sales might be temporary, though.

We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments,” CEO Tim Cook said on the Q3 2025 earnings call with investors. “Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that’s at the heart of our AI strategy,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cook expanded on those comments on the call, noting that Apple was “reallocating a fair number of people” to focus on AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a great, great team and we’re putting all of our energy behind it,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI investments are also driving increased CapEx spending, which was up year-to-date, the company said. However, Apple pointed out that it still employed a hybrid model where it relies on third parties to make capital investments, which is why the figure won’t grow exponentially. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahead of its call, the company shared in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/apple-aapl-q3-earnings-report-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC</a> that it’s open to M&amp;A to accelerate its roadmap. The company told the outlet that it has already acquired seven companies this year. None was “huge” in terms of dollar amount, Cook said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the call, he added that Apple was making acquisitions at the rate of one every several weeks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/10/ai-apple-stock-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">criticized</a> for having been caught off guard by the AI era; it has announced a number of AI features that it has, so far, <a href=\"https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/siriously-delayed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">failed</a> to ship. The company was even accused of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTLk53h7u_k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">showing off an improved AI-powered version of Siri</a> that wasn’t close to being ready to launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/apple-executives-say-new-ai-powered-siri-wasnt-demoware-it-just-wasnt-ready-to-ship/#:~:text=Staff-,Apple%20executives%20say%20new%20AI%2Dpowered%20Siri%20wasn't%20',wasn't%20ready%20to%20ship&amp;text=In%20a%20handful%20of%20interviews,despite%20having%20yet%20to%20launch.\">Apple has defended itself</a> by saying that it doesn’t need to rush — that launching the wrong features or the wrong products just to be first would be a mistake. That’s especially true if those products don’t work as promised.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Apple says it has launched more than 20 Apple Intelligence features, including visual intelligence, cleanup, and writing tools. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Later this year, Apple plans to launch AI features like live translation and an AI-powered workout buddy, but the more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/ai-powered-more-personalized-siri-is-delayed/\">personalized Siri’s improvements have been delayed</a> to 2026. On the call with investors, Cook said the company was “making good progress” on the Siri update. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also shared his thoughts on how AI may impact the iPhone business if new hardware were to emerge. For instance, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg earlier this week suggested that AI glasses would be the form factor for interacting with the new technology, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-people-without-ai-glasses-will-be-at-a-disadvantage-in-the-future/\">those without them would be left behind</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cook, naturally, disagreed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s difficult to see a world where iPhone’s not living in it,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that we are not thinking about other things, as well, but I think that the [AI] devices are likely to be complementary devices, not substitutions.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec declined to answer a question about which AI technologies it believed would ultimately be commoditized, saying that would give away part of its strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple delivered better-than-expected iPhone sales and record revenue in Q3, which <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-q3-earnings-aapl-stock-price-iphone-demand-ai-tariffs-2025-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">saw its stock pop</a> in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated after initial publication with more details from the earnings call. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This would lead to one of his signature seed investments, in a startup called Figma.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/figmas-stock-soars-in-its-highly-anticipated-ipo-market-cap-instantly-hits-45b/\">Figma went public with the stock popping</a> from the $33 IPO opening price to close at $115.50 and a $47 billion market cap. And Griffith could not be more effusive in his praise for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You go to one of these user conferences and you’re like, there’s 15,000 people here and 5,000 have Figma tattoos,” Griffith smiled. From the earliest days, the founders of this company that offers software for designers had “a fervent desire to win and deliver and redefine this ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet in 2013 at that first meeting, co-founders Dylan Field and Evan Wallace were untested. And at that point, so was Iconiq. It was known then as the very secretive wealth management firm for many of Silicon Valley’s richest tech moguls, like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Figma, however, already had a champion: Field had been an intern at LinkedIn under its then CEO Jeff Weiner. Weiner was an angel investor (and bought more <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-series-c/\">stock at later rounds</a>, too) and introduced Field to Griffith.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We got connected to Figma before we had an early fund, before we had any venture fund,” Griffith told TechCrunch. The investor remembers trekking out to meet the founders. “It was like two guys and the dog in an apartment in Palo Alto, and they were working on these newfangled graphics and design capability in a browser.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The demo showed how light could be manipulated when editing a photo in a browser. At the time, browser-based design software, based on WebGL, was revolutionary. Tech giant Adobe had the graphics design market locked up with its desktop software. “I thought it was insane,” Griffith recalled.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea was so unproven Alexis Ohanian, who was investing out of his then firm Initialized, passed on Figma when he saw the product years later in 2016, he noted in <a href=\"https://x.com/alexisohanian/status/1950221481813622997\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a tweet this week</a>. Ohanian called Figma a member of his “embarrassing miss-list.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Griffith wrote a check. Seed shares, by the way, were priced at $0.0878 each, Figma <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025036090/figmas-1a2.htm\">disclosed</a> in its S-1A. And Griffith wrote more checks as Figma raised additional rounds. The company raised a total of about $332 million in venture funding through 2024, PitchBook estimates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We invested in the seed. We invested in the Series A. We invested further. We did some secondary and we also invested more meaningfully a year ago,” Griffith said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iconiq did not wind up owning at least 5% of the company, a bar that would require Figma to publicly disclose the size of its stake. But it owns enough that the IPO will be celebrated at the Iconiq offices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the ways that we celebrate is we guess what the closing day stock price is going to be on the first day. It’s a prediction contest around the firm,” Griffith said. “There are some good prizes and rewards.” If someone nails that number, they could wind up with a healthy cash bonus or even something like a trip to Hawaii. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the odd part of this IPO, Griffith has some insight. Most of the stock sold was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/figmas-ipo-price-hit-a-19-3b-valuation-out-of-the-gate/\">from investors’ stakes</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/figmas-dylan-field-will-cash-out-about-60m-in-ipo-with-index-kleiner-greylock-sequoia-all-selling-too/\">including Field’s</a>, rather than new shares issued by the company, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it’s very generous that existing investors are willing to sell as much to create enough supply for this IPO,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Figma’s fundamentals are so solid that the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/figma-s-1-2-billion-ipo-approaching-40-times-oversubscribed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IPO was 40 times oversubscribed</a>, according to Bloomberg, meaning far more investors wanted shares than the supply available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That can be almost as problematic as investor disinterest, Griffith explained. The largest institutional investors won’t bother with an IPO where they can’t trade hundreds of millions’ worth of shares, he said. And if an IPO doesn’t float enough shares, prices of available shares could become artificially inflated, meaning the company won’t be properly valued. Should prices decline after opening day, the company could be artificially devalued as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Figma’s existing shareholders didn’t really want to sell shares at $33, Griffith said. “We have been with this business since 2015, and we haven’t sold a share. And we are going to be meaningful buyers in the IPO,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Griffith emphasized that for Figma, IPO day is just a milestone and not an end. “I met a young, 19-year-old Dylan, and we forged a partnership,” he said. He describes himself as “proud” of seeing Field, Figma’s CEO, “continue to just mature and grow, but have the same vision, morals, authenticity.“</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, he says he’ll be spending Figma’s IPO day “meeting with the next generation of founders.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

OpenAI holds the second-largest market share by usage among enterprises, with 25%.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The figure marks a strong reversal from even just a couple of years ago. Since 2023, OpenAI has seen its market share among enterprises decline sharply, according to the report, as Anthropic’s has steadily risen over the same timeframe. OpenAI held 50% of the enterprise market share by usage just two years ago while Anthropic had 12%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has seen enterprise usage for its models increase over the last few years as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has an even larger market share when it comes to coding, with 42% of the enterprise market share, the largest market share by a wide margin. Enterprise usage of Anthropic’s AI models are more than double OpenAI’s, when it comes to coding, which garnered 21% of overall market share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s release of its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model in June 2024 is what laid the foundation for the company’s surge in usage, according to the report. The release of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/anthropic-launches-a-new-ai-model-that-thinks-as-long-as-you-want/\">Claude 3.7 Sonnet </a> in February 2025 only accelerated that momentum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The findings from Menlo Ventures align with anecdotal chatter in the industry, which suggested that enterprise and startup developers preferred Claude over OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meanwhile, OpenAI has a strong foothold on the consumer side of the house. The company reported last week that its users send more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/chatgpt-users-send-2-5-billion-prompts-a-day/\">2.5 billion prompts</a> to ChatGPT a day.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Menlo Ventures report found enterprises prefer closed models, which Anthropic and OpenAI use. More than half of enterprises replied that they don’t use open source models at all. Only 13% of enterprise daily workloads use open source models as of mid-year 2025, down from 19% at the beginning of the year. Meta still maintains dominance in the open source market.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In a recent interview, Roth worried about the lack of moderation tools available to the fediverse — the open social web that includes apps like Mastodon, Threads, Pixelfed, and others, as well as other open platforms like Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also reminisced about key moments in Trust and Safety at Twitter, like its decision to ban President Trump from the platform, the misinformation spread by Russian bot farms, and how Twitter’s own users, including CEO Jack Dorsey, fell prey to bots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the podcast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_cXVrkyVE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revolution.social with @Rabble</a>, Roth pointed out that the efforts at building more democratically run online communities across the open social web are also those that have the fewest resources when it comes to moderation tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“…looking at Mastodon, looking at other services based on ActivityPub [protocol], looking at Bluesky in its earliest days, and then looking at Threads as Meta started to develop it, what we saw was that a lot of the services that were leaning the hardest into community-based control gave their communities the least technical tools to be able to administer their policies,” Roth said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Yoel Roth on Banning Trump, Battling Bots &amp; the Difficult Job of Trust &amp; Safety\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yS_cXVrkyVE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also saw a “pretty big backslide” on the open social web when it came to the transparency and decision legitimacy that Twitter once had. While, arguably, many at the time disagreed with Twitter’s decision to ban Trump, the company explained its rationale for doing so. Now, social media providers are so concerned about preventing bad actors from gaming them that they rarely explain themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, on many open social platforms, users wouldn’t receive a notice about their banned posts, and their posts would just vanish — there wasn’t even an indication to others that the post used to exist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t blame startups for being startups, or new pieces of software for lacking all the bells and whistles, but if the whole point of the project was increasing democratic legitimacy of governance, and what we’ve done is take a step back on governance, then, has this actually worked at all?” Roth wonders.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-economics-of-moderation\">The economics of moderation</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also brought up the issues around the economics of moderation and how the federated approach hasn’t yet been sustainable on this front. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, an organization called IFTAS (Independent Federated Trust &amp; Safety) had been working to build moderation tools for the fediverse, including providing the fediverse with access to tools to combat CSAM, but it ran out of money and <a href=\"https://about.iftas.org/2025/03/03/iftas-service-shutdowns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">had to shut down many</a> of its projects earlier in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We saw it coming two years ago. IFTAS saw it coming. Everybody who’s been working in this space is largely volunteering their time and efforts, and that only goes so far, because at some point, people have families and need to pay bills, and compute costs stack up if you need to run ML models to detect certain types of bad content,” he explained. “It just all gets expensive, and the economics of this federated approach to trust and safety never quite added up. And in my opinion, still don’t.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky, meanwhile, has chosen to employ moderators and hire in trust and safety, but it limits itself to the moderation of its own app. Plus, they’re providing tools that let people customize their own moderation preferences. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re doing this work at scale. There’s obviously room for improvement. I’d love to see them be a bit more transparent. But, fundamentally, they’re doing the right stuff,” Roth said. However, as the service further decentralizes, Bluesky will face questions about when it is the responsibility to protect the individual over the needs of the community, he notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, with doxxing, it’s possible that someone wouldn’t see that their personal information was being spread online because of how they configured their moderation tools. But it should still be someone’s responsibility to enforce those protections, even if the user isn’t on the main Bluesky app. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-to-draw-the-line-on-privacy\">Where to draw the line on privacy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another issue facing the fediverse is that the decision to favor privacy can thwart moderation attempts. While Twitter tried not to store personal data it didn’t need to, it still collected things like the IP address of the user, when they accessed the service, device identifiers, and more. These helped the company when it needed to do forensic analysis of something like a Russian troll farm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fediverse admins, meanwhile, may not even be collecting the necessary logs or won’t view them if they think it’s a violation of user privacy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the reality is that without data, it’s harder to determine who’s really a bot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roth offered a few examples of this from his Twitter days, noting how it became a trend for users to reply “bot” to anyone they disagreed with. He says that he initially set up an alert and reviewed all these posts manually, examining hundreds of instances of “bot” accusations, and nobody was ever right. Even Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey fell victim, retweeting posts <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.x.com/common-thread/en/topics/stories/2021/four-truths-about-bots\">from a Russian actor who claimed to be Crystal Johnson</a>, a Black woman from New York.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The CEO of the company liked this content, amplified it, and had no way of knowing as a user that Crystal Johnson was actually a Russian troll,” Roth said. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-role-of-ai\">The role of AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One timely topic of discussion was how AI was changing the landscape. Roth referenced recent research from Stanford that found that, in a political context, large language models (LLMs) could even be more convincing than humans when properly tuned. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means a solution that relies only on content analysis itself isn’t enough. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, companies need to track other behavioral signals — like if some entity is creating multiple accounts, using automation to post, or posting at weird times of day that correspond to different time zones, he suggested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are behavioral signals that are latent even in really convincing content. And I think that’s where you have to start this,” Roth said. “If you’re starting with the content, you’re in an arms race against leading AI models and you’ve already lost.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company says this was a short-lived experiment that ultimately “introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn’t intend to.” The original story follows.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a strange glimpse into the human mind: If you <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/olivermolander_artificialintelligence-activity-7356621639284862976-jlEL/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABiDiCIBqB3Hlz-FnttvYmkM02-OgyLf_Qc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filter search results</a> on Google, Bing, and other search engines to only include URLs from the domain “https://chatgpt.com/share,” you can find strangers’ conversations with ChatGPT.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sometimes, these shared conversation links are pretty dull — people ask for help <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/011b8169-b122-45d9-9e94-ac14af26f424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">renovating their bathroom</a>, understanding <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/6fb219ae-cf5e-486f-9e40-35a653ebe7a4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">astrophysics</a>, and finding <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/670ee5a0-28b4-8001-bb3f-4baaab45cdaf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recipe ideas</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another case, one user asks ChatGPT to rewrite their resume for a particular job application (judging by this person’s LinkedIn, which was easy to find based on the details in the chat log, they did not get the job). Someone else is asking questions that sound like they came out of an incel forum. Another person asks the snarky, hostile AI assistant if they can <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/67ed5fe2-fff8-8008-b106-952343a5863a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">microwave a metal fork</a> (for the record: no), but they continue to ask the AI increasingly absurd and trollish questions, eventually leading it to create a guide called “How to Use a Microwave Without Summoning Satan: A Beginner’s Guide.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT does not make these conversations public by default. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A conversation would be appended with a “/share” URL only if the user deliberately clicks the “share” button on their own chat and then clicks a second “create link” button. The service also declares that “your name, custom instructions, and any messages you add after sharing stay private.” After clicking through to create a link, users can toggle whether or not they want that link to be discoverable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, users may not anticipate that other search engines will index their shared ChatGPT links, potentially betraying personal information (my apologies to the person whose LinkedIn I discovered).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though unintentional, this is a norm that was established in part by Google. When people share public links to files from Google Drive, such as documents with the “Anyone with link can view” setting, Google may index them in Search. However, Google generally does not surface links to Drive documents that have not been publicly posted on the web — for example, a document may appear in search if it is linked on a trusted website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to ChatGPT, these chats were indexed as part of an experiment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“ChatGPT chats are not public unless you choose to share them,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’ve been testing ways to make it easier to share helpful conversations, while keeping users in control, and we recently ended an experiment to have chats appear in search engine results if you explicitly opted in when sharing.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While search engines like Google control the algorithms that determine what content gets surface for search terms, the search engines themselves cannot control what gets indexed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Neither Google nor any other search engine controls what pages are made public on the web,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Publishers of these pages have full control over whether they are indexed by search engines.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated, 7/31/25, 5:30 pm ET with comment and additional context from OpenAI.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The trend started on “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_We_Dating_The_Same_Guy%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Are we dating the same guy?”-style</a> Facebook Groups, where women would post screenshots of potential dates’ profiles to find out if they were already seeing someone else.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3032793\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg 1630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=680,473 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=1200,835 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=1280,891 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=430,299 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=720,501 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=900,626 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=800,557 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=1536,1069 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=668,465 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=539,375 539w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=887,617 887w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=708,493 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/are-we-dating-the-same-guy.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot of Facebook by TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same concept also powers the newly viral dating advice app <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/dating-safety-app-tea-breached-exposing-72000-user-images/\">Tea</a>, which claims to have 1.6 million users. Its sudden popularity has fueled online debate, where men accuse women of doxxing them, and women point to the necessity of sharing these warnings with others. After all, dating apps largely ignored serious safety concerns, like background checks, according to a 2019 <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one\">investigative report by </a><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ProPublica</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one\"> and Columbia Journalism Investigations</a>, which highlighted the presence of sexual predators on Match-owned dating apps.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet the solutions are often as bad as the problems they try to fix. Tea, for example, has seen its security breached twice, with <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/women-dating-safety-app-tea-breached-users-ids-posted-to-4chan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">users’ selfies, private messages, and government IDs shared to 4chan</a>, a notorious web forum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not surprising, then, that some are giving up online dating altogether.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-new-meeting-online\">The new “meeting online”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rothfels didn’t mean to fall in love with a guy from a Facebook meme group who lived in another country. The internet had other plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I always thought he was hot,” Rothfels concedes. “I liked his mustache.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/weird-facebook-post-ironic-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">absurdist communities</a>, mostly populated with quick-witted, offbeat college students, often had thousands of members. Rothfels and her husband, Owen, had only interacted in passing, but she knew that they had similar senses of humor and political views — otherwise, they wouldn’t have both spent so much time in these online spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owen lived in Minneapolis, and she lived in Toronto, so she never acted on her idle crush. Then one morning in 2019, while she was hungover in bed after a party, she saw that Owen had posted on Instagram about the folk musician Woody Guthrie.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I replied saying that I’m related to Woody Guthrie, which is true — distantly — and he replied saying, ‘Marry me,’” she said. “That exchange kind of kicked off us talking constantly for the next week … We basically never stopped messaging each other.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though their connection blossomed beyond their shared interest in “elaborate dadaist memes,” the whimsical foundation of their relationship had proven to be the ultimate icebreaker.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The knowledge that we had both spent a lot of time online making these dumb memes made it less daunting,” Rothfels said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elsewhere, demand for alternative ways to meet people is <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/singles-school-swapping-apps-real-life-dating/story?id=113454495\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growing</a>, like going to in-person <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w822n7827o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">speed dating</a> events or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-single-tired-of-dating-apps-alternative-2025-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mixers</a>, turning to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/style/seven-days-personals-vermont.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">older methods like personal ads</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/65865/1/i-tried-breeze-the-dating-app-that-takes-online-dating-offline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">trying apps for offline dating</a>, or even joining running clubs, which have become a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/running-clubs-are-the-new-dating-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">weirdly popular</a> avenue for dating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But like Rothfels, people are finding love in unexpected places — the forums and sites they use to pass idle time online, as opposed to those dedicated to online dating. There, they get to know each other in shared social settings, where the specter of possible romance doesn’t haunt each of their interactions from the first message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rudy, a 54-year-old who had never used traditional dating apps, met his wife by chance in an erotic pen pals forum on Reddit, where their identities were obscured by their personas of mythical creatures.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright\"><blockquote><p>I think that Twitter has changed how we communicate and has definitely changed how we relate to other people … on Twitter, you could be dropping lore every five seconds.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a great deal of safety thrown into those interactions, at least on Reddit,” Rudy (using a pseudonym) told TechCrunch. “Throwaway Reddit accounts are effectively anonymous.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within their fantastical world, they wrote hundreds of thousands of words to each other, solely because they found it fun. Over the course of a year and a half, their fictional correspondence slowly became more real.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We explained it as a creative writing forum,” Rudy said. “My family is aware that I met her [online]; they’re just not aware that it was explicitly pornographic, ‘Cthulhu mythos’ stuff.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Explicit flirtations aside, their creative connection allowed them to get to know each other on a deeper level. Over time, they revealed details about their real lives, and they decided to meet in person. Soon, the woman who became Rudy’s wife moved to the U.S. to be with him.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My wife’s wit and cleverness … She makes me laugh more than anybody, and I believe it’s the same for her,” Rudy told TechCrunch. “When we wrote, we wrote lots of poetry together and things like that. That just becomes a connection — we were locked in before we’d ever had any romantic encounter.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developing a connection with a friend — even an internet friend — can help speed up the “getting to know you” process that typically comes with online dating, which users have begun to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/08/it-feels-like-admin-why-are-people-falling-out-of-love-with-dating-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">describe as “admin work”</a> or <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/dating-like-second-job\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a second job</a>. In contrast with dating apps, this way of meeting more naturally mimics the feel of meeting through friends.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">James Cassar, a writer in their 30s, found a similar sense of common ground with their partner Nicole. The couple originally met on Twitter, where they followed each other because they posted about the same niche rock bands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When they later matched on Tinder, they already recognized each other from the internet, allowing them to skip the small talk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When Nicole looked at my Tinder, she was like, ‘You like Cheem? I don’t know anyone that listens to Cheem,’ and I was like, ‘Then you must know that I’m that person [from Twitter],’” Cassar told TechCrunch. “It’s like a weird CAPTCHA — like, which underground indie band do you like?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though they had never spoken, they already knew a lot about each other, since they had been reading each other’s posts for years. And often, people are more open about their thoughts and feelings when they’re posting semi-anonymously to a crowd of internet strangers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that Twitter has changed how we communicate and has definitely changed how we relate to other people,” Cassar said. “It bypasses a lot of the social contract of like, ‘Oh, I’m gonna meet somebody in person, and we’re gonna get a coffee or something, and then I’m not gonna tell them this embarrassing thing about me until seven or eight dates in.’ Whereas on Twitter, you could be dropping lore every five seconds.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the internet permeating so much of our everyday lives, the separation between online and offline relationships can blur.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright\"><blockquote><p>The internet provides beautiful connections of all sorts, all the time.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, when a friendly stranger asked how I met my boyfriend, I was prepared to offer my canned version of the story: We were close friends for seven years, and after our friends pestered us about it long enough, we finally got together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My boyfriend’s answer was a bit more blunt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We met on a meme page,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With some surprise and amusement, I realized that his version of events was correct, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While we did start dating after many years of friendship, we first became friends because we were both moderators of a local Facebook meme group in 2017. We crossed paths in the irony-laden halls of <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/02/weird-facebook-became-cool-again.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“weird Facebook,”</a> the same collection of esoteric meme groups where Zeke and Owen met.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s always a responsible distance that people should put between their presence online and themselves,” Rudy said. “But I think the internet provides beautiful connections of all sorts, all the time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a bit weirder than meeting on Hinge, but so far, it’s working.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At one point, an app called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/08/twitterrific-comes-roaring-back-into-the-iphone-twitter-app-wars/\">Twitterrific</a> was one of the most popular iPhone apps for browsing Twitter. These days, the company behind that app, and the many apps that followed, is struggling. And AI may partially be to blame.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, the company known as the Iconfactory admitted it was at a crossroads and was putting up several of its apps for sale due to a lack of resources. While the <a href=\"https://blog.iconfactory.com/2025/07/apps-up-for-sale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement</a> positioned the matter as a situation where the Iconfactory’s app catalog had simply grown to include too many apps to keep up with and not enough time to do so, the reality is that the business today has no choice but to focus on the apps that offer a better return on investment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Side products can no longer be maintained, even if they have “loads of happy and loyal customers,” as the Iconfactory’s co-founder, Ged Maheux, says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says that it will continue to work on apps like <a href=\"https://usetapestry.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tapestry</a>, <a href=\"https://linea-app.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Linea Sketch</a>, <a href=\"https://wallaroo.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wallaroo</a>, and <a href=\"https://tot.rocks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tot</a>, as well as its new project involving <a href=\"https://iconfactory.com/pixelportraits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Retro Pixel Portraits</a>, but is accepting “serious offers” for the other apps. These sales will include intellectual property and source code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of particular interest is that the company points to AI significantly affecting its business as the reason.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“ChatGPT and other AI services are basically killing @Iconfactory, and I’m not exaggerating or being hyperbolical,” Iconfactory developer Sean Heber <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@bigzaphod/114835025353921777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a Mastodon</a> post earlier this month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue isn’t that people are using AI instead of mobile apps, but how vibe coding is affecting the need for app design firms like theirs. Besides building its own apps, the Iconfactory generated revenue by offering app <a href=\"https://iconfactory.com/services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">design services</a>, which include things like icon design (hence the name), app design, marketing asset creation, plus branding and consulting services.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These services helped fuel the business that’s now being destroyed by AI. “I know nothing I say is going to get anyone to stop using ChatGPT and generating a new app icon in 5 minutes for the app that you also had ChatGPT write for you in a few hours, but I’m not sure what the rest of us are supposed to do about making enough money to, ya know, live,” Heber wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another issue for the longtime app makers at the Iconfactory was the shutdown of its most popular app, Twitterrific, which was killed by Elon Musk in 2023 when the company (now known as X) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/19/twitter-officially-bans-third-party-clients-after-cutting-off-prominent-devs/\">officially banned all third-party clients</a>. The move put <a href=\"https://blog.iconfactory.com/2023/01/twitterrific-end-of-an-era/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Twitterrific</a>, <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tweetbot</a>, and other apps almost instantly out of business, leading the Iconfactory to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/twitter-apps-tweetbot-and-twitterific-ask-customers-to-decline-their-refunds-in-rare-app-store-exception/\">plead with its users to decline their App Store refunds</a> to help them stay afloat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That, too, has affected the Iconfactory’s future, Heber admitted in his posts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“First Twitter/Elon killed our main app revenue that kept the lights on around here, then generative AI exploded to land a final blow to design revenue,” he wrote. “I think perhaps because @Iconfactory design is quite good people have this impression that we’re sitting here on a pile of money or something and some huge powerhouse — nope. We’ve been barely making it since Elon/Twitter. There’s only 6 of us and there’s no war chest.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After shutting down Twitterrific, the Iconfactory turned to the open social web as a way to generate a new revenue stream. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/team-behind-twitterrific-launches-a-multi-feed-app-called-tapestry/\">launched an app called Tapestry</a>, which allows users to track sources across the open web, including RSS feeds, YouTube, Bluesky, podcasts, Mastodon, Reddit, Tumblr, Micro.blog, and others. The app <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/a-review-of-tapestry-an-app-powered-by-the-growing-open-web/\">offers a variety of clever tools</a> for organizing sources, making feeds, muting and hiding content you don’t want to see, and more. It also offered a way for third-party developers to extend Tapestry with add-ons called Connectors, allowing users to add even more open feeds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That app will remain a part of the company’s efforts for now — a Mac app is in the works — but even its future could be uncertain. For one thing, open social media platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky are still dwarfed by tech giants, which means consumer demand for something like Tapestry is fairly niche. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Heber <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@bigzaphod/114835029301935167\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared</a>, the app’s Kickstarter was a bit of a “Hail Mary” on the company’s part, but people aren’t subscribing in great enough numbers to make up for the revenue that Twitterrific once brought in, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If AI continues to commoditize the business of app making, the Iconfactory won’t be alone in suffering the consequences. But vibe-coded apps aren’t necessarily what consumers need, not only because of the lack of human input, but also the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/jack-dorsey-says-his-secure-new-bitchat-app-has-not-been-tested-for-security/\">lax security</a> some of these apps offer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reached for comment, Maheux agreed that AI had “definitely put a damper on the design side of our services,” though it hasn’t “killed” the company yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many indie developers have adopted AI for an inexpensive or free solution for graphical work like app icons, which has been a core part of the services we offer. We still do, of course, but the frequency of developers coming to us for these services has declined greatly in the last few years,” he told TechCrunch via email. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also cited other factors impacting the business, like Apple’s graphical system, SF Symbols, that developers can use instead. Consumers are tiring of subscriptions for everything. Plus, he points out that the cost of everything has increased over the years, while the cost of apps has not, making it harder to make a living as a small business developer.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve had to expand our offerings into other areas like UX consulting, coding consultation, and side revenue services to try and make up the revenue from this lost design work. Apple’s introduction of Liquid Glass has offered some new opportunities for design work and consultation, and we’ve been working with a handful of companies on this, so that’s been hopeful,” he noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated after publication with company comment.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Instead, usage is tracked via Poe’s existing point-based subscription plans, where each model call costs a set number of points. For instance, low-quality image generation through GPT-4o in a 1:1 aspect ratio and 1024 x 1024 size would cost 328 points.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Poe’s plans include the $4.99 per month plan (10,000 points per day), the $19.99/mo plan (1 million points per month), the $49.99/mo plan (2.5 million points per month), the $99.99/mo plan (5 million points per month), and the $249.99/mo plan (12.5 million points per month).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developers will also be able to buy additional points at a rate of $30 for 1 million tokens. Add-on tokens don’t come in a fixed package, so customers can pay any dollar amount to get tokens based on that rate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through this API, developers can power tools like Cursor, Cline, Continue, Roo, and any others that work with OpenAI-compatible chat completion APIs. The platform currently provides access to more than 100 models across voice, text, image, and video generation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These multimodal models include Imagen 4, GPT Image 1, Flux Kontext, Seedream 3.0, Veo 3, Runway Gen 4 Turbo, Kling 2.1, ElevenLabs, and Lyria.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3032708\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/API_architecture_D.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Quora</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Currently, we are working on allowing developers to take a private bot they have built on Poe and use that through an API. Plus, we are thinking about better key management for developers for the API product,” Gareth Jones, Poe’s product lead for creators and developers, told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While API provides a way for developers to use different models, Poe also offers tools aimed at consumers. Earlier this year, the company introduced a new way to allow <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/25/quoras-poe-now-lets-users-create-and-share-custom-ai-powered-apps/\">users to easily create AI-powered apps</a>. It also offers templates to build server bots, prompt bots, and image generation bots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the moment, developers will need to pick and manage model use manually. Jones said that the company will consider adding budget management functionality in the future, based on developer feedback.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
