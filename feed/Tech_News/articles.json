The investment comes as the company works to carve out a position in cross-border B2B payments, a market still dominated by banks and manual processes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series A round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from existing investors Square Peg, Stripe, Lightspeed, and Moore Capital, while PayPal Ventures joined as a new backer. The all-equity round values the Bengaluru-based startup at $85 million post-investment and brings its total funding to more than $32 million to date.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/07/india-stack-financial-access-and-digital-inclusion.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rapid digitization in domestic payments</a>, cross-border B2B transfers for Indian exporters <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/business/news/fintechs-eye-gains-as-rbi-opens-cross-border-payments/4076880/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remain heavily reliant on banks</a>, often with limited visibility into fees, settlement timelines, and the final amount received in rupees. The friction is particularly acute for larger exporters moving millions of dollars into India to fund salaries and local operations, creating an opening for fintech infrastructure players such as Xflow that promise greater transparency and speed in international money movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2021, Xflow provides cross-border payment infrastructure for businesses ranging from exporters and SaaS firms to platforms and freelancers, enabling them to collect international payments, manage foreign exchange, and settle funds in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Cross-border B2B payments were stuck in a different age compared to UPI,” co-founder Anand Balaji (pictured above, center) said in an interview, referring to India’s widely used instant domestic payments network, the Unified Payments Interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Balaji, who previously helped build out Stripe’s India business, founded Xflow with former Stripe colleagues Ashwin Bhatnagar (pictured above, right) and Abhijit Chandrasekaran (pictured above, left).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Xflow said it enabled Indian businesses to collect payments from more than 100 countries in over 25 currencies. It processed close to $1 billion in annualized cross-border payment volume last year, marking roughly 10-fold growth from the same period in 2024, Balaji told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the company, its customer base has expanded to about 15,000 businesses spanning SaaS firms, global capability centers (which are offshore units that multinationals operate in India), IT services exporters, freelancers, and fintech platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Transaction sizes vary widely by segment, with global capability centers averaging about $1 million to $2 million per transaction, goods exporters around $30,000 to $40,000, and freelancers roughly $3,000, according to Balaji.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xflow is positioning itself as a payments infrastructure provider rather than a direct payments application, offering APIs that allow platforms and exporters to embed cross-border money movement into their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We didn’t want to build the next Wise — we want to power the next thousand Wises,” Balaji said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has also introduced an AI-based foreign exchange tool to help finance teams optimize the timing of currency conversions. Xflow says the feature has generated incremental gains for some customers through data-driven foreign exchange decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool allows businesses to set target conversion rates rather than accepting prevailing bank quotes. Balaji likened the feature to limit orders in trading — instructions to buy or sell only at a specified price.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’ve added is the prediction layer and the ability to actually set a limit order,” he said. The model currently provides a three-day forecast with about 92% confidence, Balaji said, though TechCrunch could not independently verify that figure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xflow faces competition from banks that still dominate large cross-border B2B transfers, as well as fintech players such as Wise, Payoneer, and Skydo at the lower end of the market. But Balaji said the startup’s focus on high-value transactions and API-led infrastructure differentiates it from many rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup plans to deploy the new capital toward building additional products on top of its core payments infrastructure and securing regulatory licenses in new markets, Balaji said. Xflow is preparing to roll out import capabilities in the coming months and is pursuing licenses in markets including Singapore, while already holding a payments license in Canada, even as it remains focused on India as its primary market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xflow said it has also received final authorization from the Reserve Bank of India for a Payment Aggregator–Cross Border (PA-CB) license covering both exports and imports. The startup has signed platform partnerships with Easebuzz and Drip Capital to embed its cross-border capabilities into their offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Backing from Stripe and PayPal Ventures, Balaji said, has helped strengthen the startup’s credibility with banking and regulatory partners, even as it continues to work with multiple payment providers commercially.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently has about 65 employees as it scales its cross-border infrastructure business.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

She told her OpenClaw AI agent to check her overstuffed email inbox and suggest what to delete or archive.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agent proceeded to run amok. It started deleting all her email in a “speed run” while ignoring her commands from her phone telling it to stop. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb,” she wrote, posting images of the ignored stop prompts as receipts.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Mac Mini, an affordable Apple computer that sits flat on a desk and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/apple-mac-mini-m4-review-more-power-in-a-tiny-package/\">fits in the palm of your hand</a>, has become the favored device these days for running OpenClaw. (The Mini is selling “like hotcakes,” one “confused” Apple employee apparently told <a href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/2024987174077432126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">famed AI researcher Andrej Karpathy</a> when he bought one to run an OpenClaw alternative called NanoClaw.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/openclaw-creator-peter-steinberger-joins-openai/\">OpenClaw</a> is, of course, the open source AI agent that achieved fame through Moltbook, an AI-only social network. OpenClaw agents were at the center of that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/after-all-the-hype-some-ai-experts-dont-think-openclaw-is-all-that-exciting/\">now largely debunked episode</a> on Moltbook in which it looked like the AIs were plotting against humans.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But OpenClaw’s mission, according to its <a href=\"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GitHub page</a>, is not focused on social networks. It aims to be a personal AI assistant that runs on your own devices.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Silicon Valley in-crowd has fallen so in love with OpenClaw that “claw” and “claws” have become the <a href=\"https://x.com/simonw/status/2024999368982757509\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">buzzwords of choice</a> for agents that run on personal hardware. Other such agents include <a href=\"https://zeroclaw.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ZeroClaw</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IronClaw</a>, and <a href=\"https://picoclaw.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PicoClaw</a>. Y Combinator’s podcast team even appeared on their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8wVMdwhlh4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most recent episode</a> dressed in lobster costumes. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Yue’s post serves as a warning. As others on X noted, if an AI security researcher could run into this problem, what hope do mere mortals have? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?” a software developer asked her on X.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Rookie mistake tbh,” she replied. She had been testing her agent with a smaller “toy” inbox, as she called it, and it had been running well on less important email. It had earned her trust, so she thought she’d let it loose on the real thing. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yue believes that the large amount of data in her real inbox “triggered compaction,” she wrote. Compaction happens when the context window — the running record of everything the AI has been told and has done in a session — grows too large, causing the agent to begin summarizing, compressing, and managing the conversation.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that point, the AI may skip over instructions that the human considers quite important.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this case, it may have skipped her last prompt — where she told it not to act — and reverted back to its instructions from the “toy” inbox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As several others <a href=\"https://x.com/isik5/status/2025920413700641132\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on X pointed out</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/mikedelta221/status/2025936657396985983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prompts can’t be trusted</a> to act as security guardrails. Models may misconstrue or ignore them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Various people offered suggestions that ranged from the exact syntax Yue should have used to stop the agent, to various methods to ensure better adherence to guardrails, like writing instructions to dedicated files or using other open source tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the interest of full transparency, TechCrunch could not independently verify what happened to Yue’s inbox. (She didn’t respond to our request for comment, though she did respond to many questions and comments sent her way on X.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it doesn’t really matter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The point of the tale is that agents aimed at knowledge workers, at their current stage of development, are risky. People who say they are using them successfully are cobbling together methods to protect themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One day, perhaps soon (by 2027? 2028?), they may be ready for widespread use. Goodness knows many of us would love help with email, grocery orders, and scheduling dentist appointments. But that day has not yet come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The state DMV ruled that Tesla used deceptive marketing to overstate the automated driving capabilities of its vehicles, thereby violating state law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit reignites an issue that appeared to be resolved last week when the DMV said it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/tesla-dodges-30-day-suspension-in-california-after-removing-autopilot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">would not</a> suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days. This was because the EV maker complied with the ruling and stopped using the term “Autopilot” in its California marketing materials. CNBC was first to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/tesla-sues-california-dmv-to-reverse-false-advertising-ruling-on-fsd.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report the lawsuit</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV could have taken action against Tesla. It chose not to even though an administrative law judge agreed with the DMV’s request to suspend Tesla’s licenses for 30 days as a penalty. Instead of pulling its licenses, the state regulator gave Tesla 60 days to comply. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Tesla did, although in the most extreme ways. Tesla didn’t just stop using the term Autopilot; in January it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tesla-discontinues-autopilot-in-bid-to-boost-adoption-of-its-full-self-driving-software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">discontinued Autopilot</a> altogether in the U.S. and Canada. Perhaps it regrets that decision and is looking for a way to bring it back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

These include D1, Fidelity, and TPG.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of these was a bit shocking. Affiliated funds of BlackRock joined in Anthropic’s $30 billion raise even though BlackRock’s senior managing director and board member <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/openai-appoints-blackrock-exec-to-its-board/\">Adebayo Ogunlesi</a> is also on OpenAI’s board of directors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that world, it’s true that if various BlackRock funds get a chance to own OpenAI stock, they are likely to take it, never mind the personal association of a member of their senior leadership. (BlackRock runs every type of fund, including mutuals, closed-ends, and ETFs). And we all know the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/the-cracks-in-the-openai-microsoft-relationship-are-reportedly-widening/\">history of OpenAI and Microsoft’s relationship</a> and why Microsoft is hedging its bets. Ditto for Nvidia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But venture capital funds have — until now — operated differently. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">VCs market themselves as “founder friendly” and “helpful,” the idea being that when a VC firm buys a chunk of a startup’s company, the investor will help that startup be successful, particularly against its major rivals. If you are an owner of both OpenAI and Anthropic, who does your loyalty belong to, besides your own investors?  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, startups are private companies. They typically share confidential information with their direct investors on their business status — data that isn’t disclosed publicly the way it is with public companies. In many cases, the VCs also take board seats, which carries another level of fiduciary responsibility to their portfolio companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What makes this particular case even more interesting is that Sam Altman comes from the world of venture capital, as a former president of Y Combinator. He knows the drill. In 2024, he reportedly gave his investors <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-tells-investor-not-invest-five-ai-startups-including-sutskevers-ssi-2024-10-02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a list of OpenAI’s rivals</a> that he didn’t want them to back. It largely included companies launched by folks who left OpenAI, including Anthropic, xAI, and Safe Superintelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman later denied that he told OpenAI investors they would be barred from future rounds if they backed his list of perceived rivals. Altman did admit that he said if they “made non-passive investments,” they would no longer receive OpenAI’s confidential business information, according to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/\">documents in the lawsuit</a> between Elon Musk and OpenAI, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-denies-musk-claim-openai-investors-ban-rivals-2025-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Business Insider reported</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI is also breaking the mold because of the record-breaking amounts of money that the largest AI labs are raising as they experience never-before-seen growth (and never-before-seen data center needs). At some point, when the hat is being passed around, the needs are so great and the possibilities of returns are so large, who can be expected to say no? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It turns out that not all venture investors have yet slid down the slippery slope. Andreessen Horowitz backs OpenAI but not (yet) Anthropic. Menlo Ventures backs Anthropic but not (yet) OpenAI, for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, in our admittedly not exhaustive research, we found a dozen investors that appear to only have direct investments in one of these companies, not both. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others include Bessemer Venture Partners, General Catalyst, and Greenoaks. (Note: We originally asked Claude to give us the list of dual investors. It got almost as many entries wrong as it got right, so all this for a very cool tech whose work sometimes remains less trustworthy than an intern’s.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, as we previously reported, the fact that this longstanding rule has been tossed by some of the most respected firms in the Valley, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/sequoia-to-invest-in-anthropic-breaking-vc-taboo-on-backing-rivals-ft/\">like Sequoia, is notable</a>. One investor we reached out to simply shrugged and said that as long as the firm doesn’t have a board seat, no one sees the harm in it anymore.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, conflict-of-interest policies should now become another thing that founders ask about before signing that term sheet, no matter who it’s from. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

wrong — it’s the weather, right? It’s one of the hardest things to predict,” Grossman told TechCrunch via a telephone interview. “And our biggest pet peeve with a lot of weather apps is you just get their best guess, and you don’t know how certain they are.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Having an understanding of the alternatives helps people plan for big events, he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I find it most useful for winter storms, where, maybe the storm starts out in the morning, and you’re going to get snow, but maybe there’s also a possibility it holds out a little bit later — to the afternoon — in which case it’s rain,” Gross explained. “Being able to just see that right there on the timeline just gives you this intuitive sense of whether, do all the models agree, and you’re getting snow? Or do half of them say snow and half of them say rain?” he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This type of weather data could make for a valuable product, not just for consumers, but for other developers, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Dark Sky, the team had offered its weather API to developers for a fee. After being acquired by Apple, the team worked on creating <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WeatherKit</a>, the developer toolkit that provides access to Apple’s weather data on a subscription basis. Grossman said the team hasn’t yet decided if a developer API will be a part of Acme Weather’s offering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, Acme Weather is a $25-per-year consumer app, with a two-week free trial. This helps to cover the costs involved with pulling in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://acmeweather.com/datasources\">different weather models and resources</a>, which can be expensive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of our time has been spent on building our own forecast — our own data provider, in a way. And this lets us do things like build multiple forecasts … [and] create any map we want, rather than having to rely on a third-party map provider,” Grossman noted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, the app offers a range of maps, like radar, lightning, rain and snow totals, as well as wind, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and hurricane tracks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another feature, Community Reports, lets users share information about their current conditions to improve the app’s real-time weather reporting. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095737\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png 1290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=300,249 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=768,637 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=680,564 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=1200,995 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=1280,1062 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=430,357 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=720,597 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=900,747 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=800,664 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=668,554 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=452,375 452w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=744,617 744w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=640,531 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Acme Weather</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Dark Sky had become a favorite weather app because of its uncanny ability to predict when it would begin raining in your location, Acme Weather aims to improve on this and even have some fun. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app includes built-in notifications for typical things, like rain, nearby lightning, community reports, government-issued severe weather alerts, and more.

OpenAI sent a memo to House lawmakers earlier this month accusing DeepSeek of using distillation to mimic its products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepSeek first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/how-deepseek-changed-silicon-valleys-ai-landscape/\">made waves</a> a year ago when it released its open source R1 reasoning model that nearly matched American frontier labs in performance at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek is expected to soon release DeepSeek V4, its latest model, which <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> can outperform Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in coding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scale of each attack differed in scope. Anthropic tracked more than 150,000 exchanges from DeepSeek that seemed aimed at improving foundational logic and alignment, specifically around censorship-safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moonshot AI had more than 3.4 million exchanges targeting agentic reasoning and tool use, coding and data analysis, computer-use agent development, and computer vision. Last month, the firm <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/chinas-moonshot-releases-a-new-open-source-model-kimi-k2-5-and-a-coding-agent/\">released</a> a new open source model Kimi K2.5 and a coding agent.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MiniMax’s 13 million exchanges targeted agentic coding and tool use and orchestration. Anthropic said it was able to observe MiniMax in action as it redirected nearly half its traffic to siphon capabilities from the latest Claude model when it was launched. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says it will continue to invest in defenses that make distillation attacks harder to execute and easier to identify, but is calling on “a coordinated response across the AI industry, cloud providers, and policymakers.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The distillation attacks come at a time when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/a-timeline-of-the-u-s-semiconductor-market-in-2025/\">American chip exports</a> to China are still hotly debated. Last month, the Trump administration formally allowed U.S. companies like Nvidia to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/department-of-commerce-may-approve-nvidia-h200-chip-exports-to-china/\">export advanced AI chips </a>(like the H200) to China. Critics have argued that this loosening of export controls increases China’s AI computing capacity at a critical time in the global race for AI dominance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says that the scale of extraction DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot performed “requires access to advanced chips.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,” per Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-and-preventing-distillation-attacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/crowdstrikes-former-cto-on-cyber-rivalries-and-how-automation-can-undermine-security-for-early-stage-startups/\">Dmitri Alperovitch</a>, chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think-tank and co-founder of CrowdStrike, told TechCrunch he’s not surprised to see these attacks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s been clear for a while now that part of the reason for the rapid progress of Chinese AI models has been theft via distillation of U.S. frontier models. Now we know this for a fact,” Alperovitch said. “This should give us even more compelling reasons to refuse to sell any AI chips to any of these [companies], which would only advantage them further.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic also said distillation doesn’t only threaten to undercut American AI dominance, but could also create national security risks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anthropic and other U.S. companies build systems that prevent state and non-state actors from using AI to, for example, develop bioweapons or carry out malicious cyber activities,” reads Anthropic’s blog post. “Models built through illicit distillation are unlikely to retain those safeguards, meaning that dangerous capabilities can proliferate with many protections stripped out entirely.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic pointed to authoritarian governments deploying frontier AI for things like “offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance,” a risk that is multiplied if those models are open sourced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot for comment. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Uber has backed many of these companies — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/uber-makes-multi-million-dollar-investment-in-lucid-nuro-to-build-robotaxi-service/\">Lucid and Nuro</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/waabi-raises-1b-and-expands-into-robotaxis-with-uber/\">Waabi</a>, and China’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/uber-invests-100m-in-weride-to-fuel-robotaxi-expansion-across-15-more-cities/\">WeRide</a> — invested $100 million to build fast-charging, autonomous-vehicle charging stations, and even launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/uber-launches-an-av-labs-division-to-gather-driving-data-for-robotaxi-partners/\">Uber AV Labs</a>, a specialized engineering team that will gather data for robotaxi partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has made the partnerships and investments; now it wants to make itself indispensable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AV tech teams should be able to focus on what they do best: building software that can safely power an autonomous world,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s global head of autonomous mobility and delivery, who will be leading the initiative. The idea, he said, is to add “operational depth wherever they need it,” including demand generation, rider experience, customer support, or managing the day-to-day fleet operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end goal is to help these companies reduce their costs per mile and increase the speed to market. Uber said it plans to help these partners scale robotaxi deployments to <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/J3LNCnGAzAhnrM2GcEuLIJqIJU?domain=s23.q4cdn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 15 cities by the end of this year</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What’s going to determine the success or failure of autonomous in the world is whether it can be commercialized, and Uber is going to be the thing that makes autonomy commercially viable,” Uber President and COO Andrew MacDonald said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Uber that means handling infrastructure like training data and mapping, fleet financing, regulatory services, and managing how robotaxis and other AVs navigate complex events and venues. The company said it is using a fleet of specially equipped Lucid vehicles to collect data that can be shared with partners so they can train their AI systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new division also plans to tackle user experience, including customer support. Notably, Uber wants to take over fleet management, which would include remote assistance — an issue that recently received attention from federal lawmakers over concerns <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/22/techcrunch-mobility-waymo-makes-its-defense/\">Waymo uses workers overseas</a>. Fleet management would also cover insurance and employing the humans who might need to support these AVs when they’re out in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber’s move is both existential and opportunistic. The company sold its in-house AV development unit known as Uber ATG in 2020, following two years of internal struggles and pressure after one of its test vehicles killed a pedestrian. (Uber sold off the division in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">complex deal with Aurora</a>.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has tried to shore up its position through partnerships and investments. And there have been plenty. Uber and Waymo have a shared robotaxi service in Atlanta and Austin. The company has also locked up partnerships with Chinese firms Baidu, Momenta, and Pony.ai, sidewalk delivery bot companies Cartken, Starship, and Serve, and the U.K.-based automated driving tech startup Wayve, as well as robotaxi developers AVride and Motional, to name a few. It has plans to launch a robotaxi service with Volkswagen in Los Angeles by the end of 2026 — although it won’t be driverless until 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These do provide Uber with some protection, but it doesn’t provide a replacement to any revenue lost if these companies erode its own ride-hailing and food delivery business that is today powered by human drivers. Uber is hoping this new division will. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It gives him a high-level view of how companies are actually using AI models, and what still needs to be done to unleash the potential of agentic AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I spoke with Gerstenhaber, I was particularly struck by one idea I hadn’t heard before. As he put it, AI models are pushing against three frontiers at once: raw intelligence, response time, and a third quality that has less to do with raw capability than with cost — whether a model can be deployed cheaply enough to run at massive, unpredictable scale. It’s a new way of thinking about model capabilities, and a particularly valuable one for anyone trying to push frontier models in a new direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Why don’t you start by walking us through your experience in AI so far, and what you do at Google.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’ve been in AI for about two years now. I was at Anthropic for a year and a half, I’ve been at Google almost half a year now. I run Vertex AI, Google’s developer platform. Most of our customers are engineers building their own applications. They want access to agentic patterns. They want access to an agentic platform. They want access to the inference of the smartest models in the world. I provide them that, but I don’t provide the applications themselves. That’s for Shopify, Thomson Reuters, and our various customers to provide in their own domains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What drew you to Google?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is I think unique in the world in that we have everything from the interface to the infrastructure layer. We can build data centers. We can buy electricity and build power plants. We have our own chips. We have our own model. We have the inference layer that we control. We have the agentic layer we control. We have APIs for memory, for interleaved code writing. We have an agent engine on top of that that ensures compliance and governance. And then we even have the chat interface with Gemini enterprise and Gemini chat for consumers, right? So part of the reason I came here is because I saw Google as uniquely vertically integrated, and that being a strength for us.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>It’s odd because, even with all the differences between companies, it feels like all three of the big labs are really</strong> <strong>close in capabilities. Is it just a race for more intelligence, or is it more complicated than that?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I see three boundaries. Models like Gemini Pro are tuned for raw intelligence. Think about writing code. You just want the best code you can get, doesn’t matter if it takes 45 minutes, because I have to maintain it, I have to put it in production. I just want the best.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s this other boundary with latency. If I’m doing customer support and I need to know how to apply a policy, you need intelligence to apply that policy. Are you allowed to transact a return? Can I upgrade my seat on an airplane? But it doesn’t matter how right you are if it took 45 minutes to get the answer. So for those cases, you want the most intelligent product within that latency budget, because more intelligence no longer matters once that person gets bored and hangs up the phone. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then there’s this last bucket, where somebody like Reddit or Meta wants to moderate the entire internet. They have large budgets, but they can’t take an enterprise risk on something if they don’t know how it scales. They don’t know how many poisonous posts there will be today or tomorrow. So they have to restrict their budget to a model at the highest intelligence they can afford, but in a scalable way to an infinite number of subjects. And for that, cost becomes very, very important.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>One of the things I’ve been puzzling about is why agentic systems are taking so long to catch on. It feels like the models are there and I’ve seen incredible demos, but we’re not seeing the kind of major changes I would have expected a year ago. What do you think is holding it back?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This technology is basically two years old, and there’s still a lot of missing infrastructure. We don’t have patterns for auditing what the agents are doing. We don’t have patterns for authorization of data to an agent. There are these patterns that are going to require work to put into production. And production is always a trailing indicator of what the technology is capable of. So two years isn’t long enough to see what the intelligence supports in production, and that’s where people are struggling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think it’s moved uniquely quickly in software engineering because it fits nicely in the software development lifecycle. We have a dev environment in which it’s safe to break things, and then we promote from the dev environment to the test environment. The process of writing code at Google requires two people to audit that code and both affirm that it’s good enough to put Google’s brand behind and give to our customers. So we have a lot of those human-in-the-loop processes that make the implementation exceptionally low-risk. But we need to produce those patterns in other places and for other professions.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, the company open sourced an 8-billion-parameter LLM, <a href=\"https://github.com/guidelabs/steerling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Steerling-8B</a>, trained with a new architecture designed to make its actions easily interpretable: Every token produced by the model can be traced back to its origins in the LLM’s training data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That can be as simple as determining the reference materials for facts cited by the model, or as complex as understanding the model’s understanding of humor or gender.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If I have a trillion ways to encode gender, and I encode it in 1 billion of the 1 trillion things that I have, you have to make sure you find all those 1 billion things that I’ve encoded, and then you have to be able to reliably turn that on, turn them off,” Adebayo told TechCrunch. “You can do it with current models, but it’s very fragile … It’s sort of one of the holy grail questions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adebayo began this work while earning his PhD at MIT, co-authoring a widely cited <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03292\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2018 paper</a> that showed existing methods of understanding deep learning models were not reliable. That work ultimately led to the creation of a new way of building LLMs: Developers insert a concept layer in the model that buckets data into traceable categories. This requires more up-front data annotation, but by using other AI models to help, they were able to train this model as their largest proof of concept yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The kind of interpretability people do is … neuroscience on a model, and we flip that,” Adebayo said. “What we do is actually engineer the model from the ground up so that you don’t need to do neuroscience.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095647\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png 1648w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=768,451 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=680,399 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=1200,705 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=1280,752 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=430,253 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=720,423 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=900,529 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=800,470 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=1536,902 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=668,392 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=638,375 638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=1050,617 1050w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=708,416 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Guide Labs</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One concern with this approach is that it might eliminate some of the emergent behaviors that make LLMs so intriguing: Their ability to generalize in new ways about things they haven’t been trained on yet. Adebayo says that still happens in his company’s model: His team tracks what they call “discovered concepts” that the model discovered on its own, like quantum computing.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adebayo argues this interpretable architecture will be something everyone needs. For consumer-facing LLMs, these techniques should allow model builders to do things like block the use of copyrighted materials, or better control outputs around subjects like violence or drug abuse. Regulated industries will require more controllable LLMs — for example, in finance — where a model evaluating loan applicants needs to consider things like financial records but not race. There’s also a need for interpretability in scientific work, another area where Guide Labs has developed technology. Protein folding has been a big success for deep learning models, but scientists need more insight into why their software figured out promising combinations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This model demonstrates that training interpretable models is no longer a sort of science; it’s now an engineering problem,” Adebayo said. “We figured out the science and we can scale them, and there is no reason why this kind of model wouldn’t match the performance of the frontier level models,” which have many more parameters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Guide Labs says that Steerling-8B can achieve 90% of the capability of existing models, but uses less training data, thanks to its novel architecture. The next step for the company, which emerged from Y Combinator and raised a $9 million seed round from Initialized Capital in November 2024, is to build a larger model and begin offering API and agentic access to users.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way we’re currently training models is super primitive, and so democratizing inherent interpretability is actually going to be a long-term good thing for our role within the human race,” Adebayo told TechCrunch. “As we’re going after these models that are going to be super intelligent, you don’t want something to be making decisions on your behalf that’s sort of mysterious to you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Instead of searching for individual songs or artists, users can describe the vibe, scenario, or inspiration they want, and Spotify will take care of the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To access the feature, users tap “Create” and then select “Prompted Playlist,” then enter any prompt in English. The feature is designed to interpret themes including moods, aesthetics, and even memories. Prompts can be as broad or specific as the user wants, referencing musical eras, genres, activities, lyrics, instruments, or even requesting a playlist inspired by a TV show, movie, or personal milestone. Users can also specify whether they want the playlist to include mostly new music or just music from their library in the prompt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once a prompt is submitted, Spotify’s AI generates a customized playlist tailored to the request. The system draws on the user’s listening history and incorporates current music and cultural trends. Plus, each song comes with a short explanation that offers insight into why it was chosen for that particular playlist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can refine their playlists by adjusting their prompts or starting over. For those whose musical tastes constantly evolve, playlists can be scheduled to automatically refresh on a daily or weekly basis.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095587\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because this is still in beta, Spotify noted that there might be changes as the company gets feedback, and that there are currently usage limits in place.

The move will see IQM join the growing cohort of quantum computing companies listed on U.S. stock markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2018 as a spinout from Finland’s Aalto University and VTT Technical Research, IQM commercializes both on-premises full-stack quantum computers and a cloud platform to access its systems, with clients including academic and industrial labs around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Public quantum companies <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-13/infleqtion-s-public-debut-to-test-quantum-frenzy-s-staying-power\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have seen their stocks surge in recent months</a>, fueled by signals from governments and Big Tech that the “quantum advantage” over regular supercomputers may soon be within reach. This has led believers to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/22/quantonations-double-sized-second-fund-shows-quantum-still-has-believers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">double down</a>, with the conviction that the field will soon have lucrative real-life applications in life sciences, new materials, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Going public will provide IQM with an extended runway to support its commercial plans. The company reported $35 million in 2025 revenue and over $100 million in bookings. With the close of this transaction, its cash position will exceed $450 million. But the company could also see its market cap trend upward or downward, depending on how investor appetite for quantum stocks has evolved when it begins trading.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With industrial applications still years away, questions remain as to whether the current quantum frenzy will last. These questions arise to an even greater extent because most of these companies went public via SPACs — a route that is faster than a traditional IPO, but that peaked in 2021 and left many investors nursing losses in its wake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite this sour aftertaste, quantum SPACs are back in fashion. Earlier this month, neutral-atom quantum company Infleqtion <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-17/quantum-firm-infleqtion-jumps-in-debut-after-klein-led-spac-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">jumped in its debut</a> on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) via a SPAC, with Canadian firm Xanadu Quantum Technologies planning to go public via a SPAC on the Nasdaq by the end of March. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, IQM is following in their footsteps but considers entering the public markets on both a U.S. and Nordic exchange. In the U.S., it may go public either on the Nasdaq or on the NYSE — the blank check company, in its case, is a Nasdaq-listed vehicle, Real Asset Acquisition Corp., but as a foreign company, it will list American Depositary Shares, and the listing is subject to approval.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iqm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Crunchbase</a>, IQM has raised some $569.1 million to date.

The backdoor allowed the hackers to gain access to 119 other unnamed organizations that used the company’s same VPN product.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mandiant was reportedly aware of the breaches as well, alerting Ivanti that hackers had exploited the bug to breach European and U.S. military contractors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The previously unreported breach is the latest example of how acquisitions, layoffs, and cost-cutting driven by private equity firms helped to compromise the quality and security of Ivanti’s most critical technologies. After private investment giant Clearlake Capital Group acquired Ivanti in 2017, Bloomberg reported rounds of cuts — particularly in 2022 — affecting employees who had deep institutional knowledge of the company’s products and their security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ivanti’s spokesperson Carrie Laudie disputed Bloomberg’s reporting and said there was “never a backdoor planted by hackers in Connect Secure.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mandiant did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg’s findings echo earlier reporting into rival provider of remote access tools, Citrix, which had <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2023/01/11/company-created-by-citrix-tibco-merger-confirms-it-has-laid-off-15-of-staff/#!\">large-scale layoffs</a> following a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/31/citrix-to-be-acquired-by-vista-and-evergreen-elliott-in-a-16-5b-all-cash-deal-will-be-merged-with-tibco-to-create-saas-powerhouse/\">2022 deal</a> by Elliott Investment Management and Vista Equity Partners to buy the company. Like Ivanti, Citrix has been mired by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/citrix-bleed-critical-bug-ransomware-mass-cyberattacks/\">cybersecurity incidents</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/cisa-confirms-hackers-are-actively-exploiting-critical-citrix-bleed-2-bug/\">critical flaws</a> in recent years. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ivanti’s VPN products have been the cause of at least two other major attacks since. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early 2024, U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/cisa-federal-agencies-disconnect-ivanti-vpn/\">ordered all federal agencies to disconnect</a> their Ivanti VPN appliances within two days because hackers were actively exploiting vulnerabilities that were unknown to Ivanti at the time.

The scenario imagines a report from two years in the future, in which unemployment has doubled, and the total value of the stock market has fallen by more than a third. As the report puts it:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI capabilities improved, companies needed fewer workers, white collar layoffs increased, displaced workers spent less, margin pressure pushed firms to invest more in AI, AI capabilities improved…</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a negative feedback loop with no natural brake…The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a new kind of bear case, focused not on Skynet-style misalignment but on the gradual unspooling of the economy itself. In particular, the Citrini scenario looks at the implications of integrating AI agents into the economy at large, and what it would mean when outside contractors get replaced by cheaper in-house AI. It’s similar to the <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/is-saas-dead-rethinking-the-future-of-software-in-the-age-of-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Death of SaaS</a> scenario, but Citrini goes further, implicating any business model that involves optimizing transactions between companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As you might expect, the report is causing <a href=\"https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2025894184817684633\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">quite</a> a <a href=\"https://x.com/Citrini7/status/2025804144070561907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stir</a> online. Not everyone is buying it — even Citrini describes it as more of a scenario than a prediction — but it’s not so easy to name the specific point where you think the scenario goes wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Personally, I’m not sure companies are ready to hand off purchasing decisions to AI agents, no matter how smart they are. But in Citrini’s scenario, most of the impacted decisions have already been handed off to third-party contractors, so it’s not quite as implausible as it seems.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

It’s unclear whether he’s bluffing — replacing Anthropic would be a significant undertaking.

On Android, the interface is a bit different, as you can access the dictionary through a floating bubble. You can hold the bubble and dictate, or press once to start, and then press the close button to stop the process. Just like on other platforms, in addition to dictation, the app cleans up the filter words and also formats the text based on the context of the app and spoken content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Android finally gave us the freedom to build the voice experience we always wanted. Only when the platform gets out of the way can we truly expect voice to replace typing on mobile,” Tanay Kothari, co-founder and CEO of the startup, said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app can support translation in over 100 languages and can work across other apps. Along with the Android app release, Wispr Flow said that it has done an infrastructure rewrite that makes dictation 30% faster than before. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there are tons of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/the-best-ai-powered-dictation-apps-of-2025/\">AI-powered dictation apps available on desktop and iOS</a>, Wispr Flow is one of the few available on Android with this launch, besides Typeless, which launched <a href=\"https://x.com/huang_song_/status/2013522407055860072\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an app for the platform last month</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, the company has also released a new model for Hinglish, a mix of Hindi and English, for people in India who speak in mix-coded way. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re someone like me, English and Hindi weave together when I’m chatting with family and colleagues back home.

Other reported possibilities: the iPhone 17e, an iPad Air with an M4 chip, a new entry-level iPad, an upgraded MacBook Air, and new MacBook Pro models. Gurman said all of those products are due this spring, but he sounded less certain about which ones will be announced when.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"
